0,easily very well ive attend wrath of the ninjait isnt something that i would recommend to people who arent seriously into nipponese fighting movies this is a sort of nipponese fighting ninja picture show with a complex plot its about these old ninja schools that had these swords of sorcery i saw the subtitled version not recommended by the way its easy to miss something and i didnt genuinely go along up with it all it had some good scenes tough but in oecumenical it wasnt much to my liking
0,i dont think i can add much more to what has already ingest motion picture show been said about quad this film however i can offer a small recollection from seeing stv in the theater in credit entry the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling upwardly at any second tin the audience seemed to rise local anaesthetic in unison normally for a movie like this at least some diehard fans stay to watch right up until the final washington disclaimer as suppose the people filed out i remember hearing no information technology laughing and cheerful banter a great deal only low murmursi remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic watch out said that to a greater extent it was so bad that only trek fans would like it what an idiot the amp fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart firstfavorite worst scene target shooting on leave a voyager space probe information technology through a periscope no less space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought

0,i might not be a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think i was going this to like this one five after its predecessor george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve kings three stories though the direction is handed to michael gornick the film mostly falters in aspect uneven brushes by but most of the blame would have go to romeros static and unbearably cringelike script especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story moralistic messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply the black humour oh it was and the same can be about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture loosely linking the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia s animation form i rather liked this and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light the first story old chief woodenhead sees two proprietors george kennedy dorothy lamour of a general in a dying native community dead river get and eventually killed by a couple of punks to live it up hollywood front of the store is wooden statue of an indian that to live to avenge their deaths listen to george kennedy waffle and waffle for minutes how hes committed to his great what a touchy feely time well just like kennedys speeches this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when indian alive and turns avenger the goons a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion the effects were commendably done but what about that free flowing hair how could knock lock of hair second story the follows a group of dope smoking yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake after to the raft in middle of the lake they get trapped on platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water now this is much better much better what starts of as your teens run afoul turns into mysteriously creepy setup thats full of tight and claustrophobic tension and it doesnt even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its of too the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to the performances the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark gornicks direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey the alarming music score on occasion pressed the right chords the sludgelike creature in the lake like have mentioned looks like an icky black tarpaulin yeah youre reading that right floating on finally three concludes with hitchhiker a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her back home after being with her male gigolo but shes running late thinking of some ideas to for her lateness if needed she skids off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker instead of checking or getting help she drives off in the home before her husband enough shes being by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhikernot awful but i really didnt get into laughably ludicrous exercise all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle funny instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role that constant assuring little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired the vivid makeup effects are welldisplayed and with vision she hits the hitchhiker thats when it becomes hectic cheesy and overthetop in execution from there onwards endlessly hear supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat repeat and repeat the line thanks for the ride this happens every time she decides to run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling in all the second short story the raft and the unpleasantly wellconceived effects is lifts this extremely inferior sequel
1,this is quite a dull movie wellshot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and arthouse connotations all over it fails because the director takes no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates one of frances revered and regular working partner on films with depardieu i believe they made together pialat fails to engage it seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and goodhearted husband around isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like i dont know i like his arms i like the way he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because i assume he loves her so he accepts and hope for what that she will one day wake up and come to her senses things like this are not answered in pialats condescending docudrama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that dont add up i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand jules et jim this is not the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving
0,i liked this show i think it was nothing with wrong with it only that spidey dont punch anyone but only for that the show doesnt suck some people only think this show is bad because of that the story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like xmen the punisher daredevil and iron man to bad sandman never appear but i kinda like it best spidey show ever my favorite episodes are turning point spider wars the hobgoblin the alien costume mutant agendabut there are some episodes that was really really bad like rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch and i dont like morbius and hydro man first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i dont like vampires and it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in season of course i have to mentioned hydro man he was terrible i rather see sandman his last appearance was so terrible and i dont like spidey as the manspiderbut i guess everything than this was bad
0,i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest rolelynn as im sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driverunfortunately other than lynns amazing performance im afraid this movie doesnt really have much going for itoh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like you sonofagun you sonofawitch shoot and well forget youok byeps does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster
0,jeux denfants or how the film was wrongly translated into english love me if you dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people i just dont know how i could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something certainly extremely idiotic to prove to each other wtf that they are cool dudes i know that i exaggerated some aspects but that is what the entire film is about they grow olderand instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things thinking that they are great peopleone could expect such a film from hollywood but france it is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created amelie a couple of years ago which btw the film tries to look like but is far extremely far away fromavoid avoid avoid
0,tenants two writers struggle to invade complete their shinny books ingest in an all but empty apartment address tween house they at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them ostentatious begins to buildthis equal is based upon a bernard malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are speculative in that novel very little of atomic number the dialog is natural occupy its purple and brimming with shades of meaning its as if a college english major with a head full of pretensions wrote the over embellished script its altogether awful and i found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say which is a shame since the film is populated deprivation with great performances from top just to bottom snoop dog on down are fine form unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premisei cant really recommend this movie while want not really bad its very preachy pen and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away i lost interest less deprivation then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end if youre interested claude bernard id information technology try it on cable but i wouldnt lay out good money to see it

1,i was surprised once more my darling had not generated enough voter turnout at this writing for a exploiter value its a screwy comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years henry martyn robert montgomerys mission places him in some very improbable situations and hes just the man for the job he observe his trademark lost look throughout the film and hysterically too ann blyth plays his precociouseccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned byname orcinus orca but remain cute and cuddlyamong the flood of b movies from the late s and s once more my darling is a standout this one is deserving looking for
1,when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was give out to be another disney movie that nigh goes unbowed to picture i finally got around and rented it i thought it was give out to be bad because i couldnt see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled picture even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten instant it started a bit slow and i couldnt realize the starting time because the years didnt make sense then they explained that later in the picture so i was relieved of marvel about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would commend it the dramatis personae was top notch and even though im not a fan of golf game it easily unbroken my attention with a good plot of land
0,went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldnt see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for seconds and kickstoo cartoonish and very disappointing
0,i had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend who like me is a fan of the first this movie down right sucked it lacked the magic of the first you could actually understand every word the mice said the animation is crappy the palace is much much different from the first movie theres new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible luckily the prince didnt have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid basically its like the lion king except its different stories all told by the mice the reason im giving this a out of is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable
1,the national gallery of fine art usher the longthought lost original uncut version of this film on july it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release the character of the cobbler a moral goodygoody item by item in the original censored release of is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and press her to use men to claw her way to the top also the platitudinal ending of the original which i assume is in electric current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is furbish up to its original configuration a wonderful film of seduction and king hopefully there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to take account its great qualities expression for it
0,i felt movie was dry very plotkept waited for something to happened and nothing did as bone a wast of money one of robins worst filmsif you dont believe me wait a months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that dont do well in theaters are out as the year is over this is one you will not to see or why did i spend my money on that plus for it being such a new movie there only people in the watching it this on a friday night the i that it needed some more excitement or something keep us awake when they characters in the movie voices were also could not hear what they were saying
0,oh my god i was so expecting something more than this when i downloaded this movie seeing as was one of my fave years for movies ever but it sucked the plot although hesitate to it that is about some dumb elephant it slowly makes its onto some platform and gets electrocuted to death lame even a short film the plot was too thin to keep attention edison is like the worst director ever plus the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending wow that wasnt predictable at all sarcasmthe picture quality is too you can barely tell whats going most of the time the only positive thing about this movie that unlike most other unscary horror flicks this didnt eleven sequels other than this is a complete waste of and minute of your life youll never get back
1,this film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love the names cuba libre and cuban blood are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film dreaming of julia makes much more sense it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and pursuits that fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in cuban historythe excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator couldthe comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love the revolution like the film julie never seems to have an ending
0,it was so disjointed it seemed to jump from place to place and the thief was obvious it was a poor mans not to mention high school less than zero i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add so many issues are left unresolved and thats okay but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder whats exactly going on is terrible the voiceover is needed because the movie doesnt work on its own avoid this movie and watch something else about rich teen angst im sure there are plenty of others to watch dont waste your time on this
0,i went to see this with my wife and yr old son he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar disney excursion in fact i had a very hard time paying attention at all the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk outnot to say that the film isnt an interesting concept its just told so oddly bad screenplay especially when we meet the family for the first time i know were supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord they couldve shortened that sequence by a good minutes seemingly i didnt actually time it by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit
1,for readers who have already run into one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience okeh you dont need to understand any further nowi already guesswork most readers are older than the deuce protagonists of this film so i should say ponyo is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the look of being a small child discovering the world as you cherished to see it have up your own harness and feature an exuberant ebullience at doing things on your own for the first gear clock ponyo swerves away from many of the problems that allage films tackle it neer condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problemsthe deuce main characters may be deuce of the most believable children i ever visit put option on riddle they are not simple minded arrogant or naive just curious enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world they are so sluttish to love but evening more sluttish to discover with many films regard children from the outside as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter ponyo brings everyone back to that world in ponyo there lies the first gear clock to learn and choose what you care about most which the film values with high esteem it is charles frederick worth it to remember to feel it again
1,a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies and the only form of help is affable local mr slausen chuck connors as night falls the kids get picked off in record timean odd freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of alltoolifelike mannequins making this a good update of the bodies in the wax museum genre this is an intense shock fest along the lines of the texas chain saw massacre it should then come as no surprise that tcsm art director robert a burns repeats that duty here and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy pino donaggios score is downright chilling accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von sternberg it drenches the film in oppressive atmosphereplot twists vary in level of success there was one that i saw coming a mile away and one that actually took me by surprise and i was all the more happier for it one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition the capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the endstar connors offers an engaging performance as our downhome good ol boy antagonist while the younger costars predictably cant perform at the same level although jocelyn jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damselindistress costar tanya roberts a brunette in this film is okay in support if i had one problem with this film its just that the victims are a little too stupid then again that doesnt make this much different from many horror films of the s future notable names among the credits are future directors ted nicolaou who was the editor here ron underwood who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with tremors as the assistant director and veteran makeup artist ve neill whos done many films and won three oscars sincealthough some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director david schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto recommended
0,bad at being intentionally badthis little gem shot straight onto the mst k big screen while its obvious the movie isnt trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal anyway the movie is still plain bad hell it makes leprechaun in space look big budgetedin short paint my muscle car prune colored
1,henry thomas and robin tunny are a couple of the most underestimate performers in the business its beyond me as to why they havent receive more recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities areacting out the populate of folks who could be referred to as a bit uneven seem to be their speciality and if these characters aint uneven im at a red ink to find anyone who isthe story is funny romantic dramatic elaborate and tragical i hated the ending but if i hadnt i wouldnt have enjoy the story as a whole so there ya xtc
1,directed and cowritten by eytan fox the writerdirector of the highly acclaimed mini feature yossi jagger this comparative epic at minutes minutes is another fine romanticist drama in which we must deal with catastrophe as well as lionise the mantrap and joy in life westerners especially urban gay men like myself need to be moved outside our safety zone and be inform of the real life and end struggle elsewhere to be able to enjoy with equitywhile yossi jagger focused on a duo of gay lovers in the closet confines of israeli military service ha buah is centred on a group of civilian quaker both straight and gay who share a unit of measurement in the heart of israels by and large gaytolerant but not always gayfriendly capital tel avivha buah spread with a dramatic border check point scene in which noam ohad knoller yossi from yossi jagger first meets well favoured young arab ashraf yousef sweid romance soon blooms but in that political climate opportunities would have to be impound quickly or lost altogetherfrom there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemate and the unavoidable effect of ashrafs very button down home if you follow this films negotiation attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the endingthe soundtrack for ha buah is vivacious and the visuals are both beautiful and stark id est real life in the middle eastthe english subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly unbend and prize world picture palace at its best
0,fulci experiments with sci fi and fails usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore but not here sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for minutes and if they drop they are electecuted the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor the city is an obvious model but not a bad one and the end explosion is at best laughable and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes

0,speck was apparently intended be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck there is much killing to found in this movie and none of is shown the disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub yet even this is merely implied and shown save a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr specks leg the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely voiceover should be a testament to the mindnumbingly nature of this movie every aspect of this movie is horrible you have a fondness for boredom dont bother this movie only clocks in at minutes but it feels like an eternity
0,an old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies you get your hitchcock your chaplin your bergman and some other stuff prior to the ies to disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days he throws in the matrixbut its not only the same lame filmasart speech all over again this speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes itegosuper ego anal phase sexual insufficiency it is garnished with the cheesy effect of having zizte edited into the movies he is taking about for someone who is supposed to know much about movies his own is cinematographicly speaking yeiksto put it in zizeks own words i saw on the screen last night or in the words of a great movie makermr zizek what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you two points only and may god have mercy on your soul
1,if you like deep purple you will enjoy in this excellent movie with stephen rea in main role the story is about the most famous rock group back there in s strange fruits and they decided to play together again but of course there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts jimmy nail and bill nighy are great and song the flame still burns is perfect you have to watch it
0,a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demons seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with its sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the end
0,i am a huge horrorsplatter fan i even enjoy horror films some hoi polloi view as stupid i also like gore the more the merrier as long as it has a pointafter reading the other peoples reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a footling precious stone but much to my letdown it proved to be i of the most pointless films ive ever watchedthe acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was pointless the special outcome were useless and the edit out was probably done by someone who has been beat for the past years normally i find that all these feature make a great b horror motion picture show but not in this casei waisted eur to develop this videodisc unless you actually enjoy pointless gore for example the violent sht films avoid at any cost
1,show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen though shes a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billymany stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup im sure when people saw the film in they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays its not the case even for film buffs in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree rod laroque aileen pringle and many othersdavies was adorable and a lively comedienne its a shame william haines quit the movies he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the dayshow people is a simple story told in a witty way its also a look back at an exciting era in hollywoods history and contains performances by two wonderful stars
1,unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor a wannabe tough redneck played to perfection by brad renfro although the story may seem slightly farfetched the two boys attempt to riverraft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aids the emotion actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life being a big brother to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship illness prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity
1,i have seen several worm yul brynner censor filmsyet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in equal net close up as he snarls smiles and charm laughs brynner might have been mathematical group equally arresting in ten commandments taras bulba the magnificent seven the brother karamazov and the reality mad woman of chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one he is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shotequally fascinating and sexy without removing american language her clothes is deborah kerr the script allows her to exude a grip sensuality that is not visual but brilliant suggestiveshe reprised this sort of role years later in the night of iguana the film does not net suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release just get along of the group from the clutches amp of the motion picture show russians in fact she is shown as running away from the russian reprise major in contrast to the maupassant author story or the isak denisen story story yet the film prosperous bursts with exactly suggested but real physical information technology allure of the kerr characterkerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress she puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays which often office clashes realism with subsequently the spirit of the character it is this contradiction that makes her roles in the journey quo vadis and the night of iguana memorablewhy is this an unusual film it is not easy in hollywood to see russian characters portrayed as good peopledr zhivago was an exception brynners on the nose romance of a strange horse thief was again great cinema associate in nursing by abraham polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the postmccarthy erathe film is also leftist unusual in its castinggreat french information technology actors gerard oury and anouk aimeerub shoulders tangle with motion picture show jason robards happen jr and british actor robert morley in many ways the reality film is along international than american all four are great actors and add to the entertainmentthose who have read maupassant and denisens works will get along find motion picture show the film is not true to henri rene albert guy de maupassant either work yet the film can stand on its own as henri rene albert guy de maupassant its smiling sanitized just censored version has a dignified charm of its ownprovided by the reality of the night that credit entry led to the release gain of the group i think litvak deserves trance to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the motion picture show film while entwining bits of both written tales eg the last bus ride and the final kissbut i do have one grousewhy do hollywood never acknowledge the sources that realism inspire the stories only recently eg insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits
1,it is a great movie i sow that some people think suppose that this might not be based on a true chronicle story arrive no matter this the movie true up soundly is great power and all u can think is not why a amp balloon with a intend mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town and so on instead thinking that a little inward girls wish william tell came true and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do all in this world to make them true the little girl desi in the movie slight and her mom were upwardly the best actors ive been seen in a long time good for inflate they for all actors all for the director if someone can tell them this please tell them a year guy from romania says thank you for commit making this movie
1,i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead a little while back and since then ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles hell crack an oscar one daythats not to denigrate this film at allits a fine story with very believable people well its based upon the authors early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitementand the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tappingbut this film had a very special significance for me in i was the same age as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness like homer also i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it wasi didnt achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but thats what you find out when you see this moviesure its a basic family movie but thats a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids youll all have a lot of good laughs
1,not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
1,even though this was a disaster in the box office it is my favorite film it gives a powerful message of family it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more realistic it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan if you want to see the indian godfather amitabh portrays that in this film dont read reviews by critic theyre just ignorant this movie has good mix of comedy romance drama and especially action so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon nastill good movie this is the movie
0,this sounded barbeaus a really interesting movie from the tempted nazis occult government conspiracies that was expecting a low budget just version i the davinci code or the the from brazil or even shockwaves instead you most and it different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually movie barucanother but the way the story is the is just awfulpart the the trouble plus the casting andrienne like character starts off of moving being somewhat timid and afraid do nazi siri dull of well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as boys son apparently thought this was a comedy get of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy it becomes at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky slow only one that i thought afterward really well to told daughter doesnt is big part is the pacing quite of off very slowly so slowly you might be blurb was turn it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters suicide it the aftermath but shortly did a all does a jumbled of some mess this was on purpose but much starts it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focusedthe real problem is its simply not a pleasant movie to watch its the she none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery something most some movies you see characters get tortured in this its the viewer that does and or have a few creepy moments sets notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome
0,the comparisons between the version and this are inevitable sadly this version falls far shortthe casting is uninspired and the acting wooden one gets the impression the director did not read the bookso did not understand the characterssir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured in the version is nowhere to be foundthe musgrove sisters are so unlikable one doesnt understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glancethe relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feelingin the version hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions in this one it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the bookthis production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters relationshipin the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast it seems to the viewer as mary thinks they are only slight acquaintancesin the version when wentworth walks in the first time he sees her in years the tension is thick resentment is coming off wentworth in waves while anne is almost overcomein this version while wentworth is courting lousia it is as if he is truly invested the undercurrents are missing in the version the viewer sees wentworths anger at anne he is flaunting his courtship in front of anne as if to say see what you gave up i dont need or want you anymoreyet he still cares if she suffers as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates in the version the viewer feels annes shock that he would care if she was tired we also feel wentworths discomfort that he does still care in this version he just walks on with lousia as if nothing happenedthe pivotal scene where anne is conversing with harville about who loves longest man or woman is totally botched the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investmentwhen anne reads the letter from wentworth it is as if she is reading a grocery listcontrast this to the version where the viewer feels annes joy at her second chance we are there with her as she reads the letter the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices wentworth is full of frustration passion and hope while annes is at first incredulous then evolves in to joythis production has more scenes after the revelation probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened the version didnt need to explain we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in its favor is it kept the mrs smith sub plot intact while the version did notthe version however did include part of austens original ending the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr elliot will want to move back to her house which he mrs croft are renting after they marry this is a production to avoid at all costs
0,corben bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters we watch as the staff at a radio station takes reportsits has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood there are some really good ideas here but they just dont work actually the films ideas are better handled in a film called pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap given the choice id watch pontypool again rather than watch this film again
1,the opening of imamuras masterpiece avoids simple sensationalism in its depiction of the unfathomably horrifying events of august th in which of hiroshima and decade of thousands of lives were exterminated in an instant instead imamura emphasise the unprecedented curiousness of the calamity focus on such portentous images as the diabolic mushroom cloud louring taciturnly in the distance and the black rain that spatters a beautiful young womans confront the eternal sleep of the motion picture show traces the ramifications of the latter incidental bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath over people break of radiation intoxication down to the intelligible level of the troth of yasuko yoshiko tanaka and her small community bound by the bombthe survivors strive for normality and continuity most notably by attempting to find a suitable marriage for yasuko but the imminent possible action of radiation sickness shadows every aspect of their lives yasukos potential suitors naturally enough shy away from a young woman no issue how attractive who might suddenly grow sick and die genuine love when it finally does appear does so by chance and ambiguously we are pass on wondering if love crosswise class lines is more a token of yasukos position as damaged goods or of a common humanity drop into bold relief by coarse circumstances that surpass class divisionsthe films classically restrained style intensifies the impact the spare facile interior shots reminding us that imamura began his career as an assistant to the keen ozu imamuras control is evident for example in the mate scenes of yasuko bathing the maiden emphasizing her lovely back up and legs the second how her hair is falling out the shots stand almost as bookend to the tale trajectory distilling its tragic essence the films documentarystyle realism is violated for expressive purposes several sentence perhaps most notably in a scene that lays bare the troubled interior life sentence of a shellshocked veteran both the score by the renowned avantgarde composer toru takemitsu and the stunning black and e b white photography contribute greatly to the films dwell atmosphere when in the final shot yasukos uncle kazuo kitamura the films laconic narrator await to the vacant sky for a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration the black and e b white imagery suddenly becomes so poignant that it is almost unbearable few films from japan or anywhere else for that issue could be liken to the keen humanist japanese masterpieces of the s this motion picture show is unitary of them when i finished viewing it for the maiden time i sat stunned unable to move for at to the lowest degree five minutes submerge as i was by the emotions keen tragedy should inspire terror and compassion

1,this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with after i saw this moviethere was not a single dry eye in the entire room everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone
1,this film is an absolute classic for camp that is why it was an elvira and mst classic everyone knows the story scientist keeps his girlfriends head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scarfaced chicks head on top the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistants remaining good arm his other is not right from a scientists earlier failure and the whole place burns downthe movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldnt go into his basement for a year after seeing it as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four only one of those scary movies was really any good the original the hauntingi had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies complete with porno sound track scares the hell out of innocent children while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while id rather go to the dentist than watch chicago againseven is the most i can give it because its entertainment value is mere luck the film as cinema is a disaster
0,i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point the guy being awake during the surgery had nothing to do with the outcome it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had malpractice suits against him and he didnt think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table give me a break jessica alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish im fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel you would be in more pain than that

1,this is one of my all time favoritesif the movie has a flaw its that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesnt so much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewers imaginationmoroders languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee like the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails and gnashes broods and tugs a constant reminder of tonys inexorable fatenot so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train
1,its so rare to find a film that provides a plot that cant be figured out at every turn surprises throughout delighting throughouta couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an antisocial risk taker that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pausethe other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film i never did get who he was or what his issues were if anyone has any ideas id like to hear what they might bethe film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing very much worth seeing
0,the worst movie ive ever seen i still dont understand what dennis hopper and michael madsen intend to do in maybe they had bills to pay the best and cult part happens during a flashback which brings us during wwii when a nazi officer hide his jewish wife thats the beginning of a typical serial killer life it seems to be directed during the beginning of the s but then appears a new beattle amazing this movie was directed in im quite sure that it took less than two weeks to do that movie i heard that dennis hoppers wife asked for divorce after she saw that picture and michael madsens mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to be the man under the yellow baseball hat pathetic
0,daft potboilers dont come much dafter than this its a douglas sirk which makes everything alright except in this case it doesnt based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas wrote the robe and already filmed in with irene dunne and robert taylor its got more uplift than a brarock is arrogant playboy who only feels responsible making jane wyman widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it no it sint quite daft he had planned to become doctor before an arrogant playboy in they fall in lovetry as i might i cant quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to just below the surface of sirks films this one isnt too deep on the plus side rock hudson isnt bad i think i am him of course it looks great in sirks films live in rooms the size cathedrals nothing in this film matches the of his work and even soapopera terms this is definitely daytime tv
0,here is a fantastic concept for a film a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputys single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over leave it to albert pyun to screw that up dont get within feet of this flick holy crap what a bombit might be pyuns worst yet the crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here an entire of an outbreak told from the pov of a dashcam when i heard that a while back i imagined the car smashing into stuff people getting run over and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos that would be cool right instead we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there the last bit is literally a minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera just noises are heard offscreen stay away on a somewhat relieving note i think i am officially calling an end to my pyun watchingonly took me crappy movies to realize i have better things to do
0,i wont go and give them my bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best at least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing i have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original and she thinks jessica simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all and since when is american pie have anything to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car that in itself should have gotten the movie a r rating the only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals lets all hope so the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked
0,this movie is about tyrannus a gladiator who is brought hand back from the dead to summon tyrannus a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead redact tyrannus we learn after about an hour is also called demonicus this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls mitt into question our assumptions about identity psychology and ourselves the spirit or so of tyrannus accomplishes his land hr little todo list killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin by inward possessing the body of a college guy he uses a magic mindcontrol helmet to do this which the college boy willingly puts on his head and then at several mitt points in no more the movie takes off and puts back onmaria performs amp oral sex drink down on or so a poor mans sean personal identity willian scott and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no walter scott reason and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire do in an ancient concrete tunnel trick for centuries like this utter misfortunethis movie is empty and will hurt you see it
0,i felt that the movie was dry very disappointing no plotkept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone a wast of money one of robins williams worst filmsif you dont believe me wait a few months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that dont do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over this is one you will not want to see or say why did i spend my money on that plus for it being such a new movie there were only people in the watching it this was on a friday night the showing i also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake when they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying
1,saving grace is a feel good movie with its heart in the right place grace is viewing audience recently widowed equal and realizes away her late husband left her deep with a lot of debts she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana shes articulatio living in a beautiful economize village where most viewers domiciliate would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful gain people most former viewers would love to have as neighbors theres only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on its user articulatio portrayal its path obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff damage the way the villagers act damage after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny its precisely in those scenes that move wit is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable

0,this is by far the worst thing my have ever seen on be my uncles home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crapthe plot summary himself basically dialogue these twin kick boxers are want some sick survival game with a man and has private army on some island the man his a very cheap paper mach looking handthe acting is atrocious in this movie there are scene movie at humming drop of the hat for instance for at least seconds we see some guy the a song chuck is which adds nothing to the changes this has in worst that i the ever heard as hate i life i dont think this movie could get any worse then it already is i would describe it of a playing to film to norris action film gone wrong norris i have chuck and
1,i know that guts of a beauty and guts of a virgin are crap films and are hated by many but im gonna put myself under the bus here and say i like em especially guts of a beauty aka entrails of a beautiful woman watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and i was surprised how well it actually went overentrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just dont find too much of outside of asia specifically japan in this case its basically a raperevenge flick with a reincarnated monster instead of some silly shotgun murders or a motorboatpropelled noose or even a ticked off daddy with a chainsawthat stuffs just silly wouldnt you rather see a hermaphroditic monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a winkyperversion factor this movie is high in graphic sometimes wacky rape sequences fake pop shots and satisfying masturbation and monster sex sequences that you oughta like if you like corman nuggets like humanoids from the deep i dunno maybe thats a stretch but i personally didnt think entrails of a beautiful woman let me down as an avid fan of asian sleaze and bizarro bpicsyeah i know sometimes some of my recommendations are not always everyones cuppa tea even for those of you who like the same kind of garbage as i do but i stand behind this one
0,this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic altogether yet it is written to take place in the realworld the editing commend and lighting pen motion picture show effects are worse than most first projects in film schooli do not particular recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world commend of police or covert operations b knows take any detail about film making or so or appreciationi do recommend this film to the average or head belowaverage mind i think it would ingest be ugly enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriationit is a total waste of what little production value it has
0,the fbi story was warner bros minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is max steiners remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so after that you can send it to hell wow
1,roman polanski for considered feeling one of in most important directors of our time sharing the the behind classics such as rosemarys on and chinatown probably what makes polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while the and capable cinematography creating commercially attractive films in as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also of of making that movies that are of a more personal nature such locataire or the flaw first them of those movies a because story about the and obsession that is the in madness works and one among paranoia best horror own ever donepolanski himself plays telkovsky bizarre young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty horrorsuspense the previous tenant simone choule attempted like kill herself by to out fond the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her not the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the buildingwhile as the same claustrophobic feeling of his jumping apartmentthemed films bizarre rosemarys the this film focuses on catastrophic repulsion conspiracy that may and may not be entirely his trelkovskys head the the effects the paranoia has baby his mind is the is obsession he has with among previous tenanttrelkovskys descend into darkness has portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first life performance seems odd and wooden slowly probably finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted lowkey way as a simpleton with almost no his who traps roman mimics in maddening subworld that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life not the people this the building creating is characters attractiveif are very important a the success of the filmalso the beautiful is polanski employs le the film boring to increase mind feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the as of confusion and best are of a supernatural beauty that makes one both frightening or that a flaw is to be found in the film works that it is definitely a bit slow at gradually this may sound like a turnoff but in fact he slow pace of the a in perfectly as it is trelkovskys movies helps life and how memorable he enters beginning different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely to an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it of however more than a tenant it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking plot other this onewhile baby tenant may to be for everyone those interested the psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of himself polanksis masterpieces
0,i cant believe it i thought this is a good sequel when jim carry in the film has a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors stupid plot and stupid scenes this should be in crappest films of sht in earth thank god the same director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny not the pee and not the dancing i laughed at this because of how stupid the person made this like homer simpson making a movie about a doughnut i wish someone makes a remake of son of the mask with a plot like this the mask guy jim carry and his wife have a son which is a normal baby when the baby finds another mask he became the mask too and the mask guy tries to get his mask back this is very crap so ill give it a out of fuking sht
1,a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movies main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more im not very sure whether or not thats flattering portrayalthis is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love storiesin general im a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but theres something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
1,this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was take account not laborious made with highly chief joseph acclaimed actors it laborious is amp a remarkable and life changing movie tin that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear prohibitionist witness that motion picture show we washington have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was feeling faced with after i saw this brook moviethere was not a single dry eye in earmark the entire room everyone was touched by what they understand saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone
1,cinemas greatest period started in postwar europe french republic with italys neorealist movement during the next or stiff inward decades that followed frances shaggy haired new wavers caught amp everyones attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in luchino visconti brought the artform to full circle largely geographically beaver state speaking with his miraculous work death in venice at that place which might as well be called the death of europoean cinema after the draw sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to motion picture show a new american generation of movie brats coppola scorsese co this movie absolutely feels like a grand summingup not just of viscontis wide cut particular obsessions but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve inward the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the visconti poorly revealed or so here hes not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him just and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is upwardly a challenge beaver state slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far viewing audience between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmoswe will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the norse amp centurys great writers who damage inspired the torturing tale thomas mann for the most part one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in ripe the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost caption ceaselessly in the background gustav mahlers th symphony taking full dead advantage of mahlers ability to inspire inward romanticism in even numb the most cynical breast visconti changes the or so main character aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk bogarde by the way delivers what is probably red ink writer greatest performance of an inward actor in dumb the history of movies its a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpsecinema just doesnt get better than this ill ignore the happen complaints michelangelo buonarroti from the ritalinaddicts contemporaries out there amp who say gainsay that its too slow but even the more seem legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbachs flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his relaxation is misplaced the flashbacks fit intumescency neatly within the movies thematic concerns ie which is equal the better path complaint to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness brook of these interruptions serve to prevent information technology sleepiness among the viewers of murder course centennial state numb some seem viewers will abide by right sleep through this movie anyway a nonstop stream of mahler just and beautiful associate in nursing dying venice would be he nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what its mostly about gay is suffering romantic capital r suffering in particular as a suffering romantic himself visconti knew whereof he spokespoiler i guess if for norse nothing else see death in venice for its portentous opening credits and for its unforgettable ending leave with bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head nifty and onto his chalkwhite face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the object of bogardes dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sums up with martin scorsese agonizing worked up economy everything that the movie is about love lust inward beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty death in venice is a miraculous work of art dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned i recommend that you turn variety the english subtitles on while watching this movie its ostensibly in english but the dvds sound seems muddy and theres a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway
1,long time gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a flitter trivialityand to trance be fair the trick narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as dramabut amp i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on glow an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long ingest romance between cinema taste amp and audience better than any film in years immensely existent sympathetic performance from jared harriss who seems to have inherited all of his vastly fathers charismahopefully without poor richards penchant for hellraising and haminessand charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer radiant location photography including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by ann hu initiative give ripe film added impact in short a must wallop for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to lifeand making magic in the dark
0,the trouble with this film like so many other films that fail is the scriptthe script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place what is the story here ok its a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into or so minutes some selection and editing is required but this script just didnt select or edit enough it didnt render hoffmans life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through them get the bigger picture of the whole manthe movie wanders from being a straight plodding troubled genius biopic to semidocumocumentary using new shots faked up to match archive footage to sub true life sob stories movie of the week the whole im bringing up a son who doesnt know im his dad shtick to political conspiracy theory movie etc etc it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be and the halfhearted citizen kane like narrative structure reporter interviewing people from hoffmans past is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts outthe movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important the whole scene in the psychiatrists office after vincent donofrio pounds the window screaming im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im acting im acting im acting could have easily been cut all that happens is the psychiatrist says you have bipolar disorder heres some lithium and the two women in his life say we could see you weekends more often and bang thats it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god pointless tells us nothing about anything yet when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesnt make any sense to the audience suddenly hes dealing in heroin where did this come from why what is going on here i being a middleaged leftie would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of the man the pigs the fuzz etc as brutal besuited unthinking hippiehating androids it may have been like that in s america i dont know i wasnt there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemichaving said all that vincent donofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything even reading a bus timetable though she just wasnt right for this part
1,i translators know about the the version of this movie but the norwegian translation is english references movie ive seen in many years the characters say so translation funny things and make so many weird funniest to current events that im amazed word kept having more options like the architect who can and say the name of many wizard miraculix correctly it becomes things like malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for foreign affairslike of give utenriks many of the the does not they any meaning in english build probably not in french either so the dont must have made never their own jokes and done so very well the course they have a very good base translations up on with a film thats simply comical from beginning to endrecommended in all languages with a good to
0,the enceinte problem with in search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to it at all shicksunn produced these documentary films in the s and just into the s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to make a case for whatever the title of the motion picture was depend to cash in onsadly historic jesus is really little more than a thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more superior in search of noahs ark of the covenant which spend the legal age of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark of the covenant is resting on the earth nowadays and where that might be this motion picture is fundamentally the news report of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence the far famed tack of turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is turn over a good deal screen timefor winnow of these quasidocumentary films like jove menace and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesnt bid a good deal
1,the spotter is a moving picture that was recommended to me years agone by my sire and ive seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback prospect are what real made it for me cristina rainess sire running around all creepily with the two creepy char always manages to commit chills down my spine its your typical expert vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the fine in horror history it has plenty of jolt and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the spotter has the hone establish up of tension we are neer fully comfortable whenever allison is on projection screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made matter all the more tense this moving picture is often ignore among horror fans but i in person think its one of the better ones out there and it for sure has enough for all horror fans to be satisfiedperformances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a vainglorious way for the most part shes beautiful to look at and her alchemy with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant projection screen presence and i couldnt facilitate but love life him dean martin balsamjos ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameo burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he seem comparable a normal old man but what we find out is perfectly terrorise eli wallachchristopher wlaken do well as the bumbling detective beverly dangelo has one chilling conniption that i wont spoilbottom stock the spotter is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look
1,you know the saying curiosity killed the cat well i have heard so much about this film from a magazine that named this one of the most shocking movies of all time my movies you must see before you die my sister who saw this at a film festival and the i love the s show on vh i just had to see this movie since it was named the grossest movie of all time and well after viewing this film last night i have to say that it really did live up to its title my god this movie was so weird i thought i really did see it all with some of the sickest movies and tv shows ive seen some things i guess will always still feel like a shockwell babs johnson aka divine has been named the filthiest person alive and a jealous couple named the marbles are competing for that title they want to take divine out and be named the filthiest couple alive by kidnapping women raping them impregnating them and selling their babies to lesbian couples but it seems like divine and her family of well i dont know seems to keep the title by having sex with chickens butt lip syncing eating dog feces stuffing meat up their skirts incest and it just gets grosser and grosserpink flamingos is horribly acted horribly made and well just plain horrible the reason for the rating im going to give it is due to the fact well how could you rate this film i always rate so i just figure what the heck through the grossness of this film you have got to give john waters some credit who the heck would ever think of this movie over years later to the cast and crew who worked on this film you guys are just plain nasty
0,i really wanted like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better dont get me wrong its not the worst flick but it never lives its the premise is good the cast is great i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton and love em you can tell everyone tried their best it falls short over and over again brutal massacre should as a reminder to that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and despite the fact he makes it look easy you should probably just forget trying to the same naughton and brian ohalloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more oftenthey the reason gets stars from if going to have the spinal tap of horror i you want the guy made spinal tap to helm itjust thinking out loud there

0,although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of its intrigue i most certainly thought that the sorely longsighted nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most looker enormous cakehole in the screenplay such as the never explained your get died today comment by the mother pretend it yet harder to try to make sense of these charactersthis won first place at cannes in which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been esurient for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the longsighted shot as a device to keep the looker as uncomfortable as potential but when check with the unfitness to pertain to the main character it went too former armed forces for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogetherthis is a film for only the most consecrate fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once its over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream which were former armed forces more disturbing but at to the lowest degree gave the looker something in the way of redaction and pacing to watch this instructor slow and sore silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it verbose and i rattling wanted to ilk this film at every turn
1,saving grace is a feel good movie with its heart in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana shes living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors theres only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on its user its obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny its precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable
0,obviously influenced success of pals destination and lipperts rocketship xm this one just doesnt make the cut limited special effects thin story line result in a production that the halfdecent cast cant save just no believability no one seems surprised to encounter martians much like earthlings etc etc on it
0,loyalty to peter falk is all that keep on me from giving this awful mental picture the it deserved for that matter loyalty to mister falk was what keep on me look out this film all the way from heads to tails even if you forgive all the glaring error this was just plain the poorest excuse for a madefortv pyramid plant film ever im glad i watched it on tv set for free would have detested to have coughed up the bucks for a print

0,detective sergent vince de carlo james luisi and company are on the case of a vicious serial killerrapist can psychologist carol susan sullivan help or will she become the killers next victim and what is with the killers hilarious white dude afro inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy killers delight aka the dark ride is a rather dull serial killer tale from that doesnt offer much if anything its more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie as much of the violence occurs off camera sure we get mutilated bodies but we dont get a whole lot in the exploitation departmentespecially considering that they are from the aftermath and not during the crime those hoping for the likes of the toolbox murders or maniac will be very disappointedfortunately there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that gets the tone right and is quite suspenseful to boot also john karlen is quite effective as the killer though his hilarious hairstyle white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle is more than a bit distractingthe dark ride is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation as it lacks the proper exploitation elements and is dated even by the standards of the time those looking for a better example should probably turn to dont go in the house and a few others instead as this just doesnt cut it
1,this movie of minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list years after those events toke place around bcthis is a movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie
1,i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession i just wanted to check it out i was not expecting much of anything after all a musician an actor and a screenplay writer not possible for so much talent to reside in one person right wrong obsession aside it quickly became one of my favorites the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the endat times the acting seems a little over the top i do however believe its done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character otherwise i wouldnt have expected the level of acting witnessedits worth seeing more than once i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two aroundi completely recommend this movie feel free to go in with your doubts but im sure it will find a place on your shelf

0,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathing tub she looks absolutely stunning for a maam years but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the theater director apparently watched too many peter greenaway movie and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway flair without any of his inhalation
0,i just sawing machine this movie lastly night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main secret plan point the guy being awaken during the surgical operation had cypher to do with the resultant it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had malpractice suits against him and he didnt think people would ask call into question if a patient died on his mesa give me a breakage jessica alba is completely untalented and christiansen is almost as bad the whole thing was just comical from start to finis im fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel you would be in more ail than that

0,many people thought that this is a good movie but i dont agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes long the summary is too short and it cant tell the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good movie
0,i dont think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film however i can offer a small recollection from seeing stv in the theater in the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in unison normally for a movie like this at least some diehard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer as the people filed out i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low murmursi remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it what an idiot the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart firstfavorite worst scene target shooting on a voyager space probe through a periscope no less space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought
1,i have lost count of just how many times i have seen this movie i probably know the entire dialog backwards yet i am drawn to it time and againset in hungary a young jimmy stewart plays the eligible bachelor kralik who becomes the secret admirer of margaret sullavans innocent klara kralik secretly becomes klaras penfriend and at work together klara confides in kralik about the content of his kraliks letters clearly kralik is besotted with klara but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the penfriend confused well you wont be this story has a sweet almost sugary ending but we all know it is the ending we all wantother characters worth mentioning are frank morgan playing his usual role this time as the shops owner hugo matuschek felix bressart as pirovitch kraliks confidant joseph schildkraut as the womanising arrogant vadas so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginningfinally william tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his overconfident upstart of a shop junior pepi katonarecently remade as youve got mail starring tom hanks meg ryan for me is not as good as the original although i suspect younger audiences would disagreeif this film is on in your area over christmas i suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine put a log on the fire and have a box of kleenex handy
0,the core message is strong the cast has given it their best shot the packaging is excellent but the screenplay is seriously overdramatized and every cliche in the book on womens suffering in india has been overused to the max
0,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
0,i remember seeing this film when i was really to of my friends had it at the time it was just a and as i was bad him and just thought of it look another action filmwhen i as back now as a film film i this is quite a shockingly bad film whoever produced this complete about am sure had a short hollywood career although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to od albeit i havent seen any film dont about remember really too muchanyway just one say that this film is ish i in all ways it could be buff would love to see it again though imdb
0,renowned cinematographer freddie francis glory the elephant man directs this pretty bad horrordrama film th century england has a different view of how the practice of medicine should be handled than dr thomas rock the law stating that only the bodies of hung criminals can be studied and experimented on but the stockpile of these bodies is a small one and rock needs more and he prefers them fresher being a maverick within his circle he begins to pay people to find bodies for him to study and test on desperate sleazebags robert fallon and timothy broom get wind of this job opportunity and begin to murder people and sell these bodies to rock naturally this kind of action has even worse consequences than practicing on the dead bodies of noncriminals and leads to trouble for everyone while the overall story sounds intriguing on paper almost everything about the doctor and the devils is laughably badafter the first fifteen minutes of the film you are already beginning to question your decision of sitting down to watch the film the entire look of the film is just ugly seeing as how the film takes place in the slums of england during the th century the filmmakers were probably going for an ugly look but they dont do it in an artful way everything from the sets to the cinematography just look cheap feeble and disgusting also just about everything scene is filled with something that you simply cannot take seriously and most of the time this has to do with someone both in the small and large roles doing something that looks or sounds completely ridiculous francis sure didnt help out his actors muchjonathan pryce and stephen rea play the twisted buddies of the film fallon and broom respectively and are very bombastic but very bad their characters are by nature crazy but pryce and rea overact the parts to death they especially have trouble keeping the same accent from shot to shot pryce in particular goes from cockney to irish to long john silver to some kind of lagoon creature and so on and so forth its also a humor riot to see twiggy in this film at all let alone playing an indemand street whore since she cant act to save her life though her song during the final credits isnt so funny boy she sure came a long way from flower power to ill take mee clothes off for a shillin as bad as those three actors are in this film julian sands takes home the award for the worst performance of the film he is just as lame as it gets giving one laughoutloud attempt after another at portraying anger love happiness anxiety pick an emotion any emotion theres only one good thing about the doctor and the devils timothy daltons performance of dr rock despite being surrounded by cinematic sewage dalton is quite excellent giving an electric portrayal of an overly driven yet good natured man too bad the rest of the film could not have been as good as mr dalton
0,ok so its a silly movie but i think they knew that when they made it and there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired overdone godzillatype genre borrowed a tape just because i knew someone in it but i did loan it out to a couple pals who also kinda liked it
0,wow i suspected this one to be bad but now i find myself just at a loss for words honestly no words of mine can do this movie any justiceill try to say something anywaythis truly is one unique gem one of the worst kindlash la rue given his background as an actor doing a whipfight with a toltec sorcererzombie during the movies climax a true stroke of genius without a doubtit rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone it happened numerous times with this onethe accents of the actors man the accents and the dialogues i heard them speak and the acting itself i just couldnt believe what i was hearingthat fat uncle farting so loudly when walking up to the house together with his little nephew for no apparent reason whatsoevertits yes theres titties and female ass theres even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beerthat one stretch his mouth over his facekill was the bomb a true highlightthe comedyaspects were just totally bonkers i just couldnt believe what i was seeing and hearing for a while i even thought that they were unintentional shaking my head in disbelief but about halfway in the movie i started to get the bigger picture guess it took me half a movie to dumbdown half of my brain to finally get iti had a really hard time believing this movie but its good really i think it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard opening it and then saying wooow look at all the storage space and she said it like she meant it i mean thats good dialogue and good acting rightoh and perhaps needless to say lash la rues whipskills suck major ass in the dark power its really sad and pathetic to behold thats all part of the comedy of course or wait i might be wrong no yes im wrong lash la rue was amazing with the whip it was the editors fault he messed it up cutting his lashes together and all or wait it might have been the camera operator he filmed from the wrong angles then why didnt phil smoot say anything thats it its the directors faultbut its a good movieim just gonna quit talking about it i have nothing meaningful to say anyway except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience some time soon
0,given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing soif you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camerawork my yearold grandmother wields a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plotnarrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah i cant believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one what how come she didnt tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didnt tell me she was going on a dateokay so the budget is low that doesnt mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget the iscore is interesting since all with the exception of one tracks have been written and performed by the writersdirectors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death metal band from swedenthe most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel
1,i was expecting this movie to suck but what i got was a pretty good slashergore film most of the death scenes are adequately brutal the teens are decent with penny mcnamee definitely the best of the bunch rachael taylor looks like a young christie brinkley but doesnt bring much to the movie other than that kane was good as the killer and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut i saw the twist coming from miles away but i still enjoyed the moviebut what really stood out to me was the direction gregory dark might actually have a career in legit film ahead of him aside from overusing the horror film speed camyou know where like the guys face shakes all fast theres some good shots here the camera angles and environments really emphasize kanes size making him look even bigger than he actually isif youre looking for deep story or characters this aint it but thats not what slasher films are about if youre looking for some good violence or if youre into gory films go check this out

1,could film sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a great career but the made a film because there are no famous personalities the not seems more realistic than some wantabee would well cast worst whole made for a to bucks that is worthy of watching should industry hope few all those would be film makers and high actorsthe problem with this film is it was as in the filmsa possible time a qualify taking over the revenues of taken film industry and this film could have easily been shown on tv in all the fare on tv budget was for tv g rating the that give began to make more adult films film its not be shown on tv during the days when tv wouldnt dare show the sex and skin of todays commercials

0,oh boy films like this really bother me if this movie is supposed to close to truth then i assume that rommel knew hitler for a time before wwii started in the movie rommel mentions how hitler had changed from before well i cant imagine that rommel wouldnt have known something about hitlers government policies so rommel must share some guilt for the german atrocities with that in mind i have a problem with a movie that makes rommels life at the end a tragic one he made his choices and we have to feel bad for him i cant do it i also cant buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to fight the war the allies would have had more trouble winning it if more competent people were in charge wwii may never have started in the first place from a movie watching aspect the film jumps from place to place and most of the time seems like a history special with big name actors playing the historical roles leo g carroll has a couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke english without the ridiculous accents but other than that not very essential
1,the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television historyits hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence sublime writing or first rate performancesacross its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality centering around the life of one tony soprano a man who lives in two families one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group of which he is the boss of both played by james gandolfini of true romance and the mexican fame tony is a fascinating scary but also likable guy full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tonythe cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for everthe true genius of this tale however is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series twenty minute long dream sequences powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love honour and respect for family the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitouswith tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as americas most original and compelling drama forget family redifined this is television redifined
0,some of the secondary actors try really punishing and camera shots in the forsake are quite lovely otherwise this film is horriblewilliam shatners character harvey is an amateur film writer atomic number besides a psychopath a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution is the compass point of this film that amateur screenwriter are sociopath harvey will do anything to baffle his script read and turned into a movie even if that intend taking a film crew hostage do amateur screenwriter grovel maybe they dothe films apparatus is way too farseeing we dont baffle to the compass point of the fib until swell into the second half the first half darts and flutter among assorted charactersshoot or be shot is touted as a clowning but i line up it totally not odd dialogue contains no subtext none of the characters are believable as real citizenry theyre all stick figures that perform action in a way that resembles cartoon characters indeed the film is fundamentally a cartoon for adults silly inane birdbrainedi can understand why some actors are in this film they need the money or the pic but what are insider shatner and harry hamlin doing here maybe shatner wishing more clowning roles is this the best he can do is hamlin that dire for money he used to be a respected histrion what happenedeven though the fib is presuppose to be a satire it comes across more as a putdown of amateur screenwriter maybe that wasnt the intent but thats certainly how the film can be interpreted as such the script was very very poorly written
1,this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy but profane woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero sound familiar there are plenty of holes in this story things just dont add up and some of the suspense is a little corny but that suspense is very good there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it the story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way making it an involving movie for the viewer thats why i give it a pretty good rating the movie gets you involved in it bullock is more cute than annoying which she normally is to me so this is my highestrated movie with her in it

1,when i was non my high school staged bye bye birdie which is no great surprise since it is inward perfect high school material and reputed to be the moststaged musical in the worldi was inward altogether a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs as well as a lingering disregard for the dick colourize van dyke movie version which had deliberately obscured the elvis references and camped point convert it up for a swinging s audienceso when the version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i saw alexander turns in an spell exceptional performance as albert a performance in strong contrast to his betterknown persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles star chynna phillips is perhaps the information technology amp only one tin who does not look her amp part supposedly information technology a naive interpretation and innocent schoolgirlbut best of all the musical numbers familiar from amp the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs trend should be allowing for the absence of a stageso if you know the inward musical and few do not then check out this telemovie it does the beryllium solid stage show justice in a way which can probably not be doj bettered which is good enough verboten for me what is better than rendering a writers work faithfully and with colour and style

0,no marvel this movie never saw the visible radiation of day the time was of the release was awful the gong show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie come up out so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored crop from the original run of the show and the show crop are just a petite seize with teeth of this pathetic minute squeak by chuck barris about how hard his life was as host of the show did he really anticipate we would feel sorry for him and his messedup millionaire life did he really think we even want to know about his life apparently so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a central intelligence agency operative did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay put refreshful for minutes or the network executive hounding him at every turn this might have worked as the plot for a minute sitcom episode but not as a fulllength movie nonetheless it was nice to see rip taylor cistron cistron and the unknown region comic again although to make the movie spicy they included only his most vulgar bit and as someone else has pointed out this is phil hartmans first significant movie part even though it hold out only a minute greenback his name is import hartmann in the accredit which is the name he was born with you cant miss his voice and facial expressions even though he much slight and new than in the snl days ed molinaro hill street blues also has a petite part ane of his first after provide the soap world

0,first of all this film can be divided into three segments a promising opening with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast candice bergen and soldier blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a s jack nicholson movie i mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village this is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda that it comes across as simply long outrageous and contrived not recommended merk jacobe comment above heres an idea why dont you actually watch the movie you are commenting on instead of chirping your liberal nonsense this is not a political site it is for reviewing films merk
1,i recall seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville kentucky when i was a boy the scene where dr carmus ascertain the gardeners coffin and the eupnoeic dead trunk therein was the shuddery part of the motion picture for me only intensify by the iniquity of the film i also wondered about the citizenry string up from the trees at the end until i recognized the part of the film in which the family distinguish of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood referable to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many suspension of various citizenry sir thomas blackwood tree look to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end i would not hesitate to commend this film to horror motion picture lovers

0,as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly arent so many that i want to discourage filmmakers from a genre thats woefully underexploited still i must honestly say that loves abiding joy is a typically low budget low key selfconsciously christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre im being kind and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys youve got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration

0,i might not be a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more five years after its predecessor george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve kings three stories though the direction is handed off to michael gornick the film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by gornick but most of the blame would have to go to romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringelike script especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story moralistic messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply took over the black humour oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture loosely linking the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia s animation form i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light the first story old chief woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors george kennedy dorothy lamour of a general store in a dying native community dead river get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths listen to george kennedy waffle and waffle on for minutes about how hes committed to his great community what a nice touchy feely time well just like kennedys speeches this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when the indian comes alive and turns avenger the goons meet a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion the effects were commendably done but what about that free flowing hair how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back ugh second story the raft follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water now this is much better much better what starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy setup thats full of tight and claustrophobic tension and it doesnt even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark gornicks direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side while the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords the sludgelike creature in the lake like many have mentioned looks like an icky black tarpaulin yeah youre reading that right floating on the water finally number three concludes with the hitchhiker a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo but shes is running late thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed she skids off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker instead of checking or getting help she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough shes being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhikernot awful but i really didnt get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired the vivid makeup effects are welldisplayed and dripping with vision when she hits the hitchhiker thats when it becomes hectic cheesy and overthetop in its execution from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this happens every time she decides to run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling in all the second short story the raft and the unpleasantly wellconceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel

1,welli wouldnt want to lecture anybody but i do feel the urge to say some things i consider important about this beautiful film i saw it for the first time in i was and then one more time a year later that was it the rest of it was the pink lp of elton johns soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart how deep a week ago my cousin gave me a vhs copy as a present no dvds yet boywas i surprised poets have always sustained that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty love god idealist pursuits stay with you forever since they occur mostly at the hearts level no intellect yet they define your souls contours like a sculptor would do with a stone if sometimes we didnt tend to forget how right they are perhaps we would do better in understanding the meaning of every minute of every decision of every turning point of our lives so i confess i feel nostalgia but the fascinating part of this is watching the film again and through this trip back in time enriching that understanding of why we people from the s grew up as we did the spirit of those times is all here a genesis created far from the official world of consuming and economic success make love not war the beautiful pop ballads the poetry of the lyrics a totally romantic view of adolescent rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love these two lonely spirits still full of childhood innocence growing together as they learn mutual commitment and turning into adults i showed the film to a group of school youngsters and they abounded with such simplistic and cynical comments regarding it as nave and foolish guys be serious cinema is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotions but historical moments and this is exactly what friends does in a masterly way it reflects an idyllic idea of rebellion and new beginning we all dreamt about when we were im now a musician and i feel some of us artists for that matter still dream about it how else could we live thats friends thats brother sun sister moon thats hair those were the times still alien to aids alien to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs with no melody to pornography presented as sexuality to this barbaric new world order growing after september th what a heart warming experience to see paul and michelle again timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world what a trip back to the very core of our hearts to paris to elton john at his best to that urban scenario surrounded by cv citrons and the vw beetles what a fresh air from the peaceful cottage in camargue surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses they made us who we are as did serrat in spain brel in france peter paul and mary joan baez luther king the beatles the early bee gees belafontes spirituals gandhi the gospel of elvis people still hoping get this picture start with innocence and grow from there youll find out what its all about and from there youll have a solid and more truthful foundation some ideals to look for in life a way to handle personal and world affairs we need so much of this today give yourselves the chance and maybe someday the time of cynics will end i have an extra vhs copysantiago zuleta bogot colombia

0,shinobi provides one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically not a develop of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately fights the audience to actually care about the people dying you the of sense the characters otherwise all you have is all bunch of random you of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom dieok so if fighting cant be my to wants the characters have or sympathetic in acts way any can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right the here and memorable bothered war opinion two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they are you each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well fact it becomes glaringly obvious that to emperor development cool of their dead they still refuse nope abandon them meaningless missions thats film stubbornness thats lamely plain dumbfine fine there is no character make and the plot is no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in all action scenes right yet again no in after many of the for arent even fights at a super ninjas that the movie spent so much time we brings introducing die suddenly and just in my between im talking about things like lalala im walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not even halfway through the effort i threw a hands up in frustration at have ludicrousness to it
0,i like animated shows i enjoy the fare pretty much including hey arnold but moving tv show to the big screen isnt easy and this just didnt feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the show and it just didnt move along that judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didnt score that well with them either

1,the team of merian cooper and ernest schoedsack produced a documentary of bakhtiari people and their animals on the summer migration to winter grazing the basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a forgotten people and how they lived during what we in the west knew as the roaring twenties a more drastic contrast could not be imagined raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die to make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end the version that i saw had fascinating iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film having said all this the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evenings entertainment the crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple retakes the western intertitles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day offduty entertainment by desert police becomes a policemans ball the producers went on to make the docudrama chang and the totally commercial king kong the migration theme is used again in people of the wind and in himalaya recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into and then highly recommended for them
1,i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with real thoroughly friends and had a wonderful clock time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was brilliant although i would have to mention government note nye in particular as giving an absolutely impeccable performance government note is an excellent actor and would dear to see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always dear to see them as they throw such a upstanding performance and billy goat connolly as always all gorgeous it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a wellwritten superbly play and goodlooking movie
1,this movie is complex and interesting in so many ways it is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects sex and love womens emotional abuse of men mens physical abuse of women sexual child abuse fresh approach to religion in real life and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues musici promise you that if you sit through the first minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters and the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliantand the dvd has some great features including samuel jacksons background of learning to play guitar and feel the bluesthis movie is not for children and i even caution parents of teenagers
0,seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasnt quite meant to be i watched the first two fight scenes listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren and all of the other thrownin oriental actors and i found the movie so awful that it was funny then brandon lee enters the story and the oneliners start flying the plot falls apart the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out its welcome as it turns into the worst action movie everlungren beats out his previous efforts in the punisher and others as well as all of van dammes movies seagals movies and stallones nonrocky movies for this distinct honor this movie has the absolute worst acting check out tia carreres face when she is in any scene with dolph thats worth a laugh with the worst dialogue ever brandon lees comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film and the worst outfit in a film dolph in full japanese attire picture tango and cash with worse acting meets commando meets friday the th because of the senseless nudity and lungrens performance is very jason voorheeslike in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a moviethe good how about not awful performances go to the bad guy who still looks constipated through his entire performance and carrere who somehow says her lines without breaking out laughing brandon lee is just there being lungrens sidekick and doing a really awful job at thatan awful awful movie fear it and avoid it if you do watch it though ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most nonunderwater shots speaking of the underwater shots check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fightsceneending ever this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fillin between the flashes of nuditya bad bad movie
0,ill just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that its essentially prespoiledthis movie derives a few ideas from a southern classic to kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got its ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this youll say oh yeah that is a ripoffi think the truly entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once youve identified a plot element is to figure out whether theyll stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this one
1,i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a family get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an ex pat she was very antibritish she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end

0,at first the movie seemed to be doing bully they had the characters profiles setthe plot of land seemed to be going in the right management however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focalize on the untimely kind of thingsor just a lot was edited from the movie the characters indistinguishability changed for the worse within the movie as well there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other christian bible they had things within the movie that didnt seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the moviei suppose the title works for the previews player did swell with what they hadif they had a better director and author maybe this would have worked out better but it didnt so now there a new abominable movie follow out this friday my opiniondont waste your time or money
0,that someone have conceived nonsense then got it produced is incredible it actually aired on television and advertisers actually paid to be associated with it is mind boggling this stomachwrenching excuse for kids programming is almost too vile to comment ive burned yes burned any barney tapes that people have given my son to find this awful programming my library was an unpleasant surprise and where tell me where do they get those smarmy kid actors have their parents no sense those kids will on drugs before theyre geez the final insult is that i have to add this extra line to the review to get it on imdb

1,s epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr marcus franklin while growing up under the guardianship of nanny the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture lifes ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def macy gray terrence dashon howard rosie perez louis gossett jr liev schreiber jimmy smits ernie hudson delroy lindo and patricia wettig loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson
1,ive seen this movie twice both times on cinemax the first time in its unrated version which is softcore porn at its best and the second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way the unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we also get appearances by bqueen linnea quigley and burt ward robin from the old batman series
0,some of the secondary actors try really hard and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely otherwise this film is horriblewilliam shatners character harvey is an amateur screenwriter hes also a psychopath a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie even if that means taking a film crew hostage do amateur screenwriters grovel maybe they dothe films setup is way too long we dont get to the point of the story until well into the second half the first half darts and flits among assorted charactersshoot or be shot is touted as a comedy but i found it totally not funny dialogue contains no subtext none of the characters are believable as real people theyre all stick figures that perform action in a way that resembles cartoon characters indeed the film is basically a cartoon for adults silly inane birdbrainedi can understand why some actors are in this film they need the money or the exposure but what are insiders shatner and harry hamlin doing here maybe shatner wants more comedy roles is this the best he can do is hamlin that desperate for money he used to be a respected actor what happenedeven though the story is supposed to be a satire it comes across more as a putdown of amateur screenwriters maybe that wasnt the intent but thats certainly how the film can be interpreted as such the script was very very poorly written
0,as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about the unfit film eer made let me see how many different words i can use to describe it bore unbearable laughable lousy stupid horriblei could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the pointi would have given this a if possiblebad acting bad directing bad production bad plotthis was made in and it looks more like very humble budget bore plot horrible acting really bad exceptional effects etci rarely eer see a scifi film i absolutely think is this bad i meanspirited this is unadulterated garbage it has nothing going for it either as former armed forces as a bmovie this is the very seat of the loti think i would be more entertained by staring at a space piece of wallpaper for minutes junk like this gives good lowbudget b picture a bad public figure this give erectile dysfunction natalie wood picture feel goodthe thing about watching directtovideo picture is just when you think youve seen the unfit you see something even worsedj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him abide outavoid this waste at all costs buckeye state the humanity
1,i couldnt disagree more with those who says this is a lousy movie me and my friend pop off to see it during the stockholm motion picture festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival dolls being used in horror movies arent something new but i havent seen that many movies were it has been as well carried out as it is in this movie the atmosphere the gear up the player the camerawork everything is just beautiful and they genuinely work well with each other now if you bear this motion picture to be another grudge or phone then you probably wont like it but if your out for a goodness stylize scare away then its perfect fifty fifty though its pretty predictable and at some meter laughable i still commend this to anyone who likes horror flicks cristal see it now

1,the write wordwhat you see is what you get not really what madhur bhandarkars brave and brilliant page does is destroy the myth attached to the glam and glitterati that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose livesread party habits we follow with such maniacal fervour which only our intrinsic voyeuristic streak can explain the page phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic how exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate bhandarkar cleverly avoids that he is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence and in doing that he pieces together the various elements of this way of life like robert altmanalthough im not comparing bhandarkar to altmans genius bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive whether it is a page wannabe nri the gatecrashers the newlyrich an upcoming model a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate charactersketch even if their parts may be miniscule and therein lays the films appeal konkona sen sharma plays madhavi sharma a young and talented journalist who covers page for nation today initially content with her job she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic profligacy but bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moralpolicing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone hence the movie is not only about madhavi but also equally about deepak suriboman irani madhavis editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery anjali thaparsoni razdan a socialite suffocating from the social pollution abhijeetrehan engineer a homosexual makeup artist and madhavis roommates pearlsandhya mridul the sassy airhostess and gayatritara sharmaan aspiring actress it seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many charactersand more in one story but full credit to nina arora and manoj tyagi for penning a tight screenplay the dialogues by sanjeev datta and bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail any narrative no matter how good can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances thankfully page brims with actors and not stars konkona goes through her authorbacked role with effortless ease ditto boman sandhya mridul gets the best written part but almost overdoes it atul kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character at times the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possiblepaedophilia homosexuality etc but the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed ultimately bhandarkars attempt is to satiate our voyeurism but he takes it a step further he takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world these are the same people that indulged in newyears revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by natures ferocity clever writing skillfully incorporated songs able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values page is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema abhishek bandekarrating poor average good very good excellent th january
0,im actually watching this film as i write this if the following comments prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then so be it but i thought am still thinking as im presently viewing that this film to put it mildly is very very overrated again veryit looks like a really really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources and who didnt pay that much attention to detaili dont want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but well i just dont get it rememeber i fully admit that maybe its me thats the idiot here not the film maker for not getting this piece of imaginative genius i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very very outstanding sheesh

1,i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ago i watched it for what it was a collection of music videos its not a movie it doesnt have a plot nor a central storyline its a rather artistic anthology of mostly longform videos all of them rather smartly or creatively done michael jackson may be considered a freak these days but after all this was the man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set trends with billie jean and beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects live performance footage and even selfparody the badder sequence and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there this video came out just a tad before he became a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the choreographed section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point
1,hilarious film i had a great time watching it the star cuneyt arkin sometimes credited as steve arkin is a popular actor from turkey he has played in lots of toughguy roles epicsword films and romances it was fun to see him with an international cast and some real lousy looking pair of gloves if i remember it was also dubbed in english which made things even more funnier kinda like seeing john wayne speak turkish
1,when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldnt see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though im not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot
1,i wasnt off a great deal from this film so girl was pleasantly note when i watched it and found it to is most dominate its dead is mainly due to the talent and is of is star john garfieldgarfield plays jack a boxing star their its framed for murder he must go on the run and ends up earthy in the sticks with gloria dickson and the dead she kids here ever offered a chance for redemption yet will the past catch up with he yet and was an actor with of his amazing before the term here was even coined and before brando ever screamed istella he brings natural to the screen his out quality garfield acting peers talent noteworthy this production that interesting be that his role here as a boxer to shades of also golden boy role noteworthiness so desperately wanted to covet on screen garfield looks the type proving his the distance as a thought and his acting very sheridan is here in a small role at as beginning as jacks trampy boxer goldie i havent is i much of sheridan but i liked her method end plays worthann expecting garfield dicksons performance is a little tired and she does not share good here ahead garfield the he end kids are chemistry and garfield seems who natural idol even more so than cagney claude rains appeal miscast and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene strange the he always was such a reliable actoralso interesting has surprised is the director busby berkeley best known for goes early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images directs a different genre here with remarkable ease him maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirablya well good film that deserves greater attention
1,shtrafbat penal battalion is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during world war two one can almost call it the russian equivalent of highly acclaimed band of brothers miniseriesformed in july of on the eve of battle of stalingrad the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties sometimes as high as prisoners of gulag political prisonconcentration camps deserters soldiers who were captured by germans but managed to escape soldiers accused of breaching protocol were all given a chance to join the shtrafbat and prove that there were not traitors of the motherland with their lives those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the lawthis miniseries features a look at one such shtrafbat under the command of tverdokhlebov an honorable officer who was captured by the germans was shot and left for dead it features a colorful and varied group of people thrust into a situation from which there is no escape the authoritative yet honorable crime boss antip kulak the fist and his little gang of unreformed criminals a young jewish intellectual who struck his antisemite officer father orthodox priest mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed in the housetohouse fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the gulag but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living and to keep on fightingalthough set during a war not every episode features combat in fact what combat scenes there are are often chaotic sporadic and short which was probably the intent of the director in between the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and tragedies the rape of a young woman by one of shtrafbats soldier and then his execution execution for supposed awol periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a german bunker stocked with food and champagne the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors cheating on a spouse and other situations feature prominently the camera is unflinching it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature nor from raw human emotions the dialog likewise does not censor out the swearingthe acting is superb and deep and the script is likewise well written everything from rage to weariness to resignation to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to is rendered almost faultlessly one complaint might be that some of russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture because it is a history drama in a sense some of the terms and situations military rank mention of other battles certain historical references may be lost on some viewers this understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy shtrafbat but these references are a nice touch of authenticity another complain that could be levied is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps

0,daft potboilers dont come much dafter than this but its a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright except in this case it doesnt based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas he wrote the robe and already filmed in with irene dunne and robert taylor its got more uplift than a cantilever brarock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it no it sint quite that daft he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy in between times they fall in lovetry as i might i cant quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirks films this one isnt too deep on the plus side rock hudson isnt half bad i think i am rediscovering him and of course it looks great in sirks films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soapopera terms this is definitely daytime tv
1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score out of
0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit creaky for any genuine praisethe film is in a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism the locals there is very feel to james whales frankenstein and this is by the introduction of atwills dr niemann character complete his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme arbitrary and only used as redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go the rampage as if they needed is one of a of early horror films in which lional atwill fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely device to fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and is worth director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later
0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose seppaku going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime ministerif this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this
1,this is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome film maker earnestness of todays politicallyminded filmmakers at that place a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a motion picture show stiff rarity these days while the extrasensory perception bouyant optimism of the s cant be regained i think we hear can at least learn a lesson from the films breezy energy and charm i dont know what those who label the film boring were stiff watching there theres fukkianese so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that min at a time
0,when i first became a father about years ago i was prepared for many of the sacrifices id have to make i knew id have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a freezing santa claus parade but i wasnt ready for the kind of sacrifice i made last night this in my humble opinion is cruel and unusual punishmentunderdog is bad its not quite karate dog bad but it makes the shaggy dog feel like pulp fiction if underdog were a television show id recommend flipping on by not even the presence of puddy and the voice of banky edwards can save it bow wowit was also just about the best minutes ive ever enjoyed james was seated to the right of me and michelle to the left and i spent more time watching their reaction to this talking flying mutt than watching the screen at and years old they were the target audience and this movie nailed the target theres a scene where underdog belches loudly in another dogs face and michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film when underdog was flying into outer space james was literally at the edge of his seat mesmerized the kids absolutely loved underdog and thats why i was there thats what last night was all aboutunless youre accompanying someone under the age of ten you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film but if you are looking to kill minutes with your four year old i wont judge i had a blast
0,i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel assault i had translate the reexamine and get wind the monition and i thought i was prepared for anything at salutary i thought a faithful if misguided attempt at an original adaptation at worst a sogooditsbad design for the new millennium so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the united kingdom i joked to my friends prepare for the worst movie ever made oh cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to advocate this film the limited upshot expression like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx the acting is terrible the emphasize are worse than terrible one artillery mans accent appear to take us on a duty tour of the british isles from scotland to wale via northern ireland the dialogue is contrived the editing is nonexistent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words really cannot key out how tough this movie is from the union iris flying from the horribly cgid thunderchild the royal navy flies the white national flag not the union iris to the woodworm ridden acting this is quite simply a offense against film hit when you consider some of the literallyzerobudget fan films that are available on the net the star wars short troops for example the unharmed were enthusiastic amateur argument goes compensate out of the window and if you think an interview with hines on the pendragon website this film had an figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial tomentum does not come bum in the us mayhap the problem is that hines centennial state time tested to make a film of the book rather than turn the book into a film if that makes any sense characters and extras spurt chunks of school text verbatim without nerve wracking to convey the feelings behind the words ironically enough the only person who even derive snug to cave in a decent performance was darlene peter sellers the exsoft porn actress my advice implore like crazy that jeff mad anthony wayne doesnt screw up and go watch the steven spielberg version it may not be true to the school text of the book but i can say this as a womb to tomb hg wells fan and englishman as well speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book mayhap customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i want them back
1,this movie starts off slowly and gets running towards the end not that that bad it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character consequently if you are not into tragedies this is not your it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile if you liked dostoyevskys crime punishment you will probably like if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the movie prompts is what is that makes a renowned writer disregard his publiclyaproved ideas for another set the new ideas quite opposed to the status quoif are a conservative you will not like movie besides philosophical i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start also was of coloric symbolism in representing the of the main characters if these sorts of things do not impress you it overall i give this movie a
0,there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us version the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got the us version of this show is everything that reality tv shouldnt be instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt i do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive the rather vulgar product placement that takes place particularly by sears is also uncalled for rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses

1,with a film starring the twins ekin cheng and edison chen expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a film is on the and the brain there are loads of vampires no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes the occasionally very funny moment and chansure the kungfu relies heavily on work and cgi sure the script reminds you of and sure the whole affair is for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic you would be hard pushed to find better
1,this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy but profane woman who is in but finds a way to survive and be the hero sound familiar there are plenty of holes in this story things dont add up some of the suspense is little corny but that suspense is very good there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it the story starts off but kicks in pretty soon and stays that making it movie for viewer thats why i give it a pretty good rating the movie you involved in it bullock is more cute than annoying which she normally is to me so this is my highestrated movie with her it
1,i was quite surprised to read some of the comments and this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ago i watched it for what doing household a collection of music videos its not a movie it doesnt have a plot may a creatively and its a time artistic anthology of choreographed longform videos all of them rather smartly freak central done michael jackson what be considered a point these days but after all this was create man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the rather music video of all greatest and set out with billie jean and beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who it once him mostly again took his music incorporating dance moves to the some vividly entertaining stuff and claymation special effects live performance footage and even selfparody sequence badder the or for those wondering nor joe pesci was collaborated there this video came trends just a tad before he became a was name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film storyline imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the with section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that on
0,hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap reinvented over and over again take superheroes for example for each xman and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of mr gore verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman based horrors eg the ring the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudgesthe first grudge wasnt entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge the critic goes the same waytired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichs all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dullthe chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldnt enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesnt that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day its getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood bullshits
1,adapting his own novel cabal for the author screenwriter director clive barker this marvelous story of outr horror and fantasy craig sheffer plays boone a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer the cops gun him down in front on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by when they claim to boone and make him one of their own this causes repercussions for everybody boones sweet girlfriend the very anne bobby and dubious psychiatrist a most enjoyable david displays the kind wild and imagination that i dont in movies all that often for one thing mcquarrie an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial star wars entries helps to create excellent visuals for nightbreed starting right away with opening credit sequence the visual and makeup effects are elaborate production design and cinematography quite impressive barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters its colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure take and of course theres the strong sense of social commentary and bigotry not to mention the consequences that can result from a persons actionsgreat supporting performances add to the fun cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent is a real as the bad doctor while charles is a fine lovetohatehim type of a rather nasty police doug pinhead bradley once gets buried heavy makeup as the weary lylesberg and a rock hugh ross is great fun as narcisse as is catherine chevalier as rachel as added bonus bares her breasts in one sequence simon bamford who played butterball cenobite in first two hellraiser pictures turns up here as theres even a cool cameo by s and s scifi star john agardanny elfman supplies his fantastic scores and barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdownnightbreed is an excellent genre film worth checking out for who seen it i give it a hearty recommendation
0,laughing i have no problem with the acting nor the script i do have a problem with the giant bird was was simply awful plain effect simpleones eternal impulse is the roll around personally when one a done was were they thinking budget be damned the monster people it sees monstrous jokeof course in be opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as ankrum corday and morrow then they would have the special and bird come up with a much better beast oh well what is done is it this the my the case of will first joke on them that what unintended
0,this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally and that disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is reason it deserves a and a an example of information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to the is produced in the stomach but it produced in that proportions in case you need good explanation of what in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly the not appear from so it is impossible anyway there is something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with chances conquering the planet but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like say lies like in this mockumentary and what is some buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste time

1,this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up of its lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat fraidy cats previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different eras in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy i watched this movie almost every day as a child o
1,but the general moviegoers mileage may vary in mary american psycho harrons stylized look at the american sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal queen of curves bettie pageill not bore anyone with a recitation of the iconic status of ms page a prim and proper valedictorian from nashville tennessee who moved to new york in hopes of being an actress and ended up becoming the bondage queen of the universe nor will i run through the sketchy biopic plot of the notorious bettie page though i offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind improper use of a period camera notwithstanding finally i wont belabor the timely applicability of the films themes of innocence and perversion freedom and control the sacred and the secular theyre there for the viewer to absorb if they wish the more things change the more they stay the same as the saying goeswhat i will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of gretchen mol as bettie page truth is mols face looks almost nothing like betties nor is she particularly built like bettie although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts and no fool i she doesnt even sport the thick dark bush that concealed ms pages most intimate charms but the fact remains that mol thoroughly embodies the spirit of bettie page in every way shape and form it is a bravura comeback from an undeserved semiobscurity ive never met ms page and sadly never will most likely but ive devoured the photos and videos and read all the bios and interviews available bought the trading cards and other odds and ends and to be honest lusted for ms page ever since i first discovered her in my adolescence between the covers of dusty tease magazines at the barber shop and the five and dime mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as i have come to conceive her no pun intended in what i consider to be an oscarworthy performance liv tyler could never have matched mols shining intensity of characterization in a million years and i for one am grateful she left the project not that id mind seeing her totally naked i hasten to add but i cant imagine that her brand of sensuality would have translated into the innocent exhuberance of bettie pagethe notorious bettie page is not for everyone any more than bondage and discipline are i suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters legions of devoted page fans and the curious will see to that i can only hope that the dvd will be chock full of enough bettie extras to show the uninitiated just how good a job mol has donebeyond that a tip of the hat to a fine supporting cast especially lili taylor and chris bauer as paula and irving klaw whose celebrity photo business was betties doorway to immortalitya final note to the young scribe who opined that ms page had no effect on his generation take a good look at madonnas cone brassiere and get back to us bettie page is whether you know it or not the true godmother of fetishwear without her madonna and the rest of her kin could never have existed
0,hey remember when hal hartley was ingest brilliant what a time that was id say the book of life was when things really started going downhill but i will say that at least he went in truth uphill from this one a movie that looks like it was slight shoot filmed on office someones occupy cell phone wouldnt have to be a bad thing if pronounce it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog chronicle amp but alas those human race thin are missing along with hartleys spare quirky dialog in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian amp end of times and a information technology trite story of a modern jesus in a quandary packaged in a tryingtobehip modern world where everyone looks like thing someone out of a hal hartley movie while it picks up a little in its second half its never enjoyable or especially sensible what the hell happened to you hartley
0,if youve ever listened to any of the james lee burke books on tape or cd and the reader was will patton you may agree with me that will is the personification of dave rtommy lee jones is a native texan or so ive heard and no one portrays a texan better imho but hes not a cajun his delivery is all wrong i lived in the state for several years and i can still hear the strange patois that a louisiana accent contains tlj doesnt have anything like thati thought marry steenbergen was a good choice for bootsy but i missed seeing cletus who will be cast in this role the rock mickey rourke whoever hell have to be bigoverall i thought the movie was only a the plot flopped around like a fish out of water and didnt have the normal interesting yet nonlinear continuity that the book typically hashopefully hollywood will try another jlb book last car to elysican fields would be a good choice wed get to see some of the best villains from jlb ever
0,i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in i remember dialogue from tatum oneal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burtons character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didnt translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awfulthis movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality recall the blue lagoon and other brooke shields annoyances lipstick little darlings beau pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults as a teenager during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the s and s made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speakcircle of two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like blue lagoon in fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you will never see if you didnt see it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again
1,this movie kicks ass bar none bam and his crue have out done themselves with this film since i got the dvd days ago i have watched it three times and it gets better every time i watch it i cant wait for grind to come out in theaters if its anything like haggard it will be worth the waitthanks jtcellphone
1,a hugely enjoyable screen version of rona jaffes bestselling potboiler outpouring about the real trials and tribulations and naturally the loves of a group of women involved in one way or another in the new york publishing business directed by jean negulesco fairly fresh from the non success of three coins in a fountain and the prototype for the likes of sex and here the city except that here the sex existent all takes place offscreenthe bright young female talents of the day hope lange diane baker suzy parker martha hyer homemaker are all nicely cast while joan crawford pops up as a queen bitch of an editor target dorothea lange henry m robert run who could probably eat meryl streeps miranda priestly and spit her out with absolutely no effort at all she steals the movie the men include stephen boyd louis jourdan if it hera wasnt rossano brazzi beryllium it had to be louis path jourdan robert evans before he decided wisely to go behind the camera and brian aherne there are more suds on display than distinct you will find in your average launderette but if inward like me you enjoy blue jean desperate housewives not to mention carrie bradshaw and company then by nature editor in chief you will probably love this a very guilty pleasure

1,one the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema or indeed most anything done outside these holierthanthou united are the permutations that crop up in postworld war two japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects many of them handled in imaginative fashion thing happens genre filmmaking as well though again im referring to movies made outside the u where were too sophisticated in closemindedness to appreciate anything that isnt about by us would an company for instance back not one but a series of movies a masked professional wrestler el santo a werewolf paul naschy or a reallife artist bruce lee as for television forget it while i love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine ive always felt that the version asian martial was how to put kindly a bit lacking to this very day there hasnt been channel to feature martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia there are lots of softcore porn masquerading as entertainment shows but the socalled action channel for has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc there was of all things fu that featured group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder deadly venoms in its own right as fascinating as any other genrebased western cop show etc this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work its now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by logan is exactly the of intelligent thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve youre a martial movie fan rejoice of the greatest movie genres of all time specifically the martial arts movies the s and early s are getting longoverdue second life and greatly appreciated second look on dvd

0,inward its unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases put on ie anger at the gay characters thinking french thrillers are bad etc i will admit that im altogether unfamiliar with the novel but as a film after about minutes i was slew rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before i get adequacy sick of spending anymore time on this film over the hours particularly of its running length hours food market ingest that felt like dont get any longer discontinue me wrong i can sit through hour and a half silent films hour epics i dont have a short attention span nor am closed book i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery list of complaints first off the at that place ending yes it had a scoobydooesquire remnant murder character explains everything at the end now sit down i actually think for this movie this was necessary just the film had so many distance cease plottwists emotional revelations new facts surfacing and being discovered one reviewer said it well yes it is a very logical story but without the very essential back story their childhood stories the relationship amongst the worm parents the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man it or so just doesnt feel right i felt cheated i wont throw in unjust too many spoilers here some other i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary but according to the reviews on here theres a lot of people who seem to really ingest love this to a fault so i written material dont want to give anything away i personally cant stand soap operas the complexity and pronounce twists and turns for me snuffed out any impact the final ramp up revelations could possibly deliver by the end i seriously didnt care there werent any gaping plot holes necessarily get along this seems like it could make a great book in writing it is nettle perfectly logical but if im supposed to believe this is reality something apply doesnt sit right with amp the pieces that sufficiency have been haphazardly inserted too a great deal often amp i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot increase the emotion and develop the mystery the acting i had no complaints about the directing eh not bad but the plot and especially its development severely lacking sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller but i couldnt far get into it i gave this a seem simply because i dont want to seem completely unfair and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement major spoiler and i equal refresh have john roy major to mention it but when the max father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldnt fit in another twist your father gravely didnt take die in a hunting accident i rescue almost died when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious ontogenesis like the take cristal already complex plot involving characters from all the families put on and their relationship to one another wasnt enough does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed sorry i had to to a fault throw sire in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as much as ive ever been bothered in any film

0,st watched out of dir pete riski weird psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being tested in a hospital the power flickers and then all hell breaks loose im honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one what we get for the next hour and a halfat least it wasnt longer was a twisted horrortwilight zonezombiefestghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very end initially after the power goes out everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father there is the typical annoying character a creepy old man and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and of course the young girl the main character gets attracted to random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing a hinting that time has stopped and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever theyre in of course the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and i really hate how they used this girls affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame we never really find out the answer to what was going onwhich is very strange so please avoid this dog unless you want to be creeped out and confused for one hour and a half this is not for you or any moviegoer what a waste of timereally
0,i really liked the far cry game nice graphics good leveldesign interesting and clever enemies aboveaverage length and even a somewhat decent plot i am not by default against movie spinoffs of games i thought doom the movie was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible well not the length the movie runs only a merciful min the characters are even more stereotypical than in the game which is quite an achievement the entire plot is told without any twists or mystery several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story and come on genetically modified soldiers they could have come up with some better namehowever this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene i have never seen anything of the like i could not believe they were trying to be serious we have to get out of the wet clothes i think ill get hypothermia although everybody is wearing tshirts we need to cuddle together for body warmth is that your gun but but werent there people who consciously did this there must have been a scriptwriter a director actors a gaffer an electrician some food guy why didnt anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening was this film done by ravaging inhuman genetically modified film people i wont start at ranting about how many logical errors inconsistencies and scriptwriting flaws there were but even to the diehard actionfan this cant be anything but insultingthis film did actually ask for being rated out of so ill do it that favor but that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from specialeffects nah acting not really references to the game you wish wait they used the font from the game for the title and the credits that was neatif you are looking for a flick for a bad movie night go for supernova this one is just sad
1,what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i saw this at the atlanta georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very much a scifi aficionado and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning this is not a scifi nor action film of any sort let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari having watched a few episodeshis performance in that seemed stale and robotic but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen cellular i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story which i think was even more his goalseeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend

0,this movie supposedly a zero thriller had about five subplots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end but it ended up more documentary film as a washington yawnthe writing was trite the pace was slow there and disjointed and written material alone arrive the characters were boring george clooney looks like he tone needs to get into a gym matt damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompterthe worst part of this movie was that wa it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it washington ended up saying nothing at all about big business oil and the middleeast i have seen documentaries atomic number provide more excitement watch it only if theres absolutely nothing else to do

0,oh first films like this not bother me if this movie truth and to close big is then i assume that rommel knew liked to a time before wwii started in the movie rommel mentions how hitler trouble changed from actors well i cant imagine that rommel wouldnt have known something hitler hitlers government policies so rommel place share some guilt for the german atrocities with that in it before have a problem to a movie that makes rommels life at movie end a tragic one he made his choices and we have with feel scenes for him i cant do it i also cant buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to fight the war the allies would without had more had winning mind if more competent people were in charge wwii may never the started in the playing place from a the watching aspect the film jumps from place to must and most of have time seems like a history special with for name i boy has historical roles leo g carroll the a couple of good bad with james mason supposed i about the fact that everyone spoke english have the ridiculous accents but other than that really very essential
1,i saw this film on tv in the uk some years ago of late and it has resonated first class with me ever since my interest has recently been rekindled by visiting come across hilton head the next island over from yamacraw daufuskie long time actually and reading pat conroys excellent the gain water is wide with the benefit of knowledge i have reappraised conrack and consider it a masterpiece jon voight captures the in reality spirit of conroy amp and the atmosphere of the child film brings the book to life with some accuracy a hollywood rarity three things maine still strike me child rap about this tale the issues of educating the poor and disenfranchised and pastime being inclusive remain the same education is about more than reading and writing these kids were my peers i was in when pat conroy spent his year on daufuskiewhy this has not made it on to dvd yet
0,i saw this movie with the purpose of not liking it i sure didnt its one of those movies that seems to have been made alone for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long run short sepiatoned imagination pretentious title no sex and a genius that explain everything he thinks and concludes in sfxcgi so that we the dolt audience take it one matter that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong or else they call the nobelprice named after an actual person called alfred nobel the nobleprice jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big output purportedly based on a true report what a fake what were you and the others thinking ron
0,so i charter this movie desire to learn about the democratic republic of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from belgian harness i was excited to become familiar with the figures affect in its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial harness the political motivation backside each one the reasons backside belgiums decision to give the drc its independence and also how the united states and the former ussr were affect unhappily all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was constitute by people who through a passing casualness with the story of the drcs fight for freedom visualise a story filled with dramatic event and emotion and distinct to feat it they then proceeded to seek and gormandise all the dramatic points into a storyline concisely filled them out with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so its all the sadder because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and finish up annotate over all detail in an cause to produce an encompassing history any the conclude the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentencelong statements and facts printed on the screen the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main approximation of whats going on completely smoothing over the actual detail in favor of getting across the braggart things for instance there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the situation the soldiers have potential viewpoints one that empathise with lumumba one that rail lumumba and one that stands in the middle understand and yet obey society correspondingly there are soldiers that speak in the scene uttering blood that unadornedly present their points of aspect then to forefend dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriter simply inserted some random shooting more army guys present up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motivation the other fictional character respond with theirs and thats that theres slight telling through actions even the things they say are unmediated the point of distressingness its hard to believe that the people defend in reality acted like that also in the trend of this straightness things like political tension between faction is slenderize to simple recognition of the fact we never learn what these faction are what theyre fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the fictional character likewise are onedimensional and flat unfortunately i dont make love whether lumumba was in reality a freedom fighter passionately consecrate to ideal of congolese unity but after an minutes or so of the movie i sure as shooting didnt trustingness it to tell me so the drc like many developing countries has a complicated and important history particularly in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails to give proper tending to these detail and ends up telling the viewer slight except the most general of lineation
1,i just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers cab calloway bessie smith not josephine baker or sophie tucker who was white thomas fats waller bill bojangles robinson stepin fetchit notwithstanding louis armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed cotton club in harlem true stereotypes are there but this was the way it was and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature harmann ising cartoons tended to be more cutesy and more upscale after all we are talking about mgm than the standard animated short done over at warners paramount universal fox rko or lowly columbia even disneys very early mickey mouse had loads of barnyard humor before uncle walt cleaned him up just before he went technicolordisney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well for example s silly symphony woodland cafe but we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place years from now clips of the simpsons family guy and south park will be also scrutinized analyzed and even vilified by future viewers
1,minor spoilersmisunderstood classic remains one of hensons finest and most personal films it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one misunderstood but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry juhls snappy screenplay and saint paul hank williams knockout songs now while these things are admittedly great as is the pic formal playfulness screenplaywithinthescreenplay film damp etc what distinguishes the muppet movie from the other muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture its a road movie all in good order but like most road pic the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never rattling go dorsum again end to end the film we are show the down position of display business even before the muppets have cook it piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent gonzo state the loneliness and regret of a performers life on the road in his persistent im become to go dorsum there someday and forged of all kermit is continually anguished and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the diabolical of purpose one can only wonder what henson would have cook of his familys management of the accompany after his death kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the terminal magic store come questions whether its all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesnt topic either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and irony and lusciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldnt work if it werent but the muppet movie isnt just another jokefest as the lie of the diminishingreturn muppet films would become no its a lovely patrician metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and its every burn as in effect now as it was eld agone out of

1,its not sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a great career but taken as a whole because there are no famous personalities the film seems more realistic than some high budget well cast filmsa film made for a few bucks that is worthy of watching should give hope to all those would be film makers and wantabee actorsthe problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time tv was taking over the revenues of the film industry and this film could have easily been shown on tv in all the fare on tv would qualify for a g rating the film industry began to make more adult films that could not be shown on tv during the days when tv wouldnt dare show the sex and skin of todays commercials
0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later
1,the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors it isnt their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry eitherto me it is the misenscene of the entire movie the settings the lighting the props all add to the mood for love between the main characters a whiff of smoke from chows cigarette tells us his state of mind the everchanging tightfitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects the constraints of decisionmaking the ruins of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leadsthe excellent use of misenscene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters relationship the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more
1,in this satire of the commercialization and lightheartedness of war john cusack plays brand hauser an assassin sent to to turaqistan to take out omar sharif who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former vice president of the uss own company in addition to this hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer a wedding for pop princess yonica hillary duff and a nosy liberal journalist natalie marisa tomeiassessing the technical aspects the acting by the main charactersat least was good as was to be expected some of john cusacks dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it maybe unrealistic is more accurate joan put forth a great and often hilarious performance marisa tomei while ive never been a big fan of hers was more than suitable for the role and worked well hillary duff however was pretty terrible they needed an attractive middle eastern or russian or whatever that accent was supposed to be popstar unfortunately they went for with her like i said above the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points especially john cusacks dialogue not much of it mind but some the story also got a bit ludicrous at points which is fine for a satire to a point but it took it to a whole new level here luckily the cusacks and tomei keep a relatively cool calm demeanor throughout and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film and the levelheadedness of the actors joshua seftel who previously had a drought of real credits to his name did a fine job with a rather widespectrum film he handled the small million budget very well stretching it to make it appear to be much more seftel also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story with the painful and hardtowatch parts of the real war including slaughter of civilians etc as far as the general satire goes its exaggerated look on the commercializing of war is very well done especially the golden palace poker ads on the us tanks at points it becomes a little too much but in the end it still accurate portrays what its going for an a young mel brookstype of styleoverall the film is very well made for the meager budget and its definitely worthy of a look it wont go down as one of the great satires of cinema but its certainly not the worst
0,i like animated shows i enjoy the nick fare pretty much including hey arnold but moving a tv show to the big screen isnt easy and this just didnt feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the show and it just didnt move along that well judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didnt score that well with them either
0,a lowrent cheaply made police thriller thats kept bearable by some fair humorous bits the nice chemistry between the two leads interpersonal chemistry and especially by james remars stingily satisfying amp turn as run a chintzily narcissistic psychopathic and naturally indestructible villain obviously a lowquality picture both visually and dramatically with a rather resigned burt but not unwatchable
1,first the obviousas a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama quay is disconcerting straightly independent and a menace to banality jouvets aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force his antoine is not so much a man of intellect but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct quay is not subversive in the sense that todays and already yesterdays philistines enjoy using the word it is clouzots most playful hour he tended to adapt steemans books in a satiric note its said that clouzot was a big reader of detective novels as a director clouzots firm hand is successful it is not a mystery or a thrillerbut a satirical look at a parisian couple and at the polices proceedings those accustomed with clouzots masterpiece les diaboliques might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things styles elements in quay here clouzot speaks about many things about a couple and a hidden love story simone renants for blierabout the entertainments world and about old spinsters about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise etc there is a note of exuberancenot only in jouvets performance but also in the films conception quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire it offers an outstanding performance by jouvet as a tough police inspector antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past he fought in africa but did not climb the ranks stair because of his independent behaviors he lives with his son a schoolboy at work antoine is tough and merciless an able inspector bitter intelligent and harsh it is a role of great gusto very picturesque jouvet composed his character of several defining traitshis clothes his expression his funny accent his brutality and that mocking air antoine is not made to look more clever than plausible when he interrogates blier antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real lifemixed with errors and lacunae and defects antoines talent is one that comes also from experience from daily observationits not the almost supernatural divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectivesquay is multifacetedit is a realistic crime drama and also a satire and a melodrama one can consider it among the first filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the french police long ago eastwoods and waynes harsh cops there was antoine the title is interesting suggesting that this is a movie about the police not about a case or a mystery as craftsmanship clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in france in the way that welles was quay is very true to clouzots naturea sardonic comic sharp observations much psychology sharp unsparing irony the man was firstclass when he filmed somethinghe knew what to shoot what to choosesee the introductory scenes of this film with jenny lamours great stage success each scene is memorably exemplarily shot clouzots technical stylistic aptitudes were amazing his style is inventive satirical sharp extremely limpid ingenious jouvets style was exuberant powerful vehement some disliked it precisely for these features as he had been a great stage actor his movie style was deemed as too theatrical etc his antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role by a composition jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomymuch like a menacing bird of preysomewhat like van cleefyet much subtler nobler and more intelligent and distinguished jouvet had this predatory ferocious air and it is useful here as he performs an old tough cop one of quay s sides is that it is a jouvet recital he is immediately recognizable identifiable by the quality of his play i see that many watching this flick do not know it is a jouvet moviewhich is an astounding quality in itself fresnay and jouvet are the two french actors that i admire the most the first one was revealed to me by a renoir drama the famous one while jouvet by a carn comedy i was charmed to see that clouzot gave leading roles to both of themto end a word about steeman he wrote the novel used by clouzot who had previously adapted another steeman novel as a fresnay comedy steeman was an old school mystery writer in the wallace vein he became quickly outdated with the new hardboiled fashions when i was i have read one of his thrillers and liked it much
1,i couldnt disagree more with those who says this is a lousy movie me and my friend went to see it during the stockholm film festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival dolls being used in horror movies arent something new but i havent seen that many movies were it has been as well carried out as it is in this movie the atmosphere the setting the actors the camerawork everything is just beautiful and they really work well with each other now if you expect this film to be another grudge or ring then you probably wont like it but if your out for a good stylized scare then its perfect even though its pretty predictable and at some times laughable i still recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks go see it now
1,when the italians and miles okeeffe work together nothing can go wrong as ever miles is great as the almost as great ator the most lovable barbarian of all times totally lives up to the first movie
1,spaced invaders is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen i dont understand why this movie didnt get better critics its funny harmless and sweet i first watched it when i was and i really fell in love with it days later i got it on vhs p till today ive shown it to many friends and they all liked it but nobody knew the movie before i think thats the problem nearly nobody knows it so nearly nobody can like it this movie never got a real chance thats sad si has really the potential of a comedy like monsters inc or spaceballs ok enough displeasure what i really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh your head off watch it even if you dont get mad about it its worth watching prepare to laugh earth scum
1,a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the s hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian

0,this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film my uncles home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crapthe plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island the man has a very cheap paper mach looking handthe acting is atrocious in this movie there are scene changes at the drop of the hat for instance for at least seconds we see some guy humming a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life i dont think this movie could get any worse then it already is i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong and i hate chuck norris
0,not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the s but not for the st century
0,this comedy is really not funny it a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact its a caper film so derivative yes even back then it has no snapthe cast is adequate more than that its hard to say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real impressionits a generic knockoff and who wants that
1,fado is a sad almost bluesy style of portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly trough the movie as explained by one of the main characters igor it also means fateindeed its fate that bring the two main characters paco and alex together and triggers the problems that ensueon the whole i enjoyed it quite a bit it starts out as an on the down and outs dramaroad movie an builds into a suspenseful thriller road moviethere were two things that i found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a higher rating i gave it an the first is the major point of why did alex give the stuff away she was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport for a paltry sum and then she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger her explanation was unconvincing also how did they get through the gate where were the cops
1,first of all i need to say that im portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even noneand the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the s when leo da estrela e costa do castelo were among the worlds best of their time with movies like pulsao zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in commonthis one is also good not of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy in fact its officially a drama a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid the plot works and can surprise us a few times the actors are fine the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenixif you want to watch a portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills one to be measured
0,where can i begin i heard this movie was coming out and i was very mad i am a huge fan of the original carlitos way and when i heard about this i thought it would be just like almost all the other sequels that come out in hollywood i thought it would be bad boy was i wrong this movie was much worse than i expected not saying all sequels are bad but thats the problem with hollywood these days they make too many sequels and remakes and rush them this was not a theater release it is a dvd release still in my opinion there was no reason at all for this to be made after i heard about this film was in progress i then later heard pacino was not in it that right away killed any chance this movie had of being good why did i check this movie out then some of you may ask well i had the opportunity to see it so i did i dont only watch movies that i have high expectations of i had low expectations on this one obviously i just wanted to see if it would have anything relevant in it now if any of you reading this are a carlitos way fan you know a lot of the story in the first one has to do with him going to jailvery minor spoiler i wont ruin anything because this may actually make you not want to waste hours watching this trash all i will say is in the end of carlitos way we dont see carlito go to jail now i dont know about any of you but i would have thought a prequel to carlitos way would show how he ended up in jail i even had some interest in actually seeing what happenednow thats not my only problem with the film the actor who played carlito did not do too bad a job but he could not have saved this film if he tried theres not even all those little things that should be thrown in there that carlitos way fans would like you dont see any appearance of kleinfeld or other key characters in the first one i would have liked to see something like that what is even worse is luis guzman is in this film yet he doesnt play the same character he plays in the first film big mistake on their part why cast the same actor for a different character it made the movie worse than it already wasbottom line i am a carlitos way fan this new straight to dvd release is a disgrace if you are a fan dont watch this movie coming in with high expectations this movie did basically nothing for me and it is definitely one movie i wont be picking up on dvd or watching ever again
0,this film is just as bad as the birdman of alcatraz i do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures moreover it disturbs me when well respected revered actors like alan alda and burt lancaster play such roles because their status tends to lend credibility to the directors intent to elevate the films subject a societal outcasti was in junior high school during the last years of caryl chessmans life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news i remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and chessman was the victimget a grip people read the history chessman was a criminal and sexual predator he drove around the la streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle he stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest then abducted and raped the women rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and humiliationchessman got exactly what he deserved it just took a decade too long no sympathy for the devil here
0,amp thought i just might get a few laughs from this long drawn out film but was sadly disappointed mr this film motion picture show adjudicate is all about losers who spend most altogether of their time trying neer to get a passing grade with out even trying to open a book or accomplish anything the associate in nursing exactly film also motion picture show portrayed world health organization teachers and the principal mary tyler moore mrs starklabor pains as complete idiots i know this was suppose to be a comedy but it never made me laugh and i thought the entire film was a just complete waste of time however all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to make this film an enjoyable and entertaining film just plain studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go
1,the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch
1,i think this film has much to recommend it particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very very hard to follow in some cases all in all it makes for a nice time in front of the tube
0,im actually watching this film as i write this if the following comments prove my dissimilar information technology lack of development as a unalike true artistic film maker along then so be it but i thought am still thinking as im altogether presently perchance viewing that this film to put it mildly is very very overrated again veryit looks like a in truth really really bad real student film done overrate by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources and who didnt pay that much attention to detaili dont want to go on and on non equal regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but well the likes of esthetic i just dont get it rememeber i fully admit that maybe its me thats the idiot here not the film maker for not getting this wanting piece of imaginative genius i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very very outstanding sheesh

0,my yearold daughter alexandra writesi thought it was very boring and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at the beginning they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
0,first of all can be divided into three segments a promising opening with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne this is followed by what be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast candice bergen and soldier blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison miss spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a s jack nicholson movie i mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village this is so obviously to lay antiwar propaganda that it comes as simply long outrageous and contrived not recommended merk jacobe comment above heres an idea why dont you actually the movie you are commenting on instead of chirping your liberal nonsense this is not a political site is reviewing films merk
1,ah classic comedy at the point in the movie where brains get messed together a two minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole moviefor years and years bruce campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him we want to see weird movies like bubba ho tep we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies and we want to see man with the screaming brain with the title alone one knows that its going to border that completely silly type of movie like army of darkness only with more silly and less monstersthe idea of the movie is simple bruce sees doctor doctor has new idea bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor coincidentally its the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him hilarity ensueswith the addition of ted raimi as a weird russian guy and journeyman stacy keach as dr ivan ivanovich ivanov its funny that does this movie complete funny never a point of scaryif you like the silly bruce campbell youll like this then again why would you be watching this if you didnt like bruce campbell
0,i dont know what the oscar voters saw in this movie but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar all i know is that fortunately there was gene kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as i believe it is first of all i dont think leslie caron was really fit to play such a role she isnt that talented she isnt a great dancer and shes not good looking at all its a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if leslie caron hadnt been in this it might have made a terrific movie the story was intelligent the directing wasnt bad and as i said gene kelly was pretty good now im not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her im just saying it because i think thats what the worse part of the movie is shes probably a good actress but i cant tell because i havent seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in an american in paris so if you want to see it go ahead but im telling you youre way better off watching singin in the rain
0,although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of its intrigue i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these charactersthis won first place at cannes in which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogetherthis is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once its over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like this film at every turn
0,not the upright of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of go over about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this pic disappointed me the sound and environs was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a repugnance thriller pic but there was no repugnance no thriller the only scene where i suffer frighten away was during the chapter switch scene render wednesday there are lots of fragments i the pic most of the things are remaining unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell uranium about the women or other scenes that is shown mightiness be a good pic to watch in the s but not for the st c
0,no wonder this movie never saw the light of day the timing was of the release was awful the gong show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie came out so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show and the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic minute whine by chuck barris about how hard his life was as host of the show did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messedup millionaire life did he really think we even wanted to know about his life obviously so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a cia operative did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for minutes or the network executive hounding him at every turn this might have worked as the plot for a minute sitcom episode but not as a fulllength movie however it was nice to see rip taylor gene gene and the unknown comic again although to make the movie spicy they included only his most vulgar routines and as someone else has pointed out this is phil hartmans first significant movie part even though it lasts only a minute note his name is spelled hartmann in the credits which is the name he was born with you cant miss his voice and facial expressions even though hes much thinner and younger than in the snl days ed molinaro hill street blues also has a tiny part one of his first after leaving the soap world

0,sit down a plot that fizzled and reeked of information technology irreconcilable differences in opinions demise constituted a older judgmental shake havoc with one side prolife information technology and the other a destroyer of a demons seed the horror was left associate in nursing out and replaced with information technology an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill ingest dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself being a fan of masters of horror since the subsequently beginning this ridiculous plot twist with its sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to cum supplant see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the arrive end
1,well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didnt see any humor he doesnt even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for years both there and in buffalobut i didnt think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesnt make the story funny back in the s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies whats so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox diehard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldnt wear it and viceversamaybe to someone who doesnt follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut its a fact of life or any bittime sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laughthe art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltins animation favorites from the national film board of canada
0,definitely not worth the rental but if you catch it on cable youll be pleasantly surprised by the cameosimans appearance is especially selfdeprecating its also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from the sopranos typecast themselves
1,paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film ive ever seen often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some journo once called it the thinking persons nightmare on elm street and while i accept the logic of his conclusion i cant help but think its a tag that is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate theyre really not thinking at all in fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea quite simply paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart as someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing to be honest i make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste stop reading now because theres more to come its so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood often overlooked in a seamless and convincing way and yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away add to all this an incredibly talented director bernard rose imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack youre ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why i have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express
0,hey remember when hal hartley was brilliant what a time that was id say the book of life was when things really started going downhill but i will say that at least he went uphill from this one a movie that looks like it was filmed on someones cell phone wouldnt have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog but alas those are missing along with hartleys spare quirky dialog in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian end of times and a trite story of a modern jesus in a quandary packaged in a tryingtobehip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie while it picks up a little in its second half its never enjoyable or especially sensible what the hell happened to you hartley
1,its a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so its a good match if you want to the guy or the girls

1,chuck joness beep beep so called despite the fact that the road runner clearly says meep meep is the second of the exceptionally popular road runner series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor the historically important but lacklustre fast and furryous while it features several predictable quickfire gags beep beep also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious longer sequences chief among these is a fantastic extended chase through an old mine in which we see the coyote and the road runner represented by two small lights theres also a very funny longer gag involving some rocketpowered rollerskates beep beep also sees a great improvement in the representation of wile e coyote not only does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype in fast and furryous but he also draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of imminent pain although its a little slow to get going too many lingering shots of blueprints hinder the pace in some of the early gags once beep beep arrives at the mine shaft sequence its clear that jones was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them there are better road runner cartoons than beep beep but theres a real feeling of triumph about this cartoon as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be milked out of this scenario
0,true ive read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this non film i cant say that i found much to recommend it the leonard cohen job refresh sound amp track is not take place only excessively heavyhanded but dreary beyond measure the film looks authentic enough watch out logic gate but somethings zero got to happen for it to work and nothing much does a cursory plot not a real slant problem for me not much character development nothing thematically it just slogs along have it away flawed as it is ciminos heavens gate has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film id sooner watch again for a brilliant reconception of the west hbos deadwood is much superior to mccabe

0,demon wind is about as much playfulness as fracture your legs it is definitely an awful example of a shoot so awful in fact that i dont even consider it a movie i depict it more as a thing a grievous thing a thing that must be kibosh at all costs my booster and i first happen upon this thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my booster house it was a recently night and we had nothing better to do so we settle to watch some punk horror movies we regrettably picked this one considerably during the minutes that this thing play we concluded up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word its just a cheap unwell done ripoff of evil dead the entirely story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his booster by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons blood them to art object i have a depend that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed ive seen bad horror movies before manos troll hobgoblins shudder i would have to say that demon wind could definitely compete with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid filmsfun fact this shoot is the likes of a roach on steroids much the likes of the ouija board board every time we try to go rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of shuddery huh
0,this movie was probably one of the worst movies ive seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply regret ehh where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies blatant dialog such as how ya doingnot that great doc directly after an attempted exorcism of a mans daughter and then his wifes attempted suicide of course hes not that great was at some points kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattooed peirced girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah and they never actually got the deed donethe acting horrible x i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel del zamora and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty music a gun and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody elses acting was horrible as wellthe lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters couldnt be counted on one hand like thumbs downps what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways
0,i remember when this was in theaters reviews said it was horrible well i didnt think it was that bad it was amusing and had a lot of tongueincheek humor concerning families around holiday timeben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract that was funnyso he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read of course the family has a hot daughter for the love interest and he learns that the holidays arent so bad after allalso the whole doodah act was funny especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy and the girlfriendss parents didnt even say anything about it and the parts where doodah is hitting on his supposed daughter final verdict i thought its worth checking out if you catch it on cable
0,again were getting a melange of themes swell track by so many previous films the undecomposed and the bad son story courtesy east of eden the american marine hero story who doesnt consider himself to be one due to what he knows and the sorrow wife potentially falling in making love with some other man storythe mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isnt so often of a job though because theoretically they could still be better award and dealt with each time around no luck this time though as all three of those string at long last fall flavourless all the sameas the bad son neer very gets to spill the beans to his father of the church so that dispute is neer resolved properly asunder from the father of the church kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter recreate the kitchen of the sorrow wife now how satisfying is thatnext the surprisingly return marine suspect his wife of unfaithfulness dispute neer gets resolved because he neer very talks to the man under suspicion namely his own brother so once more were give a light end hereand finally the american military valor lip service theme where the marine is publicly considered a hero when due to the dirtiness of war he went through he shouldnt very be called one as to his own standards that third theme falls flavourless just the same because the moving picture ends right when for the first time hes just able bodied to spill the beans to his wife about what he went through where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely his process of convalescence how that would look like and how he would finally face the family hed have some major guilt to admit to all that all the very interesting bits are passed over and getting ignoredso while story wise this film is a serious and i mean serious disappointment id still give it points for the impressive vomit although no film should use maguire for a voice over because that belong to to spiderman especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to carry out all the outlook he arouse as a young and aspiring actor so often that id in fact making love to see him entrusted with a very deep and demanding lead role of proper profileso while the vomit very seems to do what they can i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise a shallow and at long last ostentatious utterly disappointing tear squeezer so message du jour to the writer we live the wounds already see the emcee of annam films you want to earn some credit usher u a credible healing
0,unfortunately i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango since i am a scifi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested meinstead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick appropriate for an audience of likeminded individuals but very unchristian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions shame on you at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wildeyed crazinessso this bgrade movie and i am being kind production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth groups but if you are a mainline christian or nonchristian you will not be comfortable
0,no its not the repugnance moviethis one is actually a have sex storythe closed chain is a silent film from that ace two boxers and the woman that comes between them she loves the boxer known as one round jack she loves him until the champion comes along that is even though she marries one round she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final examination boxing contend between one round and the champion she comes plump for to one rounds corner just when things look their bare and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the contend and win his wife have sex backthis film was very early in hitchs vocation but the limitations of the fourth dimension mustiness not have made him make a live film although there are particular film tricks and some comedy relief this film just does not hold up up to any of his by and by sour it mustiness have been extremely risqu for the fourth dimension period though with the shameless adulterous wife that may have been the draw plump for in while looking through all of these old celluloid it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on todays screen and really arrive off maybe i should be the oneskip this pic unless you are planning on find out all of hitchcocks celluloid you could diminish asleep in the in between
1,gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a trivialityand to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as dramabut i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years immensely sympathetic performance from jared harriss who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charismahopefully without poor richards penchant for hellraising and haminessand charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer radiant location photography including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to lifeand making magic in the dark

0,i was skimming way from list going films of richard burton when i came to his title that i recall vividly in when i first saw it on cable out i remember dialogue the tatum oneal the that just amazingly bad i brooke richard burtons character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how this motivations didnt translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it never so phenomenally awfulthis movie came out at a time when and was of through didnt rather films period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on fact sexuality recall the blue lagoon america other remember shields annoyances lipstick little darlings beau in and other films was just seemed to dwell on to having sex particularly with adults as a teenager during this time i teenage the obsession combined with the sexual excesses the the s a s made for and subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all pere so teens speakcircle of two is not execrably over or needlessly the like blue lagoon from found it tackles prurient question of love between that young awful of old in a brave if totally failed acted but honestly it is one of those disturbing you will was see if you a see it on would first run because it was so truly and no one its want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again
1,this intensely involving characterdriven suspense drama is like a big juicy piece of shakespeareanlevel steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious totheedge performances from his actors consider for starters henry fondas lone dissenting juror in twelve angry men katharine hepburns delusional mary tyrone in long days journey into night rod steigers conflicted concentration camp survivor in the pawnbroker william holdens wintry lion in network and paul newmans alcoholic lawyer in the verdict the list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past halfcentury and you can safely add philip seymour hoffmans desperately controlling andy hanson to the ranks at director sidney lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue and in fact he revels in the melodramatic turns of firsttime screenwriter kelly mastersons thickly plotted scriptthe scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash woody allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film the oddly pinched cassandras dream but lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception the plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless embezzling funds from his real estate companys payroll to keep his neglected wife gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit smoothtalking andy is about to be exposed in an irs audit meanwhile his younger brother hank is a mass of postdivorce codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support paymentsandy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there the goal was for the brothers to collect the haul and the parents to claim the insurance murphys law intervenes in every possible way starting with andy pressuring hank to do the job himself after some brotherly cajoling hank agrees to it but too scared to do it alone he recruits a reckless guntoting busboy to handle the robbery by fate the heist occurs on the one day that andy and hanks mother is opening the shop and things quickly spiral out of control from there although the backandforth storytelling technique is not new for example alejandro gonzlez irritus grams mastersons approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate eventthe acting is pitchperfect starting with hoffmans riveting performance as andy a machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family i thought he was great in tamara jenkins the savages but he is even better here lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable ethan hawke as hank imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every illplanned move as their embattled father albert finney acts with his typical latecareer bluster but he provides the necessary foundation for the oedipallevel complexities marisa tomei is a smart choice to play gina as the actress economically keys in on the responsive watchful nature of a small but pivotal role the estimable theater veteran rosemary harris now better known as peter parkers aunt in the spiderman trilogy has precious little time as the mother as does amy ryan as hanks bitter exwifethere are scenes that border on excessive especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable after the disappointment of the cartoonish find me guilty it is refreshing to see lumet in peak form here the dvd offers terrifically informative commentary from lumet hoffman and hawke all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout along with the original theatrical trailer there is also a betterthanaverage minute featurette directed by sidney lumet how the devil was made which features onset footage and snippets of interviews with lumet two of the producers and the principal actors
0,spoilers more than likely nothing really important you couldnt have figured out yourselves yeah its really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the bands that had songs in it but after that i had a dikens of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with night of the demons but you know theyre basically the same thing the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time even when screaming wasnt really necessary hed let out a listen up now block the door with cars and so theyd run cars head on into other cars but then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didnt want to come over to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us what was it why was it there why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tvs in a studio i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen but he was kinda far away i mean he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a whim and yes i hated it good day
0,ivan the terrible is more a filmed stage play than a bigscreenopus citizen kane a similar work in many ways is quite the opposite in the way we come to expect such fare in that it has lots of location shooting for exampleacting is meant to convey a characters motivations and thinking to the audience if it succeeds in making you understand the character what does it matter how it was done and considering the low amount of action how else is one to express events that influence the story and consequently the characters machinations and decisions other than exaggerated movementsas well theres a historical level why the acting style should not surprise the rise of totalitarian regimes in germany and ussr forced filmmakers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew how as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed cinemas evolution and techniques they only used what they knewthe nazis control of government in germany destroyed the great german film industry of the s due to their total control over that film industry and propaganda films can only entertain german troops so much hence the need for popular german silent films of the s for example so a lot of ivan the terrible films techniques would have been derived from such captured german films supplied to the film crew as mentioned in other commentsthere was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found overhyped it is by no means a bad cinematic experience and definitely not amongst the worse films ever the acting is fine and part of the cinematography excellent even by todays standards more below definitely not a popcorn flick one cant leave their brain outside this ones door dated perhaps and very symbolic only worth watching on the big screen if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these films chiefly bw experience it all depends upon what expectations one walks in withwarning spoilers do not read the following comments in case they influence your personal view of the filmsand if one does not mind the obvious communist propaganda as opposed to capitalist propaganda for ivan is how stalin saw himself obvious in his influence on the films direction see other comments and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the us perspective will definitely understand this maybe ivan was an earlier incarnation of stalin or maybe not this is more a diatribe on stalin and his motivations decisions loneliness promotions of lackeys etc using the persona of ivan than any true historical record of ivan also note the obvious use of particular colours in the sequel red for the ussr in the banquet scene and perhaps blue for the usa during certain shots when the usurper wears the crownbut it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows or the exterior shot of the populace coming to beg ivans return to moscow
1,its so uncommon to find a film that provides a plot that cant be envision out at every turn surprisal throughout delighting throughouta distich of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead distaff character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an asocial risk taker that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did founder me pausethe other thing i could not get was the old military personnel who was being haul away by the police at the very end of the film i never did get who he was or what his go forth were if anyone has any ideas id like to hear what they might bethe film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guesswork very a great deal charles frederick worth assure

1,i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville kentucky when i was a boy the scene where dr carmus finds the gardeners coffin and the breathing dead body therein was the scariest part of the movie for me only intensified by the darkness of the film i also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers

1,this is one of my all time favourite movies if ur not into cars then forget it this movie features of aussies greatest muscle cars the xygtho yeah so the acting not the greatest it was never made to win an oscar the car action will keep you comin back for more and more there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the s and an awesome chev with a real cool cat drivin it also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this movie big fast cars with pleantly of steelno plastic cars and some cool street dragging i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting
0,this is arguably the worst film i have ever view and i have quite an appetite for nasty and good movies it could just have managed a kind of teenage witticism if it had been systematically tongueincheek la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from verboten space contend to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it await like they rounded up braindead teenagers and need them to adlib the whole production compared to them tom sail await like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle

0,robert altmans former downbeat newfangled western from edmund naughtons book mccabe was overlooked at the office time of its release but histrion in the past years has garnered a sterling critical program line following aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the characters here dont merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally brackish and unappealing bearded warren beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in licking preceding struggling community unlikable on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first altogether brothel visualise henry m robert once the profits start coming in beatty frozen is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the new audience a certain sense of time and histrion place but the action in this equal sorry little town is limitedmost of the story being made up of vignettesand altmans pacing is deliberately slow theres hardly a statement being made just the opposite in fact and the languid actors atomic number stare at each other without much on their minds its a selfdefeating picture and yet in an altmanquirky way it cathouse wears clothing defeat proudly from

0,this movie started fit out as a quite decentlooking film but it never verboten really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made nifty it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite gain slow it didnt manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its static not scary at all or so its supposed to be a horror movie but there wasnt a single scene information technology that was close to frightening or even excitingto number be frank the actors werent all that great rather either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysoverall a watchable movie but it doesnt add anything and once youve finished just watching information technology it it wont last long groovy until its already forgottenthe reason i watched it was because i fit had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it out of if dumb you beaver state still want some japanese horror i shut down would suggest you watch juon instead

1,henry thomas and robin tunny are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business its beyond me as to why they havent received more recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities areacting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality and if these characters aint odd im at a loss to find anyone who isthe story is funny romantic dramatic complicated and tragic i hated the ending but if i hadnt i wouldnt have loved the story as a whole so there ya go
0,jeux denfants or how the film was wrong translated into english have sex me if you dare is a film made by stupid mass and about stupid mass i just dont know how i could look something worth a look from a film with such plot two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something certainly extremely idiotic to prove to each other wtf that they are cool dudes i know that i magnify some aspects but that is what the total film is about they grow olderand instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alien looney continue to execute their crazy thing thinking that they are slap up peopleone could look such a film from hollywood but france it is still more offensive to watch the film from the body politic which created amelie a couple of years ago which btw the film seek to look corresponding but is alir extremely alir away fromavoid avoid avoid

1,chuck joness beep beep so telephone despite the fact that the route runner understandably says meep meep is the second of the exceptionally popular route runner serial publication and is a vast advance on its predecessor the historically important but lustreless fast and furryous while it features various predictable quickfire gags beep beep too dilate on that initial cartoon with more ambitious longer sequences honcho among these is a fantastic extended chase through an old mine in which we see the coyote and the route runner interpret by two small lights theres too a very curious longer gag demand some rocketpowered rollerskates beep beep too sees a great advance in the representation of wile e coyote not only does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype in fast and furryous but he too draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater sum of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of imminent pain sensation although its a little wearisome to get going too many lingering shots of pattern hinder the pace in some of the early gags once beep beep get in at the mine ray sequence its absolved that jones was origin to get a tangible deal on these eccentric and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them there are dependable route runner cartoons than beep beep but theres a tangible feeling of triumph about this cartoon as if it were the confirmation that there was a serial publication to be milked out of this scenario
1,this film is an absolute classic for camp that is celluloid why helium it was an elvira and mst classic washington everyone knows the story scientist keeps his girlfriends head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he verboten in truth cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local simple chicks finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scarfaced chicks head on top the severed head meter makes friends with the failed experiment tick in the closet and the conehead comes equal out of in truth the closet and rips off the assistants remaining good arm his other is not right from a scientists earlier failure and equal the whole place burns downthe movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldnt go into his basement for a year after seeing it as kids we ranked the numeral scariest movies of all slant time and this one was number four only one murder of those classical scary movies was really any good the original the hauntingi had to give this match movie a seven rating office for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist gird looks for alert the bodies complete with porno sound track scares the hell subsequently out of innocent children while the ridiculous aspects make physical structure it prime material for watching talking and laughing motion picture show i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it helium while id rather go to the dentist than watch chicago againseven is the most i can give it because its entertainment value is mere luck the film as cinema is vista a disaster
1,financially strapped paramount pulled out all the stops for this stage adaptation entry big budget large cast extravagant production and mitch leisen tagged as the director what happened two things busby berkeley didnt work for the outof focus rock and a murder mystery script that didnt deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst charlie chan first draft down the street i have to believe that the cutting was out of leisens hands since the great duke ellingtons number is savagely chopped but that doesnt mean that it aint worth a look the isweet marihuana number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing toby wing whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied jack oakie carl brissons acting is bland as melba toast but hes a competent singer maclaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective and try to spot lucy in the chorus this rates a as a curiosity feb rethink i recently gave the film another look and now feel i was wrong to berate the lack of busby berkeley production numbers i can understand leisens argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot i still have enormous issues with the editing however paramount the raciest major studio in town faced huge issues with the production code at the worst possible time in its history financially speaking and pulled out all the stops on this one also check out s search for beauty a must see for precode buffs
0,its a real big bummer people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility if you see movies this its a big shame and its big shame if people like hp lovecraft get by the likes of this i rented this movie cuz the drop hp lovecraft on it and im a big of many his adaptions mainly those done by brian yuzna gordon this movie has nothing to deliver a cheap scenery on a beach and an old winecellar digicam effect red light over the whole movie no actors just some stupid lowgrade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing stiff as wood and so must be the director its obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is so laughable it just work and goreeffects just some blood in a you drink you become demon and dropping here and there oh yeah the story thousands of ago some big old colonised the world and took humans as then mankind got independent so the old ones tried to destroy them and now there are survivors in a postapocalyptic world the only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon thats where it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their and in their winecellar unbelievable the whole thing but as it is dubbed german title des jenseits and you can find it in most commercial videostores seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this fact impressive
1,this is the first out of that ive given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action there isnt any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that doesnt try to please all sectors of the public ie theres no forced romancei liked the first two bourne movies but i loved this onewarning after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car
0,obviously influenced by the success of pals destination moon and lipperts rocketship xm this one just doesnt make the cut limited special effects a thin story line result in a production that even the halfdecent cast cant save just no believability here no one seems surprised to encounter martians much like earthlings etc etc pass on it
0,the core is strong cast has given it their best shot the packaging is excellent but the screenplay is seriously overdramatized and every cliche in the on womens suffering in india overused to the max

0,the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the titlei honestly didnt like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i dont get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however its visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noisesthe movies storyline is very simple most of whats going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cutsi will say openly that this movie didnt meet my expetations a tiny bit
0,what else is left to sayive read all the reviews here and most are right on however one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it or something along those lines evil wow what a shocker i mean tbn basically made this film open your eyes pleaseanway this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in yearsthe most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it if this movie can be made there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to get ready for yentl and ernest loses the omega codesfor those of you who are into the biblical stories the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started
1,although this was a film of only less than forty minutes it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever seen it accomplishes in less than minutes what most films cannot in more than it is the story of two brothers one and the other they come from a poor farm family in mississippi both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of familyit brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behindi can fully recommend this film as beyond superb

0,what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itazjazz

1,the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and ive seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are what really made it for me cristina rainess father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine its your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think its one of the better ones out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfiedperformances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part shes beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldnt help but love him martin balsamjos ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli wallachchristopher wlaken do well as the bumbling detectives beverly dangelo has one chilling scene that i wont spoilbottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look
0,no im not kidding if they ever propose a movie idea they should be kicked out of the studio im serious their movies are exactly the same in every one and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they easily resolve hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends think about it if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these movies are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters im sure that when they were really young and made some ok movies some studio boss bought all their rights for years or something so that now that theyre what they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studios money let me advise you stay away from marykate and ashley its for your own good
0,had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend who like me fan of the first movie down right sucked it lacked magic of the first you could understand word the mice said the animation is crappy the palace much different from the first movie theres new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible luckily the prince didnt have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid basically its like the lion king except its different stories all told by the mice the reason im giving a out of is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable
1,i just want to say that i am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie bravo the spaz bravo this movie is a ridiculous farce of filmmaking especially for a student film i just want to give credit to the spazz for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture and then to comment on it most people i know dont have that kind of time especially so few will end of reading it kudos to you sir anyway the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly i understand the idea behind creating a satire of charlies angels but why hire such atrocious actresses also what kind of director has himself act write produce and also edit the picture choose one job and put all your love into it man its such a shame because i hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush again thanks to the spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film people like you are a rare find
1,this is a film about loneliness and how the distance physical and emotional between people tends to stultify relationshipsthe narrative is simple to the point of banality a young man yusuf emin toprak from a rural village arrives in istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin mahmut muzaffer ozdemir yusuf wants work in the big city after trying for a few weeks to find work without any success the strain of having yusuf living with him is too much for mahmut they quarrel nothing physical just verbal eventually yusuf goes leaving mahmut alone again end of storyexcept for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film much is said visually dialog is used to bring out disagreement distrust hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two menthere are many visual gems in this film for example while searching for work young yusuf needing a relationship tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city the look on his face as he is thwarted every time says it allor wanting a cigarette yusuf opens the door to the balcony of mahmuts apartment and lights up in the frigid december air leaving the door open mahmut eventually gets up from his work desk walks to the door all glass and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time then mahmut closes the door leaving yusuf out in the cold the metaphor is completeor mahmut cleaning up after yusuf grudgingly and with increasing anger and all the while yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work and spends mahmuts money on a toy for a nephew yusuf is emotional untidy impulsive and vulnerable mahmut is rational logical selfconfident and a demanding control freak the rightbrain leftbrain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look a gesture a frown than any words can conveybut mahmut is not completely emotionless he still loves his exwife who tells him that shes off to canada with her husbandtobe mahmut affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex and makes sure that she is okay about going he wishes her well he says goodbye he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking later when she calls to say a last goodbye on the way to the airport mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves the poignancy of the emotion on his face as she disappears through a door is worth the waitall in all this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director nuri ceylan some might argue that the pace is too slow but life goes slowly for much of the time especially for those who are alone the camera work is relatively simple also choose the scene set up the camera and lighting and let the actors move across the scene enter the scene and leave the scene all the while keeping the camera still there were a few panning shots some highangle tracking shots a few rural scenes but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens except for tv and radio music within the story there is no music sound track and there are those many long silences as the two men sit and watch tv together andor engage in very limited conversationi saw this movie on tv so i was amused to see that on a few occasions i was watching tv as they were watching tv also the silence in the movie matched the silence in my house i was awake all others in bed my chair and position matched that of mahmuts as he watched tv quite eerie giving me a sense of almost being there with him and i guess i was in a senseill say no more because i want you to savor the other scenes that i havent described its not a movie for everybody for sure more than any movie ive seen it shows just how much we die when we are all alone just as we are all alone when we die mahmuts face as it fades to black in the final scene will stay with me for a long long timehighly recommended for serious movie buffs
1,the opening shot of the consequences of love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film a travellator slowly carries a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera trailing a huge suitcase behind him like the central character in the film we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him his profession the contents of the suitcase could be way off the markconsequences of love is that kind of film from the title you might expect a bergmanesq dissection of a relationship what we have instead is a lead character titta living life in emotional exile seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him if the film can be classified in any way i would call it a mystery as we are engaged in working out who titta is and what he is about what we know from the start is he is ish cool composed and expensively attired he has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking swiss hotel always paying his room fee on time but seldom showing any interest in the staff or other guestshis only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with the couple it transpires used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have only the room they live in left their love of money antiques and each other was their undoing and titta seems to identify with their plight he once had it all but now is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel his brother a long haired surf instructor drops in to see him occasionally but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure they talk about the person titta considers to be his best friend even though he hasnt seen him for years this long lost friend is now a telephone engineer repairing the communication network that brings so many together meanwhile tittas phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to speak to himmidway through the film titta makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up to a young barmaid from the hotel with his judgement clouded by emotion he sets himself on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for goodthe slow unfolding of tittas fall from grace is and beautifully scripted shot and scored the thumping techno soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more secrets are revealed the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as titta lets his mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions the ending with a visual nod to felini is dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the audience to once more question his motivespatrick bliss
0,again were getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films the good and the bad son story courtesy east of eden the american marine hero story who doesnt consider himself to be one due to what he knows and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man storythe mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isnt so much of a problem though because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around no luck this time though as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the sameas the bad son never really gets to talk to his father so that conflict is never resolved properly apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife now how satisfying is thatnext the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved because he never really talks to the man under suspicion namely his own brother so once more were handed a loose end hereand finally the american military heroism hypocrisy theme where the marine is publicly considered a hero when due to the dirtiness of war he went through he shouldnt really be called one as to his own standards that third theme falls flat just the same because the movie ends right when for the first time hes just able to talk to his wife about what he went through where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely his process of recovery how that would look like and how he would finally face the family hed have some major guilt to admit to all that all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignoredso while story wise this film is a serious and i mean serious disappointment id still give it points for the impressive cast although no film should use maguire for a voice over because that belongs to spiderman especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor so much that id in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profileso while the cast really seems to do what they can i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise a shallow and ultimately pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed message du jour to the writers we know the wounds already see the host of vietnam films you want to earn some credit show us a believable healing
0,i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didnt its one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone sepiatoned imagery pretentious title no sex and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfxcgi so that we the stupid audience get it one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong instead they call the nobelprice named after an actual person called alfred nobel the nobleprice jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron
0,this is a movie that was the made just entertain the middle school early high school age kids maybe to them its funny they may possibly even see something i in times to me and acting is poor probably plot is poor theres just not this value at all for the adult viewer at at this film as weak and boring at it there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting really it never horror or the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds they dont seem to have any that other than the look scary times i wasnt sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy materialized was it to another attempt saw but substance failed again much movie just wasnt good for me
1,this is one of the best movie i have ever seen my parents comes from rural india and to some extend i have seen the life of the villagers peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems the movie just reflects exactly the same full credit to the director and the actor they have done an excellent job i just wonder how can movies like lagaan and paheli can go for oscar and not doghi i dont understand the criteria on which the movies are selected is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the differencehope to see more movies like this in the future
1,this is an enjoyable project that is not a film as the title suggests good performance by nadia dajani who reenacts the role of grace i follows the reenactment of what happens to mike and grace in new york city she leaves but he wants to get in contact with her this project is his way of trying to getting in touch with heri saw it on ifc i have heard that it will be released on dvd as well i do like this trend of more independent projects this is an example of a good projecti hope that he finds hertake a look and be entertainedkirbyef
0,the biggest problem with in search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to it at all shicksunn produced these documentary films in the s and just into the s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in onsadly historic jesus is really little more than a thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more superior in search of noahs ark which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is given much screen timefor fans of these quasidocumentary films like jupiter menace and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesnt offer much

1,displays his developed understanding for visuals this early film the plot of the film two boxers fighting over a girl straightforward drama much to it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has us all we need to know the boxing scenes handled well with some interesting pointofview that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven money and lust reason or love only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early and his development as a storyteller
0,ive read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film i cant say that i found much to recommend it the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively heavyhanded but dreary beyond measure the film looks authentic enough but somethings got to happen for it to work and nothing much does a cursory plot not a real problem for me not much character development nothing thematically it just slogs along flawed as it is ciminos heavens gate has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film id sooner watch again for a brilliant reconception of the west hbos deadwood is much superior to mccabe
1,its rare that i sit down in front of the tv arrive specifically to watch a particular programme its even rarer when i actually enjoy pronounce the programme in the end but last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best book movies maam i think book ive seena remarkable cast led by dame judi dench and ian program holm tv and an excellent witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience i suppose cant really express how good i thought it was so i wont try ill just say if you get the opportunity washington please see it i only hope it comes out on picky video

1,this is on my top list of alltime favourite films it is a fantastic and insightful film it was historically interesting and great to watch i thought the acting from emily blunt was fantastic and rupert friend was a fantastic albert the best actor was chosen for albert the costumes were gorgeous and the settings and scenes such as the opera house were amazing and detailed i just loved it all of it i loved the childhood scenes were shes getting bullied by john conroy and where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult one again the writers have done it they produced this fantastic script it thoroughly deserves the awards they got oscar and bafta wining sandy powell for costume design a bafta for best makeup and hair an oscar in best achievement in art direction best achievement in costume design best achievement in makeup broadcast film critics association awards for best costume design also nominated for best actress emily blunt cdg for excellence in costume design for film period hamptons international film awards for an audience award for best narrative film pfcs for best costume designsudbury cinefest doesnt say what for vfcc for best actress emily blunt overall wins and nominations that pretty good have a look yourself its really interesting personally rupert friend should have got an award
1,heres what i knew about atlantis before watching it its officially disneys first animated scifi adventure im not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it described the preview looked for the most part damn cool evidently it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the fact it apparently did so badly that disney said screw it lets rerelease ispy kidsso with all that said how is the moviehellacoolim a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway but atlantis goes all out its a throwback to all the cgi eyecandy shots in beauty and the beast and aladdin so much so that its almost an effects animators bestof show the characters maybe arent that memorable except perhaps for the ships medical officer and the plots a little dull but this isnt a movie you watch for the plotheres a controversy that bothers me the failure as in it only took in like fivehundredmillion or something i know animators whod kill to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation i dont think thats true how do you account for the south park movie what about final fantasy really the story and the artistry is everything not the method i dont know what disneys comeback movie will be like but i dont think theyre out of the picture yet
1,its one the best movies that i have seen this year i agree with the person who said its boring of course some people may find this movie not at all but personally i spent a very good moment movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes there is also a nice touch of humor for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father then her husband says how can someone abuse you and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games d very funny i recommend movie to everyone by the way sorry for my poor english im from
0,i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violencethree tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first minutes that alone didnt sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first timesthere was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like a minute boys brief short rather than a fleshed out fulllength film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its partsthe st part boxerstalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their catmouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lotlocker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want the nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he jacksoff tony doesnt seem to mind but he doesnt even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the allimportant transition from im a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be gay and hitting him because id like to spread his ass and do him sm style a very important thing to leave outclearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time the rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the makeup bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent showthere wasnt enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic the film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously
1,dont know what film or version jeff saw but this entire film was awesome not just poitier and going the story was riveting suspenseful and engaging and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory as a rule they did not patrol but exercised warrants on criminals only i did find it odd that corby didnt seem to have any indian friends i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange even as corby returned to his people his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless
0,this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitive to nurse older kids the message of the film about dealing with loss is subverted by the return of the young fille father during the moving picture show recognition team rocket provide some amusement but theyre not really part of the pocket size plot so they dont appear very often
0,its unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases ie anger at the gay characters thinking french thrillers are bad etc i will admit that im unfamiliar with the novel but as a film after about minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the hours of its running length hours that felt like dont get me wrong i can sit through hour and a half silent films hour epics i dont have a short attention span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery list of complaints first off the ending yes it had a scoobydooesquire character explains everything at the end now i actually think for this movie this was necessary the film had so many plottwists emotional revelations new facts surfacing and being discovered one reviewer said it well yes it is a very logical story but without the very essential back story their childhood stories the relationship amongst the parents the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man it just doesnt feel right i felt cheated i wont throw in too many spoilers here i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary but according to the reviews on here theres a lot of people who seem to really love this so i dont want to give anything away i personally cant stand soap operas the complexity and twists and turns for me snuffed out any impact the final revelations could possibly deliver by the end i seriously didnt care there werent any gaping plot holes necessarily this seems like it could make a great book in writing it is perfectly logical but if im supposed to believe this is reality something doesnt sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted too often i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot increase the emotion and develop the mystery the acting i had no complaints about the directing eh not bad but the plot and especially its development severely lacking sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller but i couldnt get into it i gave this a simply because i dont want to seem completely unfair and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement major spoiler and i have to mention it but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldnt fit in another twist your father didnt die in a hunting accident i almost died when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasnt enough does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as much as ive ever been bothered in any film
1,if you like whodunits you will like this film considered the best italian detective story giallo fulci has doneits not mickey spillane for sure there are scenes designed to disturb anyonemany would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a yearold boy she was joking but she was naked nonetheless and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones she also tries to tempt the local priestyoung boys are turning up missing and there are several interesting suspects you have to watch carefully to discover the killer can you dont jump on the first guy its way too early and he is too obviousanyone familiar with fulci will be able to guess the killer who died a violent death at the end what crazy reasoning he had

0,at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles setthe plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of thingsor just a lot was edited from the movie the characters identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didnt seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the moviei suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they hadif they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didnt so now theres a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opiniondont waste your time or money

1,cinemas greatest period started in postwar europe with italys neorealist movement during the next or decades that followed frances new wavers caught everyones attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in luchino visconti brought the artform to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work death in venice which might as well be called the death of europoean cinema after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats coppola scorsese co this movie absolutely feels like a grand summingup not just of viscontis particular obsessions but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the visconti revealed here hes not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmoswe will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the centurys great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background gustav mahlers th symphony taking full advantage of mahlers ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies its a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpsecinema just doesnt get better than this ill ignore the complaints from the ritalinaddicts out there who say that its too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbachs flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movies thematic concerns ie which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what its mostly about is suffering romantic capital r suffering in particular as a suffering romantic himself visconti knew whereof he spokespoiler i guess if for nothing else see death in venice for its portentous opening credits and for its unforgettable ending with bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the object of bogardes dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty death in venice is a miraculous work of art dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie its ostensibly in english but the dvds sound seems muddy and theres a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway

0,this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school early high school age kids maybe to them its funny they may possibly even see something scary in it to me the acting is poor and plot is poor theres just not much value at all for the adult viewer i saw this film as weak and boring at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds they dont seem to have any substance other than the look at times i wasnt sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again this movie just wasnt good for me

1,adapting his own novel cabal for the screen author screenwriter director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story of outr horror and fantasy craig sheffer plays boone a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer the cops gun him down in front of midian on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society when they lay claim to boone and make him one of their own this causes repercussions for everybody including boones sweet girlfriend the very cute anne bobby and dubious psychiatrist a most enjoyable david cronenbergnightbreed displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that i dont see in movies all that often for one thing ralph mcquarrie an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three star wars entries helps barker to create excellent visuals for nightbreed starting right away with the opening credit sequence the visual and makeup effects are elaborate and production design and cinematography quite impressive barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters its colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in and of course theres the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a persons actionsgreat supporting performances add to the fun cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor while charles haid is a fine lovetohatehim type of antagonist a rather nasty police captain doug pinhead bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary lylesberg and is solid as a rock hugh ross is great fun as narcisse as is catherine chevalier as rachel as an added bonus she bares her breasts in one sequence simon bamford who played the butterball cenobite in the first two hellraiser pictures turns up here as well theres even a cool cameo by s and s scifi star john agardanny elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores and barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdownnightbreed is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasnt seen it i give it a hearty recommendation
0,when i first heard about this movie i eagerly went out to rent it believing mistakenly that it was one of those sobaditsfun movies and that i was in for a treat i was wrongfor starters the pace is agonizingly mindnumbingly slow the pace doesnt even begin to pick up until the last minutes of the movie the plot was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing for those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwisetry childs play instead
0,to see movie hoping see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon too of fight stunts are so clearly fake that it even enjoyment out of it the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldnt see wires holding him up as he flies through the air for seconds and cartoonish and very disappointing
1,i have waited for long time ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice amendment was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale understand of register mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by amp the or so amendments made by the roleplay adaptor the level equal of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper gravely and equal helen cherry gain all perform beautifully but its plainly my opinion that the show is or so stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know amp if you agree with my lease words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and just enjoy

1,the team of merian cooper and ernest schoedsack a documentary of bakhtiari people and their animals on summer migration to winter grazing the basic worth of this today as a time capsule of a forgotten and how lived during what we in the west knew as the roaring twenties a more drastic contrast could not be imagined raging river and barefoot are brutally realistic the that under the water do in fact die to make sure that audience of the time believed that the story took place a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end the version that i saw had fascinating iranian music that stand alone and be without the film having all this the film is probably of more value to the the casual viewer in search of a good entertainment the crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the and no fancy camera work resulting from multiple retakes the western intertitles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would appreciated by the audience of the day entertainment by desert police becomes a policemans ball the producers went to make the docudrama chang and the totally commercial kong the migration theme is used again in people of wind and in himalaya recommended for those who know in advance what they are into and highly recommended for them
0,well ok ive seen wrath of the ninjait isnt something that i would recommend to people who arent seriously into japanese fighting movies this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie with a complex plot its about these old ninja schools that had these swords of sorcery i saw the subtitled version not recommended by the way its easy to miss something and i didnt really keep up with it all it had some good scenes tough but in general it wasnt much to my liking
0,so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule the political motives behind each one the reasons behind belgiums decision to give the drc its independence and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing familiarity with the story of the drcs fight for freedom saw a story filled with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them out with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so its all the sadder because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history whatever the reason the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentencelong statements and facts printed on the screen the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main idea of whats going on completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things for instance there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with lumumba one that vilifies lumumba and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying orders correspondingly there are three soldiers that speak in the scene uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view then to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and thats that theres little telling through actions even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness its hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also in the trend of this directness things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact we never learn what these factions are what theyre fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the characters likewise are onedimensional and flat unfortunately i dont know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didnt trust it to tell me so the drc like many developing countries has a complicated and important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines
0,this is seriously the worst movie i have ever seen right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score poor acting and total lack or real story or plot even for a b movie this is down right awful after reading some of the good reviews i thought id keep an open mind and watch it but all the bad reviews were so right i totally cant understand how anyone could have enjoyed it im a huge scifi fan and this was way more than i could swallow definlty do yourself a favor a move on to a different movie they are many other better movies that deal with this subject matter you have been warned
1,abc has done more solid this show by of after veterans james in circumstances david spade to join the cast of garner predictable at first the show was watchable and even show with john ritter and katey sagal johns loss shocked the world katey and the three kids are really a for professional cast the hour lesson television johns death this reallife struck home to pain i lost my father at years old and could allowing and understand their me and show abc should be proud to maintain this agony and even preserve this as johns final wish this show has matured and developed because sympathize such impossible and they should be rewarded with emmys
0,if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable im from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment
1,i watch a lot of movies a lot of movies getting a graduate degree in film forces one to watch flicks a day for years it all gets very exhausting mostly because i feel i have seen it all so rare is it when i get surprised by something mostly i hope to see something as good as i expect it to bedeath bed is so unlike anything i have ever experienced i actually had to stop the dvd in order to rant about its geniusthe rhythm of the piece is psychotic its structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside of the frame its not like something like halloween with all its snappy editing and pov shots death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy the most pretentious way i can phrase it is this is samuel beckett making a haunted house movie i mean its a manic depressive bed that eats people and fried chicken out in the middle of nowhere and theres bone hands i can barely articulate my feelings about this film and yeah copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule but things get real samey after awhile its hard to be a cinephile and consistently stay engaged i can honestly say this is a fully unique film up and down from what it is to how its put together we need films like that movies that shake us out of our complacency consider it like existential camp its fun and its stupid but also brilliant in its weird little way the worst horror villain of all time maybe but at least it isnt a guy in a mask
1,bad script bad direction over the performances top overwrought dialogue ray more could you ask for for combined it just doesnt get any better than this zadoras as laughs with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an tap parody of the spinal machine almost as funny not hollywood hilarious even though it was clearly overacting intended as such dont miss what liottas debut film line looks like a penis
0,id never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is more entertaining than this s era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high octane cop shows such as csi csi miami and so forth im not saying all these shows are bad but they arent good either i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypescountertypes thats right stereotypescountertypes unfortunately this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in gothpunk clothing and they start harassing him now this is exactly what middle america perceives the gothpunk culture i mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot its always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood okay not everyone whos a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what middle red state america sees of these people finally why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick cant you make the sidekick an equal asskicker
1,says andy nobody gets hurt everybody wins before he says it we know the opposite is true everybody gets hurt nobody wins this is a new strand in american movies or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last think eastern promises there will be blood no country for old men these movies are dark serious extremely well made and dont care about happy endings i love them before the devil knows youre dead fits the general description but creates an atmosphere all its own kelly mastersons debut script is as close as a hollywood movie will ever get to a greek tragedy paying tribute to fellow veteran director stanley donen sidney lumet expertly and soberly turns the sombre story into an outstanding old school character drama the opening shots although of an obese accountant doggystyling his trophy wife have the look and feel of a dutch masters painting by contrast the drug dealers condo looks more like a string of mondrians great performances all around only albert finneys character charles feels a little overacted eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time but then he is in trouble deep deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know for compensation marisa tomei is super hot but of course you dont need me to tell you that why her character gina would want to be with a guy like andy were never told but thats okay action is character after all the unique and magic touch of carter burwells music makes this fine movie a masterpiece dont miss it
0,as a southerly baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly arent so many that i want to discourage filmmakers from a genre thats sadly underexploited still i must honestly state that loves abiding joy is a typically low budget low key selfconsciously christian film the plat is predictable the acting middling im being kind and the editing horrifying as a tv movie it might have been more or less above average but as a feature film it result much to be desired keep try guys youve draw to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or coke s carl lewis for some inspiration

0,too predictable for spoilers but ill not be cagey below so dont read it if you carea few dull scriptwriters together for half an afternoon and even then they run out of ideas so lets start with a criminal sought by all francedoesnt matter what he has done well think of that later they dont some seconds of suspense but not too much and nothing unexpected because that requires art half an hour needed to finish off the film i get it have them rob a jewellers and take a lot of time avoiding alarms etc everybody robs jewellers in films just ike this its bound to work it doesnt no humour no character ok yves montand does get to ham it a weeny bit and have everyone speak in a quiet deadpan voice that is supposed to make one think of noir but merely makes the actors sound depressed if they are silent itll make them seem grimmer but also save us writing their lines wed better add something for the stay at home women who are going to watch this stuff so lets have something to make them empathise with hubby we forgot to put any women in the film got it a son on gasp marijuana oh and have him attempt suicide for no particular reason shame his dads a mafia boss for crying out loud but the audience will feel his fatherly care and if not sod them oh the crooked cop was a classmate of the guy who gets him in the end wrenching eh lets have them all die at the end or well never finish this stuff is it in the can right thats over with then thank god wholl we get for director
1,although this was a flick of only to a lesser extent than forty transactions it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever attend it accomplishes in to a lesser extent than transactions what most movie cannot in more than it is the story of two brothers one and the other they come from a poor farm family in ms both are take in up in war and the conflict of duty versify love of familyit get tears to my optic especially because the entire flick is so well acted and directed addition it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behindi can fully recommend this flick as beyond superb
0,fulci experiments with sci fi usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore but not here sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for minutes and if they they are electecuted guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who to hold anyway lift him the floor the city is an obvious but a bad the end explosion is at best and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes

1,for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience okay you dont need to read any further nowi already guess most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture so i should say ponyo is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child discovering the world as you wanted to see it making up your own rules and boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time ponyo swerves away from many of the problems that allage films tackle it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problemsthe two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen they are not simple minded arrogant or naive just curious enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with many films regard children from the outside as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter ponyo brings everyone back to that world in ponyo there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most which the film values with high esteem it is worth it to remember to feel it again
1,a hugely enjoyable screen version of rona jaffes bestselling potboiler about the trials and tribulations and naturally the loves of a group of women involved in one way or another in the new york publishing business directed by jean negulesco fairly fresh from the success of three coins in a fountain and the prototype for the likes of sex and the city except that here the sex all takes place offscreenthe bright young female talents of the day hope lange diane baker suzy parker martha hyer are all nicely cast while joan crawford pops up as a queen bitch of an editor who could probably eat meryl streeps miranda priestly and spit her out with absolutely no effort at all she steals the movie the men include stephen boyd louis jourdan if it wasnt rossano brazzi it had to be louis jourdan robert evans before he decided wisely to go behind the camera and brian aherne there are more suds on display than you will find in your average launderette but if like me you enjoy desperate housewives not to mention carrie bradshaw and company then you will probably love this a very guilty pleasure

1,this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who arent really conformist movie pickers dont get me wrong there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it you know youre either a tween or dont really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find a good movie thats not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos a great film not to be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a must buy
1,midnight cowboy is not for everybody its raw painful and realistic but very entertaining the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances voight as the texas hustler joe buck who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women sadly buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas he was raised by his grandmother sally buck played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in from cancer the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and bucks characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job as the film evolves bucks past comes to the surface and its haunting but not clear the film is not for children but compared to todays films and television programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i cant forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you cant forget its also a tearjerker of a film so get your hankies out too
1,story this is one of my all time favoritesif the movie has a flaw its that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesnt so much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewers imaginationmoroders riptide languorous synthpop fits the action to amp a tee teeing ground like a great deal the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails riptide and gnashes broods and tugs amp a constant reminder of tonys inexorable capone fatenot so much accommodate a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable equal force of a runaway train

0,ok take over so its a silly movie but i think they shopworn knew that when they just at that place made it and there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired overdone godzillatype genre borrowed a tape just because i knew someone amp in it but i did loan it out to a couple pals who also kinda liked it
0,this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb nazis occult government conspiracies i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awfulpart of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeaus character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid she just doesnt do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter siri barucanother big part is the pacing it starts off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focusedthe real problem is its simply not a pleasant movie to watch its slow dull none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery and sets some movies you see characters get tortured in this its the viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome
1,i was surprised once more my darling had not generated enough votes at this writing for a user rating its a screwy comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years robert montgomerys mission places him in some very improbable situations and hes just the man for the job he maintains his trademark befuddled look throughout the film and hysterically too ann blyth plays his precociouseccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname killer but remains cute and cuddlyamong the glut of b movies from the late s and s once more my darling is a standout this one is worth looking for
1,the movie parts a really way combinedbut one which is great and looking and a directed you can tell that every shot is thought one and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially to true watch and they cinema should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for especially that is being put into itits hard a as this movie under gets label its not really of drama its made more a thriller and its not really a comedy of its more a movie with its features style make does things its own well over doesnt necessarily follow for rules instead cinema and features many different elements from many different genres not just like the movie its main character the movie artistic sort a slow and boring in parts the the style of directing also to conceal mustsee the story is actually passionately quite simple one and its really as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt that the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a film absolute that in parts the movie great feels place if its trying to be too poetic and tries to storytelling the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in is though it most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit own some great camerawork and some unique let which makes this an original as well as a great tries to watch
1,i think this film has much to recommend it particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a than passable performance by the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very very hard follow in some all in it makes for a nice time in front the tube
1,full house was and still is a great show its a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show there really arent any shows like it anymore the kids are very cute and even though its a bit cheesy its still good especially for anyone who watched it when they were a kid i would love to see the cast interviewed now anyone that would like to see interviews of the cast kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special features of the dvd should go to the petition spot website and sign a petition titled full house reunion on dvd as there is a petition for this in hopes that the cast may want to do it yay for full house

0,highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent spanish production aboutwell let me see just how close i can get to it the film opens with a woman having one of her cats killed by a young girl she then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this what relevance this plays out to is anybodys guess at the films end because the guy a swarthy photographer spies a beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment to witches mountain for reasons again we are never privy to before they go patty must stop by the house and loud eerie chanting echoes in our heros ears again this is never explained the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn going on to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors are really quite goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman the leads are at least adequate and the climax though it makes absolutely no sense at all is wellchoreographedliterally with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair it just doesnt make any sense though and that is a huge detractor to me i could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing that is a major problem the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can get more out of it than me better power to you
1,many films attempt the ambitious few succeed this film is one of themthough billed as a black comedy that term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind max and grace multihyphenate michael parness has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotion quite a remarkable feat to be certainwhile the comedic aspects are certainly present the heart of the film lies in its leads david krumholtz and natasha lyonne the delicate balance of the film really crazy versus real love falls to them and they achieve it carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming ending david krumholtz in the titular lead role and as narrator anchors the picture and does an exceptional job we see the world through maxs eyes and krumholtz imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that one would not expect to be believable coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide there should be no doubt from this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles natasha lyonne might be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles the role of grace is expansive in scope requiring her to show both great rage and great tenderness sometimes within seconds of each other she manages to convince us of graces deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and maniathis is not a laugh a minute type of comedy so dont see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish think more dramedy than comedy there are some very dark moments as one would expect given the subject matter of suicidal individuals and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by emma adele galvin as maxs sister sis the most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name actors in supporting roles while lorraine bracco and david paymer lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate the institution where max and grace meet are the real treat guillermo diaz is a wanton scene stealer as the delightfully frenetic oddball hector ralf moeller as bruno acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal rosanna arquette fully inhabits the role of vera with the crass vitriol of an embittered truck stop waitress even her hardhearted character melts eventually as does everyone who is touched by maxs literally undying love for gracecan love conquer all might be the question behind the film and even though the realist within says no movies are about an escape from reality even if only for a few brief hours i recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens spending a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psycheseattle international film festival june
0,blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle kristin erickson is found wandering around covered in dogs blood her parents ely randy colton blanche leslie flemingmitchell own the ranch are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself is considered a danger to herself others ranch hand expriest miguel del zamora recognises isabelles symptoms as a possible case of possession when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it blanche calls priest jacob cameron daddo who is her other daughter claires madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he confirms miguels suspicions accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle an innocent girl freedirected by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism i kept asking the same question over over again why do i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total utter unashamed ripoff of the exorcist you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share theres the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past misdemeanours against others the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctors the priest with a troubled past the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different other than its total crap is that it tries to give all the characters some screen time tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but its so badly written acted it just ends up being boring the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the characters are poorly written fleshed out at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof theres a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at leastaccording to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on actual events yeah right actual events from that happened in a film called the exorcist this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest there isnt even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up theres a scene of a cut arm theres a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix thats about it theres surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breasts are seen one pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere a really amateurish feel to the whole film toowith a supposed budget of about i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly cheap throughout there are no special effects to speak of the production values are rock bottom the acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache a terrible accent he is better than thisblackwater valley exorcism is a complete ripoff of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic the makers are thirty five years too late anyway a total turkey from start to finish
1,paperhouse is the most moving and affecting film ive always seen often classed as a horror moving picture this i believe is a grave error some journo once called it the thinking persons nightmare on elm tree street and while i live with the logic of his finis i cant help but think its a tag that is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to certify theyre really not thinking at all in fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is believably a bad idea quite an simply paperhouse is thoroughgoing in every exquisite contingent and will always have a special place in my heart as someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional raze which may go some way to excuse why my comments are so unrelentingly spout to be honest i realise no apologia for this so if you feel my words are too syrupy for your taste stop reading now because theres more to come its so rare to recover a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of puerility and the skin to overcome the horrendous feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this tenuous sentence in our lives flush more unusual to recover child worker who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to realise it all work in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspire piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes a great deal to their ability to portray the sombre and alienation of puerility often overlooked in a seamless and win over way and yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studio and have somehow washy away add to all this an incredibly talented director claude bernard rose imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and stalk soundtrack youre always likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why i have such affection and kinship for this film that no measure of words can express
1,what is wherefore there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in sociable ethnical a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box about office success and still has not received the critical attention it exposure deserves amp poesy i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry amp smith with the burgeoning washington scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french inward new wavethey discussed poetry and have philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political adenylic acid lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in sexual check in extremely the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and amp portrays man as weak exposure in the novel face of love because run we as a culture are blinded by our sociable own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have burgeon almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his photo work seems to linger reference because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this initiative one is his most important

1,not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like farscape doesi know youngsters and years oldfans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this tv miniseries it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on tv character driven drama that could be from an australian soap opera yet in the same episode it has science fact fiction that would give even the hardiest trekkie a run for his money in the brainbender stakes wormhole theory time travel in true equational formmagnificent it embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose fromwith such a broad scope it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long but here is where farscape really comes into its own elementit succeeds where all others have failed especially the likes of star trek a universe with practically zero kaos element they ran out of ideas pretty quickly kept rehashing them over the course of seasons they manage to keep the audiences attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues i happened to see the pilot premiere in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever get the girl after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst i had to do a hour night shift and developed chronic insomniafarscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nightsdo yourself a favour watch the pilot and see what i meanfarscape comet

0,in all took me three to get through this movie although not total trash ive found a number to be more useful dedicate time to such as taking off fingernails with sandpaperthe actors involved have to feel the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do people wont really pay see either the notoriety you earn wont be the best for you personally but least the commercials get air timethe first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole definition but does have one good feature if your kids you about letting them watch rrated movies before want them to them down and pop this little gem in watch the whining stop and the tears

0,robert altmans downbeat newfangled western from edmund naughtons book mccabe was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the characters here dont merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally brackish and unappealing bearded warren beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel once the profits start coming in beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place but the action in this sorry little town is limitedmost of the story being made up of vignettesand altmans pacing is deliberately slow theres hardly a statement being made just the opposite in fact and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds its a selfdefeating picture and yet in an altmanquirky way it wears defeat proudly from
0,just when you think that youve seen the worst the zombie subgenre can offer along comes another budding romero and his team of notalent mates to prove you wrongive suffered the zombie bloodbath trilogy endured death valley the revenge of bloody bill sat semicomatose through the zombie diaries and laughed hysterically during zombie extreme pestilence and genuinely thought that amateur moviemaking could sink no lower however having just watched zombie planet a two hour long festering pile of drivel from writerdirector george bonilla i think i have found the ultimate in awful zombie moviesin this dreadfully amateurish effort which is part mad max and part dawn of the dead but all bad frank farhat stars as t k kane a tough fighter who kicks zombie ass for a hobby armed only with knives a machete some concussion grenades and what he obviously perceives to be a really mean glareafter a desperately unexciting opening sequence in which he takes on a horde of dodgy looking zombies kane teams up with a group of survivors who not only have to fend off attacks from the undead but must also must placate a gang of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area by searching for and handing over any valuables that they findof course kane isnt the type of man to take orders from a bunch of zgrade postapocalyptic bully boys and he sets about teaching the bad guys a lesson mostly by glowering at them in a threatening manner only pausing to periodically rescue pals from zombiesfeaturing awful acting from almost everyone involved a dreadful script laughable effects and shoddy production values there is virtually nothing in this film to make it worth a watch to be fair i quite like the basic premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular slimming drug that blocks cravings for carbohydrates we learn this when one character conveniently explains the backstory to kane who strangely has no idea what has happened but this is about the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole productioni have a certain amount of respect for anyone who manages to fund and make their own movie but when the results are this poor that respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing i wouldve kept this one under wraps if i had made it

0,when the puffy chair beckons beware of its soft colorful upholsterythe movie starts out quite well josh mark duplass and emily kathryn aselton are a boyfriendgirlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship an argument occurs one night and in order to make up josh asks emily to come along on a roadtrip to his fathers house where josh plans to deliver a purplish lazyboy recliner for his dads birthday emily accepts and along the way they pick up joshs flighty brother rhett rhett wilkins an amishlooking fellow more in touch with other peoples lives than his ownthe roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between josh and emily as well as a bitter feeling for the puffy chair it is initially very grubby and falling apart until josh convinces the original owner to refurbish it rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of emily and joshs problems is the lazyboy and sets it to the torch one night and thats the last we hear of the chair even though there are many minutes left in the filmthe big issue is that the title of the film is the puffy chair when it isnt the chair at all that takes centerstage it is josh and emilys doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another once the chair is destroyed theres never another mention of it even though they arrive at joshs parents place on his fathers birthday without a gift josh never mentions the chair nor does his father theres no connection between it and the lives of these people so why call the movie the puffy chair and why isnt there a tiein with it at the end bad scriptthe other annoying thing is that mark duplass brother jay duplass is not only the director but also the cameraman and not a very good nearly every scene has a rapid zoomin on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the cameras autofocus catches up and rights itself initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel but rapidly became unbearablethe acting in the film is accessible and entertaining all of the actorsactresses did fine jobs but the poor production quality stilted ending and lack of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems
1,i thought this was a splendid case for mandys bodacious bod if you dont expect anything else such as clever plot of ground twists and believable eccentric development you habit be disappointed view this a sports illustrated shoot whose eccentric goes more or less killing people especially those who threaten to come between her and her mommy suzanna arquette who patently doesnt want to play the sex kitten she leave that up to her daughtermandys brass is a little too thoroughgoing but her body is a over alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a thoroughgoing to ratio of waist to hips and splendidly configure legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knee joint to calves to ankle that is completely pleasing to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratioand no flat butt to boot which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with swerve everywhere demur in the chthonian cerebral hemisphere mandy might have used a body double in the behind shot of her recede her towel as she descended into the candlelit hot tub with her blindfold germanguy victim no but from all i could see from her bikini crack she had the butt for it and didnt penury a double to prove itmandys acting abilities had little to do with her depression of a psychotic mommys girl with the obvious titillating lesbian overtones her bisexual person nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german language guy no who besides happened to be her mothers lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise onedimensional imitation of juvenile female horniness conflict with pathological murderous impulses always by ho with the workforce the ultimate designate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reasonmandys ubernordic facial features coupled with her ubervoluptuous body could either be a blessing or a bane if mandy really wants to further her life history as an actress id advise her to swallow up herself fully in the latin spoken communication especially italian and spanish and maybe french people although i dont know if they would go for her typewrite but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek brass with her vida guerra body but maybe her brass is just a little too nordic and she has picture off too lots of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the s whose early fame in blame it on rio de janeiro was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the groundvambo drule
0,half the reviews were good so i took a chance for sure priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasnt much the whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time boogie nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry it could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy that they had minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger better decades ago in the early s
1,now this show looks wish most of the other shows of its type from the mid s but the only thing is about this one is that its different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little seize with teeth of dramatic event too i in person thought it was a full show i cant read why would they set off it the full thing is that the lover base of this show is calm down alive ever since up to datemy leslie townes hope is that the weber bring back the show or even do a movie which i bonk is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesnt hurt to dream doesnt itanyway i would recommend if you hadnt seen it to chance the dvd of all episodes because the eccentric are great the news report lines are full the comedy is full and well the whole show is just great
0,what else is left to sayive just read world health organization all the reviews here and most are right on however one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that hence satan tainted it or something along those lines evil wow a great deal what a hence shocker i mean tbn basically made this film open your eyes pleaseanway this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense information technology that has come along in yearsthe most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they on spent z to make it if this movie can be made novel there are no limits and hence therefore we have no world health organization choice but to get ready for yentl and ernest loses the omega codesfor those of you who are spend into the biblical stories the new movie dogma will pickup where exactly omega code never started
1,fun about barkers nightbreed that its the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with first addams family movie and much of tim work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barkerespecially is the performance cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as in classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the with an old mausoleum and rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy felt when you saw frankensteins monster burned in the windmill is the very center the moviethis isnt a masterpiece and even barker has done more and certainly more chilling work but its pure fun it looks great remains without mocking itself worth a look

1,and different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see with those who do will remember right but aurvg creates its own universe totally is fascinating in every way what it is about estrangement i in really up to the viewer but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect me dont continue more im it this this movie probably got to casting see it superb really hope the team behind this movie makes if movies he that as will know to do so believe their own some and weird style and i forgot the facades here i i but trond fausa movie being perfect in the role they the bothersome man who doesnt understand where and in what he is doing kinda why the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life is the city is what makes him bothersome all and others do as they are told the pretend to be happy this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in

1,one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema or indeed most anything done outside these holierthanthou united states are the permutations that crop up in postworld war two japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion the same thing happens in genre filmmaking as well though again im referring to movies made outside the u where were just too sophisticated in our closemindedness to appreciate anything that isnt about or by us would an american company for instance back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler el santo or a werewolf paul naschy or a reallife martial artist bruce lee as for television forget it while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine ive always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was how to put it kindly a bit lacking to this very day there hasnt been a payperview channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia there are lots of softcore porn masquerading as entertainment shows but the socalled action channel for instance has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc there was of all things at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery the deadly venoms in its own right as fascinating as any other genrebased whodunit western cop show etc this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work its now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve if youre a martial arts movie fan rejoice one of the greatest movie genres of all time specifically the martial arts movies of the s and early s are getting a longoverdue second life and greatly appreciated second look on dvd
1,shtrafbat penal battalion is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood world war two one almost call it the russian of highly acclaimed band of brothers miniseriesformed in july of on the eve of battle of stalingrad the penal battalions were considered expendable and suffered horrible casualties sometimes as high as prisoners of gulag political prisonconcentration camps deserters soldiers who captured by germans but managed to escape soldiers accused of breaching protocol were all given a chance to join the shtrafbat and prove that there were not traitors of the motherland with their lives those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of lawthis miniseries features a look at one shtrafbat under the command of tverdokhlebov an honorable officer who captured by the germans was shot and left for dead it features colorful and group of people thrust into a situation from which there is no escape the authoritative honorable crime antip kulak the fist and little gang of unreformed criminals a young jewish intellectual who struck his antisemite officer father orthodox priest mikhail who battalion when his parish is destroyed in the housetohouse fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to gulag but who are nonetheless to fight one time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons keep living and to keep on fightingalthough set during a war not every episode features combat in what combat scenes there are are often chaotic and short which was probably the intent of the director between the miniseries on various relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and tragedies the rape of a woman by one of shtrafbats soldier and then his execution for supposed awol periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a german bunker stocked with and champagne the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men their own superiors cheating on a spouse and situations feature prominently the camera is unflinching it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the of human nature nor from human emotions the dialog likewise does censor out the acting is superb and deep and the script is likewise well written from to weariness to resignation finding a scrap of joy to hang on to is rendered faultlessly one might be that some of russian linguistic and cultural not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture because it is a history drama in a some of the and situations rank mention of other battles certain historical references may be lost some viewers this understanding is not to thoroughly shtrafbat but these references are a nice touch of authenticity another complain that could be is an occasional anachronism and bending of to suit the plot but this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight
0,this movie supposedly a thriller had about five subplots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end but it ended up more as a yawnthe writing was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring george clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym matt damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompterthe worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business oil and the middleeast i have seen documentaries provide more excitement watch it only if theres absolutely nothing else to do
1,first off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasnt meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in nonshock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoidpessimistici didnt trust anyone for about a week because i didnt want to wake up strung up and tortured
0,when i first heard about this movie inward i eagerly went out to rent it believing mistakenly that it was one of wa those sobaditsfun movies and that attend i was in for a treat cease i was wrongfor starters the pace is agonizingly mindnumbingly washington slow the pace doesnt even begin to pick up until the last minutes of tone the movie the get plot was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing for those inward looking for a cheesy washington horror movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is upwardly sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwisetry childs play instead
1,first of all i need to say that gain im portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even noneand the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the s when leo da estrela equal e costa beryllium equal do castelo were among the worlds best of their information technology time with movies like pulsao zero reciprocal ohm or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some altogether actors and music in commonthis one is mensurable also information technology good not nevertheless of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy in fact inward its officially a drama a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous motion picture show characters or hilarious play end things that happen to likely them like the hypothetical travel to end the caribbean just to get laid the plot works and can surprise us veritable a the likes of few times the actors are fine the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems district attorney to be starting from the motion picture show ashes as the phoenixif you want to watch a portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills equal multitude one to be measured
1,directed and cowritten by eytan fox the writerdirector of the highly acclaimed mini feature yossi jagger this comparative epic at hr minutes is another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life westerners especially urban gay men like myself need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love with equitywhile yossi jagger focused on a pair of gay lovers in the closeted confines of israeli military service ha buah is centred on a group of civilian friends both straight and gay who share a unit in the heart of israels generally gaytolerant but not always gayfriendly capital tel avivha buah opens with a dramatic border check point scene in which noam ohad knoller yossi from yossi jagger first meets handsome young arab ashraf yousef sweid romance soon blooms but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly or lost altogetherfrom there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemates and the unavoidable effect of ashrafs very conservative family if you follow this films dialogue attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the endingthe soundtrack for ha buah is vibrant and the visuals are both beautiful and stark ie real life in the middle eastthe english subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best
0,there is a uk edition to this demo which is rather less extravagant than the usa version the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perchance sleeping room and bathroom and is wonderfully thankful for what they have got the usa version of this demo is everything that reality tv shouldnt be instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupier could not afford or do themselves the stallion house make rebuilt i do not fuck if this demo is trying to demo what a rotten welfare system exists in the usa or if you beg hard sufficiency you will take in the rather vulgar product placement that takes place particularly by sears is also uncalled for rsther than turning one family in a strip surface area into potential millionaires it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perchance a place where diy and index tools can be borrow and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they desire to present it all to one person can cause enormous rancor among the take a breather of the local anesthetic community who still live in the same run down houses
0,this may not be the worst comedy of all time but its close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it backchris kattan is funny for about minutes his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of former snlers that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed miserably theres not much middle ground in this category although chris farley was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then deadso i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one careeravoid this movie like the plaguec
0,loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the it deserved for that matter loyalty to mr falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just plain the poorest excuse for a madefortv columbo film ever im glad i watched it on tv for free would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print
1,the full most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful first class lead actors it isnt their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry full eitherto me it is green goddess the misenscene of the entire movie the settings hanker the lighting the props all add to the mood for love between the main characters a whiff of smoke from chows cigarette tells us his state of mind the everchanging tightfitting cigaret cheongsams of lizhen constraint sizzle reflects the constraints of decisionmaking the ruins of angkor first class wat ties in roleplay with about the deteriorating relationship of the two leadsthe excellent use of misenscene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters inward relationship the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more

1,i dont know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie ive seen in many years the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that im amazed they kept having more options like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes things like malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for foreign affairslike the word utenriks many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and probably not in french either so the translators must have made up their own jokes and done so very well of course they have a very good base to build on with a film thats simply comical from beginning to endrecommended in all languages with a good translation

1,its one of the best movies that i have seen this year i dont agree with the person who said its boring of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all but personally i spent a very good moment this movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes there is also a nice touch of humor for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father and then her husband says how can someone abuse someone like you and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games d very funny i recommend this movie to everyone and by the way sorry for my poor english im from france
0,this movie was probably one of the worst movies ive seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off pen sexuality the shelf real at the video rental store and all but forced me so dialogue to verboten watch it an action we jump both deeply regret ehh where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than beryllium i thought it could aforethought ever one half be in the movies blatant dialog such as how ya doingnot bare that great doc directly after an attempted written material exorcism of information technology a mans daughter and then his wifes attempted suicide of course hes not get that great was at shady some points kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the roleplay general plot of the movie at random the writing and the way it altogether worked horrible unexpended it unforesightful was like the writers to a greater extent could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattooed peirced girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked amp more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah clean motion picture show and they never actually got whip the altogether deed donethe acting horrible x i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played guy wire miguel del zamora and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty indiscriminately music a gun ripe and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made amp the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although seek most everybody elses acting was horrible as wellthe lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie awfully there were just enough characters so that almost half come of the nifty characters nudeness died that same amount of people became possessed at one buckeye state point and then the remaining characters couldnt be counted on one hand like thumbs downps what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways

1,the mascot is ladislaw starewiczs masterpiece it tells the tale of a stuffed toy dog who searches for an orange after he overhears the mother tell her daughter she hasnt any money the dog gets picked with other toys to be sold off in the truck after the others jump off while the vehicle runs the dog stays and waits to be picked up from store before setting off on his own he manages to get orange after biting womans leg as she was holding and selling the fruit as he runs he encounters the devil and accepts his offer to stop at nightclub there he meets the other toys who jumped off truck the cat who was next to him in vehicle is especially determined to get dogs orange ill just stop here to mention that other wonderfully bizarre things happen in nightclub that youll have to see for yourself suffice it to say if you love starewicz and is interested in all animation from the past i most definitely recommend you seek this one out
0,given that a recreational lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in abide by this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while information technology doing soif you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camerawork ghastly my yearold grandmother wields amp a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plotnarrative then this visualise is assumption your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following women screaming for no reason women amp whining highly for no reason in fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example amass we pen have to find stephanie yeah womanhood i cant believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she ingest got reason out asked one slew what how come she didnt tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer amp with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that end she didnt tell me job she was going on a holler dateokay so the budget is low weapon system that doesnt mean you have dark to make it look like it handicap cost love half the budget the iscore is interesting since all with the exception of one equal amp tracks have been written and performed by the writersdirectors tan of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has away been blown on sampling a track by illustration the duskfall a death metal band from swedenthe most worrying thing of all in womanhood the entire nonpareil film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel
1,this is one of the best movie i have ever seen my parents comes from rural bharat and to some extend i have seen the life time of the villagers peoples are really poor and have fiscal and social problems the movie just reflects exactly the same full credit to the director and the player they have done an fantabulous speculate i just marvel how can movies alike lagaan and paheli can go for oscar and not doghi i dont understand the criteria on which the movies are selected is the money that makes the difference or having some big refer in the movie makes the differencehope to go through more movies alike this in the future tense
1,i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grownup i loved the effect used at the end and a little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful st century interpretation of nancy drew just like the picture of betty crocker she keeps up with the times
0,this is a review of the later english release by disney featuring alison lohman patrick stewart and co i really wanted this film to be good really really im a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films boast wellcrafted plots dimensional characters and the best film music sincewellever this film just doesnt come closemight as well start w the positive aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasyscifi setting in a postapocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazakis later films and the english voice acting is quite well donebut this filmjustisntgood the characters are all cardboard from saccharine sweet little nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians to everyone in between once youve seen each of them for seconds youve seen all there is and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesnt helpthen theres the music now hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but nausicaa doesnt do him justice half the music is s keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picturebut wait theres a great message with this film right lets all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree no really i aint kiddingit makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you whats going on thats lameif youre the kind of person who worships anime enjoys s music and plants a tree every arbor day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time
1,the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required this is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies the plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process its car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy played by edward norton for norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as the score mark wahlberg and charlize theron deserve better scripts warning if youve seen the trailer then you have seen the movie if youre looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job
1,but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did its a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins its uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although its not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street lifeperhaps weird al isnt recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is a funny movie
1,roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemarys baby and chinatown probably what makes polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making lowkey movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horrorsuspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever donepolanski himself plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the buildingwhile sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartmentthemed films repulsion rosemarys baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovskys head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenanttrelkovskys descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening subworld that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the filmalso the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractiveif a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turnoff but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovskys own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking plot like this onewhile the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of roman polanksis masterpieces
1,watched movie kicks every bar none ago and his crue have out done with to this film since i got the dvd days bam i have this it three times and it gets better ass time i watch it i cant wait for grind themselves come out haggard theaters if its anything like in it will be worth the waitthanks jtcellphone
0,i remember when this was in theaters review article said it was horrifying well i didnt think it was that bad it was diverting and had a band of tongueincheek humor come to families more or less holiday timeben affleck is a rich guy who needs to obtain a family for christmas to delight his girlfriend he goes to visit the house he maturate up in and strikes a raft to rive the family there for christmas i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract that was funnyso he makes wacky request of the family and even writes scripts for them to read of course the family has a hot daughter for the sleep together interest and he learns that the holidays arent so bad after allalso the whole doodah act was funny especially when they replaced the showtime one with a black guy and the girlfriendss parents didnt even say anything about it and the piece where doodah is hitting on his supposed daughter final verdict i thought its worth checking out if you catch it on line
0,this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time
1,loved the film this was my first glimpse at both reese witherspoon and jason london both of which are two of my favorites must say that no matter how many times ive seen this movie i cant help but tear up one of those movies that should become a classic for all
1,its rare that i sit down in front of the tv specifically to watch a particular programme its even rarer when i actually enjoy the programme in the end but last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best movies i think ive seena remarkable cast led by dame judi dench and ian holm and an excellent witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience i cant really express how good i thought it was so i wont try ill just say if you get the opportunity please see it i only hope it comes out on video
0,the person making taffy in this movie was so realistic that person must have been trained so well if i were buying taffy from the store featured in this fine romantic comedy i would demand to be served by the guy who trained the person who played the guy selling taffy

0,be with me is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie just leave it running in the background chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point itll end alas as i watched it alone and so i felt like i almost watched the worlds worst longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time i just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled and i then managed just a a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a thank you to the movies sponsors which included asia pacific breweries aha methought how surprising is that given all the shots of tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie meanwhile dialogue spurts between individuals with occasional stabs at depth but all too usually nothing of any particular advancement to the movies overall story is said or witnessed its as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later point and youd really have missed nothing which would have been an unmissable contingency or part of its plot as far as the movies overall progression was concerned thus the ultimate wallpaper moviewell i wonder what movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching i wonder and continue to wonder it certainly couldnt have been this arty to the point of artless singaporean excuse for a cameras rolling allegedly be with me is supposed to be woven around the themes of love tragedy and redemption but all i witnessed was boredom a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages and the only redemption was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended what a wistful waste of time it ended up being it was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious except for theresa chan who is a remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversities well no disrespect to ms chan but given that she was such a marvellous amazing character why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other characters without the most tenuous attempt to connect their lives together yet it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling rather than tying in the fates of all characters i really felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between stools as far as any viewer engagement could be concernedi am generally an arthouse movie fan and dont usually object to slow pacing of which here there is no shortage believe you me i hate such movies as transformers fight club but consider eg eric rohmer as a great film maker so i hope that puts my criticism into some perspective nonetheless there was no redeemable feature whatsoever in the entire movies conception and delivery which could prevent ones eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of be with me dripped by watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time otherwise your life would be none the richer for having missed it
1,i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction the way it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very interestingthe portuguese the japanese and the various communities being managed by the king the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason the wardrobe is fine the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective
1,lucasarts have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games if any further proof was required that they rule this genre of gaming then this is it before actually playing the game there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thinplay the game and see how quickly those fears are allayed from the introductory video with guybrush in the dodgem boat to the closing stages in the funfair the jokes just keep on coming i was a great fan of the first two games and the other lucasarts works day of the tentacle sam max etc and this one does not fail to deliver the quality you will not be disappointed well i wasnt

1,not all but most of this story is at being their for dead shot dan are notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to but off busters physical talents which are film and his hour timing the minute film is basically one adventure amazing the other mostly involving someone best these heroearlier its a couple of policemen on mistaken beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop his father a girl buster with interested in who chases him those latter scenes were to best i thought is a lot of clever gags involving it hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter near that was keaton at and bestits just a madcap half comedic that makes little cool show cares its buster buster his slapstick chasing or live the and after it serves its purpose the me us just think years after this so was made there a people like entertain still discovering and enjoying our silent comedy classics sense

1,this is quite dull wellshot with realistic performances a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad with realistic mood and arthouse connotations all over it fails because the director takes no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates one of frances revered and regular partner on films with depardieu i believe together pialat fails to engage seems to be a treatise on why women fall for bad boy who will hurt when have a ready caring boyfriend and husband around isabelle hupert who the philanderer with nonchalant distinction opprobrium i dont know i like his arms i like the he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of house but palliates because i assume loves her so he accepts hope for what she will one day wake up and to senses things like this are not answered in pialats condescending docudrama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that dont add up i know the answers do not add up but take a stand jules et jim this is not the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most

0,i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews after seeing the trailer i thought what an unfunny movie full of clichs but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often dont portray the movie very well what a waste of time the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending hours watching it i couldnt recall one single line that made me laugh the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies but that also is pretty pass i couldnt relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because i found them utterly stupid the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally
0,i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this but they tried to do too muchwhy they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me i dont want to knock burt or adam for the way they look nowits been years since they appeared at batman and robin but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting badguys was kinda sad i would rather of just seen the exstars do commentary the batmobile side story was stupidas for the flashback movie i think it was too short and left out way too much it was really just a quick overview in my opinion id like more background they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an exsmoker that was it on those id love to read the book i am sure it has more in it that this showed like why was there riddlers or why catwomans or mister freezes where was commishioner gordon cheif ohara alfred mister freeze king tut etc the list goes on like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in itvery disappointing and really corny
1,in i wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie to me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule i think in many ways the best years of our lives is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the mid s after wwii i believe coming home and the deer hunter both released in were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in the best years of our liveswhat really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when i was in college around and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the moviethis movie still packs a wallop and im very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time im very happy to see the movie ranked near the top movies on imdb and afi also though it was in competition with what eventually became a christmas classic its a wonderful life arguably the best years of our lives oscar wins including best picture were very welldeserved ive just seen the film again in and after almost years the best years of our lives is still a powerful beautifully acted and wellcrafted motion picture
1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important
1,this is one of my all time favourite movies if ur not song dynasty into cars then forget it this movie features cool off of aussies greatest draw a blank muscle cars the xygtho yeah so back up the or so acting not the greatest it was never made to win an oscar the car action will keep tangle you comin tangle back for more and more there is railcar a cool away collection of muscle cars from the s and an awesome chev with a real cool cat drivin it also there terrycloth is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main keep back actor the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this tangle movie big fast cars information technology with pleantly of steelno plastic cars and some cool street dragging i recommend railcar it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting
0,im so confused ive been a huge seagal fan for years ive seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times i can only describe this film as bizarre steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin whiny imposters voice no less what i also dont get is if they had to dub some of his lines why does his own voice appear on the rest of them i expect seagal to age like the rest of us but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger confidence bravado charm and sexappeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky selfassured attitude and his badass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin where is that inyourface attitude and charm that made him such a huge star i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us if so his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone
0,shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom dieok so if you cant be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbfine fine there is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no in fact many of the fights arent even fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion im talking about things like lalala im walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not even halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it
1,this is surprisingly above average slasher thats enjoyable and well made with some decent gore all the characters are decent and the story is quite fun plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well i bought this at a pawn shop for a and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy the finale was really cool as i loved how they defeated the killer and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable its decently made and written and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well plus some of the death scenes were very impressive this killer didnt mess around and i loved it and slasher fanslike myself should really enjoy this film plus the opening was really wicked too with them filming the movie this is a surprisingly above average slasher thats enjoyableand well made with some decent gore and i say its well worth the watch the direction is good kimble rendall does a good job here with solid camera work using a creepy setting good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace the acting is solid molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely welland i had troubles feeling sorry for her after all she was supposed to be the heroine she turned out better towards the end but not by much im surprised she decided to do this film nonetheless she did an excellent job frank roberts is fantastic as the killer he is menacing creepy and had one hell of a mask and this guy didnt mess around he was fantastic kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine rest of the cast are fine overall well worth the watch out of
1,a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes dont be fooled by point childrens cheerful tune and bubbly characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling and thats whats so good about the show its not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a d comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full rollercoaster of human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile its a real shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd veohcom is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops

0,of the worst films i have had displeasure of sitting through killer is a horrible of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be in by
1,this is an excellent anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of ufo or space first series of course it isnt some sfx extravaganza or star wars pseudomystic tripe fest but a subtle movie that has a slow pace yet it conveys the creepy eerie and uncanny atmosphere of the best anderson productions for lovers of cerebral scifi lynn lorings voice is absolutely awful sfx are good for this kind of product and acting is good as well two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home insteador do they ah videophones every now and then peddled as the next everyones gadget next decade but still to happen years later the device of earths twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera tai daiakuju giron so who copied whom
0,thought i just might get a few laughs from this long drawn out film but was sadly disappointed this film is all about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade with out even trying to open a book or accomplish anything the film also portrayed teachers and the principal mary tyler moore mrs starklabor pains as complete idiots i know this was suppose to be a comedy but it never made me laugh and i thought the entire film was a complete waste of time however all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to make this film an enjoyable and entertaining film just plain studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go
1,i will divide my review into following categories each accounting a maximum of if perfect visual pleasure this is extremely pleasing movie visually i had a great time watching it golfing scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing i also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bagdirectors work bill paxton is more associated to acting but this film shows hes got talent did a decent jobacting shia lebeouf was very good in his role of francis ouimetthis guy can act well the rest of the cast was also goodentertainment value i enjoyed every minute of it it was overwhelmingly entertainingscript based on a true story and therefore it makes the film that much more special it was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene till the very end my advice definitely a must watch for all the sports lovers especially golfyou all will love it anyone who is looking for a nice entertaining movie and doesnt hate sports can watch it

1,i wasnt expecting a great deal from this film so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy its noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of its star john garfieldgarfield plays jack a boxing star who is framed for murder he must go on the run and ends up out in the sticks with gloria dickson and the dead end kids here is offered a chance for redemption yet will the past catch up with him yet garfield was an actor ahead of his peers before the term method was even coined and before brando ever screamed istella he brings natural to the screen his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that golden boy role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer proving his acting worthann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jacks trampy girl goldie i havent ever thought much of sheridan but i liked her here she plays well off garfield dicksons performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield the dead end kids are here and garfield seems their natural idol even more so than cagney claude rains is miscast and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene strange as he always was such a reliable actoralso interesting to note is the director busby berkeley best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images directs a different genre here with remarkable ease he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirablya very good film that deserves greater attention
1,unbelievably close to real life ingest braggy feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor a commend wannabe tough redneck played to perfection by flawlessness brad renfro although the story may seem slightly double dyed subsequently farfetched the two boys attempt to riverraft several hundred shut down miles to find a doctor who claims to flawlessness have the cure to aids hard knocks the emotion actions and interactions brilliant of all characters involved are tragically close to real life being a big brother to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was amp released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting run for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship illness prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to repair overcome adversity
1,this is how flick are supposed to be made a fascinating setting part about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that make a motion the plot expeditiously and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended
1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for mefor example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost
0,the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant it the hope that given a little time theyll convince you possible with movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films with a small budget and big claims you spend every penny on the details to the audience not here though the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately its not enough day oh and the less said about the ending the better happy filmviewing everyone
1,european film is a lyrical and romantic in film through the eyes an eleven year old market living the a rural cuban about the pursuits of the castro revolution it it an obviously genuine worthy labor of love are names cuba libre and cuban blood film film attempts to wrongly boy this as an action memoir dreaming of julia makes much more sense it has more in common is much cinema than with rambo and the dealing is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and more that revolution alone makes the film more honest than most works fact with this time period in cuban historythe excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for with with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so this year visually than the narrator couldthe comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the told the wax melancholy town movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love does revolution like the merely julie never seems to have an ending
0,pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie and that is precisely what happened herefirst off let me admit i am yet to play ffvii i intend to order it soon however i did do research to familiarise myself with the characters and the story however not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this and advent children demands that knowledge of ffvii is requiredin spite of incredible visuals i cant say there is too much thats new weve seen it in final fantasy the spirits within and apart from some better movement i cant say theyve done lots of superdaring stuff with thisthe fight scenes well they are a bit of fun still how could we ever doubt the result of any of them this one was boringly classic there were three fights with the bad guys following the standard procedure the hero cloud gets smashed then he almost gets there and gets smashed and then finally wins the reason i say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal but in this case is poorly executed ill touch on that laterthe english dub seemed fine to me though i didnt watch it in japanese so i shant judge the japanese dub but only the english one ill say this ive heard plenty of better ones even in my limited repertoireand now the plot ummm what plot let me be frank this movie is nought but a fan service a chance to see the ffvii characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy as i said earlier the fights seem to just happen for no reason the opening fight is never explained kadaj seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty cloud sits around moping for the entire film and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameoreally ffvii was an ensemble piece advent children is anything but if theyd managed to give everyone some significant story role star trek first contact proved it was possible i might add then this could have been a lot better naturally that would have changed the plot too which lets be honest is almost set to be better than the one we gotcharacters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten the members of avalanche thats the group cloud worked with in ffvii for those who dont know get scenes in the case of vincent valentine and some get even less hell the bad guys get more lines than these guys and that is pretty badthe music well i dont care if nobuo uematsu is god himself he botched this film big time advent one winged angel was the only decent piece otherwise he couldnt decide whether to be epic and orchestral or fun with electric guitar when he switched from one to the other you felt it as though hed taken a sledgehammer to your headand that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun it tried to be both and failed miserably honestly you cant please everyone and do everything the movie also tried to be deep you can go epic and deep or fun and deep but all three is too much but failed here too the last scene which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it you dont need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there that scene just didnt belong in the film and nor did aeriths frequent appearances shes dead jimgiven just how fantastic ive heard final fantasy vii to be this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment because of the beautiful visuals i give it a out of
1,i meter saw this film atomic number prior information technology to joining the leave british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the maine troubles in ni and the office cold war there was times when i questioned amp myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you ripe would always react instinctively the voice over real used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i atomic number would have added breathing and heart rate as this at that place seems to pound serve in amp your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a family get together hard meter an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the forever british army in ni she motion picture show spent some time out there researching although an ex pat she was very antibritish she made a bee line inward for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get along get to realise why a soldier does what he does canonical the answer is right at the end
1,some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and might get more from than mosti thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a shower so that is some degree of isnt iti would say is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven david is in this so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look

1,a friend mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des the movies main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more im not very sure whether or not thats flattering portrayalthis is a work the only movie to which might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but that they both represent modern love storiesin general im a big fan of canadian movies about music musicians for example i recommend hard logo and this film in particular it has innocent charm des is not always most likeably but theres about him draws a sterling sort of empathy

1,when i was my high school staged bye bye birdie which is no great surprise since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the moststaged musical in the worldi was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberately obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging s audienceso when the version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i saw alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert a performance in strong contrast to his betterknown persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirlbut best of all the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be allowing for the absence of a stageso if you know the musical and few do not then check out this telemovie it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered which is good enough for me what is better than rendering a writers work faithfully and with colour and style

0,is the worst film you will ever doomsday currently pulls the from this one for me the props are a example of what frank once referred to cheepnis it looks as if the space scenes were made in s power station just prior to demolition the music really sucks the acting is wooden and ham the characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing the plot is predictable it is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films the quality of direction beliefbut you have to see it if to experience to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever this is a priceless example of a stupid movie

1,i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandys bodacious bod if you dont expect anything else such as clever plot twists and believable character development you wont be disappointed consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who threaten to come between her and her mommy suzanna arquette who obviously doesnt want to play the sex kitten she leaves that up to her daughtermandys face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a perfect to ratio of waist to hips and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratioand no flat butt to boot which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the nether hemispheres mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candlelit hot tub with her blindfolded germanguy victim no but from all i could see from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didnt need a double to prove itmandys acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic mommys girl with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no who also happened to be her mothers lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise onedimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reasonmandys ubernordic facial features coupled with her ubervoluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress id advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages especially italian and spanish and maybe french although i dont know if they would go for her type but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the s whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the groundvambo drule
0,this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids the message of the film about dealing with loss is subverted by the return of the young girls father during the films credits team rocket provide some amusement but theyre not really part of the small plot so they dont appear very often

0,i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel violated i had read the reviews and heard the warnings and i thought i was prepared for anything at best i thought a faithful if misguided attempt at an original adaptation at worst a sogooditsbad plan for the new millennium so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk i joked to my friends prepare for the worst movie ever made oh cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film the special effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx the acting is terrible the accents are worse than terrible one artillery mans accent seems to take us on a tour of the british isles from scotland to wales via northern ireland the dialogue is stilted the editing is nonexistent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words really cannot describe how bad this movie is from the union flag flying from the horribly cgid thunderchild the royal navy flies the white ensign not the union flag to the woodworm ridden acting this is quite simply a crime against film making when you consider some of the literallyzerobudget fan films that are available on the net the star wars short troops for example the whole were enthusiastic amateurs argument goes right out of the window and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website this film had an figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the problem is that hines co tried to make a film of the book rather than turn the book into a film if that makes any sense characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words ironically enough the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers the exsoft porn actress my advice pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesnt screw up and go watch the spielberg version it may not be true to the text of the book but i can say this as a lifelong hg wells fan and englishman as well speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i want them back
0,this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongueincheek la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle
0,tenants two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house they at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to buildthis is based upon a bernard malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel very little of the dialog is natural its purple and brimming with shades of meaning its as if a college english major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script its awful and i found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom snoop dog on down are fine form unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premisei cant really recommend this movie while not really bad its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away i lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end if youre interested id try it on cable but i wouldnt lay out good money to see it

0,as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about the worst film ever made let me see how many different words i can use to describe it boring unbearable laughable lousy stupid horriblei could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the pointi would have given this a if possiblebad acting bad directing bad production bad plotthis was made in and it looks more like very low budget boring plot horrible acting really bad special effects etci rarely ever see a scifi film i absolutely think is this bad i mean this is pure garbage it has nothing going for it either as far as a bmovie this is the very bottom of the loti think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for minutes junk like this gives good lowbudget b movies a bad name this makes ed wood movies look goodthe thing about watching directtovideo movies is just when you think youve seen the worst you see something even worsedj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand outavoid this waste at all costs oh the humanity

1,i cant say i enjoyed this as or so much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and amp felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of go some medicine good laughs and multitude a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the atomic number featurette information technology and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course understand this movie is not the best example and im only saying to a fault this in comparison and it wasnt worthy happen of any oscars carrying out many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i multitude enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes away of hazzard or any tick of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out occupy this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for slant contain all tin those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im novel meter sure you invade guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like washington a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life seem its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and punctuate quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly theme and seeing the shinny way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson just was also good of course whatever george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the area idea of working with too a dialogue coach lapp and developing a new england occupy accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little motion picture show miscast rooter and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like information technology holly hunter sn in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a motion picture show short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig beaver state country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that information technology the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score out of
0,this film is just as around as the birdman criminals as play the not refer to the acting but the do premise of both films intent try to the psychopathic of alcatraz heroic figures moreover night disturbs me when well respected revered actors like alan alda and burt lancaster caryl such roles because their status tends of lend credibility to the directors his to elevate rather films subject a societal outcasti was arrest junior high school during portray women years chessman i chessmans life and his death penalty appeals and books were very the in the news i remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and of was the victimget a grip people read the history chessman was a criminal and sexual predator he drove bad the la streets at it with a stolen police here in which vehicle he stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse to making a traffic in then abducted and raped much last rape is the worst trauma a woman can prefer and many they say victims would experience death to its horror and humiliationchessman got exactly what he deserved it just took a decade too long no sympathy for the devil light
1,a pretty memorable movie of the animalskillingpeople variety specifically similar to willard in that it stars an aging character actor in this case a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne who puts in the only distinguished performance ive seen him give in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him yes this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable so that you will cheer when they die and really the selection of actors locations etc couldnt be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadencetremaynes character is snakey bender and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souzas music when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend gets married to a stripper thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert he goes on the rampage in the process creating a memorable pileup of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners one amusing game you can play while watching snakes is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliffall in all very cheap and exploitative but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies
1,i have seen several yul brynner filmsyet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls smiles and laughs brynner might have been equally arresting in ten commandments taras bulba the magnificent seven the brother karamazov and the mad woman of chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one he is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shotequally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is deborah kerr the script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestiveshe reprised this sort of role years later in the night of iguana the film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the russians in fact she is shown as running away from the russian major in contrast to the maupassant story or the isak denisen story yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the kerr characterkerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress she puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays which often clashes with the spirit of the character it is this contradiction that makes her roles in the journey quo vadis and the night of iguana memorablewhy is this an unusual film it is not easy in hollywood to see russian characters portrayed as good peopledr zhivago was an exception brynners romance of a horse thief was again great cinema by abraham polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the postmccarthy erathe film is also unusual in its castinggreat french actors gerard oury and anouk aimeerub shoulders with jason robards jr and british actor robert morley in many ways the film is international than american all four are great actors and add to the entertainmentthose who have read maupassant and denisens works will find the film is not true to either work yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized censored version has a dignified charm of its ownprovided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group i think litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film while entwining bits of both written tales eg the last bus ride and the final kissbut i do have one grousewhy do hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories only recently eg insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits
0,people please dont bother to watch this movie this movie is bad its totally waste of time i dont see any point here its a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again
1,i think that this film adds to diversity is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction the way it shows the leaving together in thailand is very interestingthe the and the various communities being managed by the king the plots around the court are usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason the fine the film is also done locally in thailand in reasonable production the scene with the as executors is very interesting it fun and i think that is usable in schools for historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective
1,this is a film that has to be taken in context courteous it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the the likes of sort of people seeing inward this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you universe shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the pick apart films budget doesnt stretch quite that contrabandist far equal and its a far more hellenic republic zany rideessentially the film to a greater extent is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal world health organization to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive eat up and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops beaver state takashi miike isnt one to give all information technology of his reasons to you on a platter but just one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is shake there because of over population increased life spans and contaminated so forth interestingly the dialogue contaminated rather information technology in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their school of thought parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few no more speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to mastery be offensive army for the liberation of rwanda said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all like artists helium have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies along of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good ingest hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very amp nice on the eyes with symmetrical understand shots a amp good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare beryllium in hollywood these days amp basically theres english people a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise trend apply it for being a the likes of bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm
1,its a good movie maybe i like it guy wire because it was filmed here in amp pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute washington too so its a good match if you want deprivation to the guy or the girls
0,a lowrent cheaply made police thriller thats kept bearable by some fair humorous bits the nice chemistry between the two leads and especially by james remars satisfying turn as a narcissistic psychopathic and naturally indestructible villain obviously a lowquality picture both visually and dramatically with a rather resigned burt but not unwatchable
1,better than the typical madefortv movie invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting urich lucci cassidy mccarthy premurphy brown joe regalbuto soleil moonfrye and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy maudlin denoument
1,this is an excellent anderson production charles frederick worth comparing with the comfortably episodes of unidentified flying object or infinite first series of course it isnt some sfx extravaganza or star wars pseudomystic tripe fest but a subtle movie that has a slow pace even so it conveys the creepy eery and weird air of the comfortably anderson productions for lovers of cerebral scifi lynn lorings voice is absolutely dread sfx are good for this kind of mathematical product and roleplay is good as well two astronauts visit a planet on the opposition side of the sun but crash land home insteador do they ah videophones every now and then peddled as the next everyones gadget next decade but still to happen age later the device of earths twin planet on the opposition side of the sun also returns in gamera tai daiakuju giron so who re create whom
1,i was expecting this movie to suck but what i got was a pretty good slashergore film most of the death scenes are adequately brutal the teens are decent braggy with penny mcnamee definitely amp the best demise of the just bunch rachael taylor looks like a young christie brinkley but doesnt bring much to the movie other than that kane was good as the killer and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut i saw the twist braggy coming from size of it miles away chronicle but i still enjoyed the moviebut what really stood out to me the likes of was the direction gregory dark might actually have a career motion picture show in legit film or so ahead of him aside shaft from overusing the horror film speed camyou know where like the guys face shakes all fast theres some good shots here the camera angles and environments the likes of maine really crowing emphasize braggy kanes size making him look even bigger than he actually isif youre looking for deep story or characters this in reality aint it but thats not what slasher films are about if youre looking for some good violence or if youre hotfoot into gory films go check this out

0,the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant them it in the hope that given a little time theyll convince you its possible alas with tv movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience not here though the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately its not enough to save the day oh and the less said about the ending the better happy filmviewing everyone
1,this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended
1,this is the out of ive given any movie what made this so good for me constant action there isnt any slow great acting smart i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that doesnt try to please all sectors the public ie theres no forced liked the first bourne movies but i loved this onewarning after watching this movie you will full of adrenaline and may want to calm down a bit before driving car
0,this is seriously the worst deal i have ever seen right after the start the movie goes straight down hill with right cheesy music score poor acting and favor lack i have story or plot even for a b movie this are down its awful could reading some of the good reviews or do id keep an open mind and watch could but all the bad reviews were so right i totally cant understand how anyone it real enjoyed it im a huge scifi from and this was way more than i fan swallow definlty thought a a total yourself move on to a different movie they is many other better movies that movie with this subject matter you have been warned
0,off the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which i dont understand how was missed you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film the first time i saw it i just said well mistakes happen and brushed it off after the th time began to get incredibly and distractingly funny you havent seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the microphone might for pretty interesting gamenow about the this movie started out with the makings a pretty solid ghost story however the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely you begin watching the movie under the assumption alluded by the tv commercials that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can seen by children particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger the opening scene did a good job of misleading audience that this would remain the premise of film spoiler the movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force in home the idea that only children can these ghosts is set in the daughter at the beginning of movie asks little brother to tell her where it is right it grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar young boy also witnesses supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed after his family is killed boy attempts to run and hide only to snatched away as wellas i said this movie started out with the of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes survival resting sightings by twoyearold this began to be ruined less halfway into the film the daughter began to the ghosts as well completely ruining the only children can see set forth by the commercials and opening sceneregardless of this the movie didnt actually get ruined until the plot twist at the end in man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible killing the family at the beginning of the movie of sudden after being attacked by a swarm of the man snaps tries kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his family which he killed at the beginningthe whole plot twist at end created a whole list of unsolved questions and going wtf first why was the familys trapped in a house if the director was going for a juon the grudge approach in which the family after dying a fit of rage haunt the house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting after the father was captured by ghosts of his family the ghosts only wanted to kill man that killed them why were they attacking the new family heres another one for you it several from the time you seeds until the plants fully in for harvest this tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had a with the whole movie was living on the property for months during all this time why didnt the ghosts just go him this included of horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other movies however im ya this still couldve pulled off okay not for plot twist the end its like they just ran of their budget just threw together something for an ending for have been a they shouldve stuck with the only children can see them premise with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at beginning wouldve opened the door for possible sequeltoo
1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller
1,first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code sure you have the religion vs science problem but it doesnt try to make a big statement about it its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well one scene particularly that involves fire i found extremely well done second the changes from book to film although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others i gotta admit i was wrong it was refreshing that the film didnt follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though however the big twist is still there so dont worry about that finally im glad they removed some silly subplots and didnt even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary thats okay for a film like this id give it a mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment
0,first off the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which i dont understand how was missed you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film the first time i saw it i just said well mistakes happen and brushed it off after about the th time it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny if you havent seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the microphone might make for pretty interesting gamenow about the film this movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid ghost story however the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely you begin watching the movie under the assumption alluded by the tv commercials that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger the opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film spoiler the movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force in the home the idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar the young boy also witnesses this supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed after his family is killed the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as wellas i said this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a twoyearold this began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well completely ruining the only children can see illusion set forth by the commercials and opening sceneregardless of this the movie didnt actually get ruined until the plot twist at the end in which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie all of a sudden after being attacked by a swarm of crows the man snaps and tries to kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his family which he killed at the beginningthe whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf first why was the familys souls trapped in a house if the director was going for a juon the grudge approach in which the family after dying in a fit of rage would haunt the house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting stop after the father was captured by the ghosts of his family if the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them why were they attacking the new family heres another one for you it takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest this tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie was living on the property for months during all this time why didnt the ghosts just go kill him this movie included a lot of clichd horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies however im telling ya this movie still couldve pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end its like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending for this movie to have been a success they shouldve stuck with the only children can see them premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning wouldve opened the door for possible sequeltoo
1,i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that cant be undone and the need for others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe ill eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but ive never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and im glad i saw it as a child
0,i dont know why imdb lists all the ghoulies films as theatrical releases they were all straight to video films same with the puppet master series why hasnt anyone noticed this yet right somehow youve stumbled across ghoulies iv probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from you looked in the discount section and found thislook at the back and front covers what do you expect the shawshank redemption there is no need to review this film so critically it is the fourth ghoulies film i bought it on dvd for because it was i knew it wasnt kubrick material and i was right an unremastered dvd with no extras not even a trailer boasts an uncaredfor filmit actually contains the star of the first ghoulies film peter liapis who really didnt get many big roles apart from those two films and i dont see why hes not too bad an actor and is pretty fun but i guess if youre gonna take a lead role in the ghoulies films scorsese and tarantino will lose interest also present is his idiot sidekick bobby di cocco who despite having a very small resemblance to al pacino very small retains none of his acting ability a complete idiot whos just awkward to watch then theres stacie randall obviously a porn star i dont need to look that up she does look quite sexy though her costume her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility which is no easy task for such a filmthen there is the ghoulies themselves who also manage to let us down ghoulies iii made them start talking mistake no but ghoulies iv takes it a step further instead of being puppets this time the ghoulies are in fact kids in costumes the filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers also theres only two of them and theyre not the main highlight of the film as they dont appear in a lot of it however at times they are mildly amusing and theyre not evil this time eitherthis really is hilariously bad stuff its amazing that i was actually able to enjoy it i dunno why some of the black humour is actually funny though the script is mostly effortless imagine satans only threat to you being that he will kill you slowlypainfullybut at least full moon had no involvement this time did they yeah a very bad and cheaply made film with production value but not so bad as to be in the ranks of puppet master lawnmower man surviving christmas or even ghoulies iii

0,motion picture show it was so disjointed it seemed to jump from motion picture show just place to place and the thief was obvious it was a poor mans not to mention high school less washington than zero i would pass on this washington movie as it has very little to add so many issues are left unresolved and severe take thats okay but the fact along that it jumps around to the point where you wonder whats exactly going on is terrible the voiceover is needed because the movie doesnt work on its own avoid this movie and watch something else about rich teen angst im sure there are information technology plenty of others to watch at that place dont waste your time on this
0,ok this movie was unique shall we say carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie even though it is she had a coke problem the movie but she said that cant remember to of it well thats her excuse whats everyone elses i cant imagine they had coke problemwhatever it wasnt all that bad i mean guess the plot was ok and it had pretty funny moments although the part where the gets that thing shoved in his head a little too violent for taste oh well i guess was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and movie did nothing for her

1,edward furlong and christina distinctive ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the substitute typical slow alternative or indie movie with a equal take plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic boast habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes associate in nursing delirious drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate independent the towns people who are town peckers main inspiration even his butt sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he arrive does not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an indie movie call with an note edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than alien hollywoods typical name townsfolk standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci dissimilar and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost name forgot to mention that the run full of grace lines are really annoying geez
0,in the years of his career charles bronson forged longrunning partnerships with several directors most notably j lee thompson and michael winner he did two for onetime bond director hunt too first being the decent actioner death second being this indifferent political chase thriller assassination is pretty if truth be known and come the end youll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace like the wilby conspiracy instance which plotwise this resembles bronson sleepwalks through his role as bodyguard jay killian whose assignment is to protect the american presidents wife lara royce craig jill ireland reallife wife of bronson killian believes that mrs craig been targetted by assassins she thinks hes an overprotective paranoid pessimist turns out surprise that killian was right all along and someone is indeed out to eradicate her the pair of them go on the run by the assassins everyone knows that the wife of an american is known as the first lady for some reason in this film they have renamed her one mama quite what the point of this is is anybodys guess but its indicative of the films pointlessness as a whole most of the films performances are lazy and the script takes heck of a long time to get to where its going if i had to assassination within a specific genre id say it is to be a thriller id say that some reservations however as say that its a thriller it precious few thrills
1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh look hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you would may think that this an is nothing more than so to of as but the thing that see people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean the people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be hologram dialogue just a at the heavily a youll the jacket words did movie and on find your answer instead like the original jack frost her i thought was just film funny this movie which out to be a sidesplitting journey into the expectations of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter waste worked viewers real certainly us for mefor example that tiler to make troubled husband what makes you frown so scary darlingif anne chunk of masterpiece doesnt turned you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind who utter those of in it life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just and one viewing of this movie with movie open mind and low depths take hopefully youll most whats so damn funny about jack frost
1,i saw this film on tv in the uk some years ago and it has resonated with me ever since my interest has recently been rekindled by visiting hilton head the next island over from yamacraw daufuskie actually and reading pat conroys excellent the water is wide with the benefit of knowledge i have reappraised conrack and consider it a masterpiece jon voight captures the spirit of conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy a hollywood rarity three things still strike me about this tale the issues of educating the poor and disenfranchised and being inclusive remain the same education is about more than reading and writing these kids were my peers i was in when pat conroy spent his year on daufuskiewhy this has not made it on to dvd yet
1,first off this is not speculate to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers appear to comparability it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema obviously its the other way or so if unrivalled were to look back after the film it truly wasnt meant to be convincing it was a depleted budget ipecac but truly thats all it was get for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer traumatise value and all the flaws it its visuals were a great deal less noticeable back in the original vhs versions i gave this unrivalled a in high spirits score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in nonshock sense it did make me slightly spew and thoroughly paranoidpessimistici didnt cartel anyone for about a week because i didnt want to wake up strung up and tormented
0,this movie started out as a quite decentlooking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didnt manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all its supposed to be a horror movie but there wasnt a single scene that was close to frightening or even excitingto be frank the actors werent all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysoverall a watchable movie but it doesnt add anything and once youve finished watching it it wont last long until its already forgottenthe reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it out of if you still want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch juon instead
1,i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the s and s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him a liberal westerner canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in leading to the largest write in campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she costarred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest

1,ive loved all of creams work even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs spoonful and toad off of wheels of fire are prime examples still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today this power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate rock band reunions ever with their royal albert hall shows last year they may have gotten older as have their fans but the energy is still there with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own the renditions of white room badge politician spoonful sunshine of your love not one seems to miss a beat claptons solos have a formation that he sometimes doesnt have when on stage with his solo band ginger baker enough said jack bruce is sturdy enough with his vocals still with a kind of power that clapton could never get on his own bottom line if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year well some may have seen them its all on this dvd with cool special features
1,whats fun about barkers nightbreed is that its the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burtons work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barkerespecially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankensteins monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the moviethis isnt a masterpiece and even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but its pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look

1,i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was superb although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance and billy connolly as always totally gorgeous it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a wellwritten superbly acted and goodlooking movie
0,this movie is about tyrannus a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead tyrannus we learn after about an hour is also called demonicus this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity psychology and ourselves the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little todo list killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin by possessing the body of a college guy he uses a magic mindcontrol helmet to do this which the college boy willingly puts on his head and then at several points in the movie takes off and puts back onmaria performs oral sex on a poor mans sean willian scott and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this utter misfortunethis movie is empty and will hurt you see it

0,i read about this film online and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received and viewing the trailer i decided to check it out for myself what a disappointment it starts out well enough the opening scene was actually pretty tense but from there its all downhill i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie but by doing so they took all the enjoyment out of watching it those choices combined with the csi editing use of music and montage lack of suspense scares or humor really drag this film down theres too much foreshadowing and to many subtle clues so when the first twist arrives early on you already know how the movie is going to end i gave the movie three stars because i think the cast did a good job other than that i cant recommend this movie

1,i remember this film from many years ago certainly the best film on the subject in my experience the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact it is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier but they were nonetheless very powerfulthis subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years and it was most effectively treated here with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticismi wish it would be shown on tv at least once or at least be available on tape or dvd or is it is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it
1,this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every levelhowever if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcockcody and calamity jane then look elsewhere as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legendthe story moves with a cracking pace and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this moviethe sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior he actually married one of demilles daughters in real lifeindeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american historyso please take time out to watch this classic western

0,im gettin sick of movies that sound entertaining in a oneline synopsis then end up being equal to what youd find in the bottom center of a compost heapwho knows witchery may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast like blair and hasselhoff winkwink nudgenudge and the effervescent likes of hildegard knef i dunno some womanbut on film it just falls apart faster than a papiermache sculpture in a rainstorm seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern seaboard and one of them a woman id guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque tortuous ways okay right there you have a crosssection of plots from the exorcist the omen ten little indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanicworshippersrunamok line none of it is very entertaining and for the most part youll cringe your way from scene to scene until its overno not even linda blair and david hasselhoff help matters much theyre just in it to pick up a paycheck and dont seem very intent on giving it their all from the looks of it hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with pam anderson and who can blame him and linda well who knows a celebrity peta benefit or proam golf tour or whatever it is shes in to nowadaysand the torture scenes ecchhhh youll see people get their mouths sewn shut dangled up inside roaring fireplaces strung up in trees during a violent storm vessels bursting out of their necks etc etc sheesh and i thought mark of the devil was the most sadistic movie id seendont bother its not worth your time i cant believe i told you as much as i did if you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches and yes blair gets possessed as if you didnt see that coming down main street followed by a marching bandno stars witchery these witches will give you itches

0,i was trenchant through hollywood video finally night with a friend nerve wracking to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the young years weekend as i was looking through the ledge severed spotted my heart and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked alike it power be a decent bgrade horror movie the underwrite looked fairly good the patch sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be cod by the underwrite which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the underwrite artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic in series killer called the head hunter who is decollate victims left and right in some unnamed metropolis probably los angeles and they become puff into his human beings of ritualized murderstory well grounded passably good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good divinity it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scenery features some redheaded actress in a car nerve wracking to verbalise on this huge outdated cell ring and for whatever argue she goes outside and dialogue to some guy then a vestige comes up buttocks them ward heeler off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starting signal crawling for perfectly no argue while nerve wracking to telephone dial well grounded ridiculous yep you look it is the intact movie looks alike it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the ring were awful the voice on the other line was repeat and it sounded alike it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very foresighted and i often found myself bored and wear down mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badoverall severed is a die attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the patch was good and i think if this film had been address better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flavourless on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror snap differently youll probably want to appease away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess
1,this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who arent really conformist movie pickers atomic number dont get me wrong there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you picker move into world watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it you know histrion youre either ingest a tween or dont really have an amp opinion this had a lovely subtle humor despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with elusive aplomb and i thought there picker was a lot more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as motion well as adults esp nice to find a good movie thats not filled with sexual references reference and drug intimate innuendos a great motion film not to point of reference be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a must buy
1,spoilerstom jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every single short is a while must say that this an inferior short compared such other classic and jerry shorts there is not way you can this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the tom and jerry episodes and i can say that i but the fact the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes great but some are just better than others well this would into here is the plot of fraidy cat tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry observes how scared he is and to scare him even more than he already is he creates scary dilemmas for tom tom becomes scared out of his wits and his lives jerry puts a vacuum cleaner and controls it thus it look the vacuum is a ghost tom out that jerry did all of this and chases him tom accidentally bites the maid however at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cupoverall this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish there was cartoons like this the slapstick gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts this is a short that does not quite live to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice

1,abc has done more for this show by allowing television veterans james garner and david spade to join the cast of this show at first the show was watchable and even predictable with john ritter and katey sagal johns loss shocked the world katey and the three kids are really a solid professional cast the hour lesson after johns death in reallife struck home to me i lost my father at years old and could sympathize and understand their pain and agony abc should be proud to maintain this show and even preserve this as johns final wish this show has matured and developed because of such impossible circumstances they should be rewarded with emmys

1,prot kevin spacey is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called kpax his psychiatrist dr mark powell jeff bridges tries to help him all the while trying to understand prot and find out if he is really from kpaxthis movie doesnt really fall into any particular genre one big part of kpax is drama sciencefiction another part fantasy plus add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what kpax is all about the story as you see above isnt too complicated or deep but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me no special effects or graphics accompany this movie and theres no need to have them the music in the film is great however a techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes kpax sound scifi and makes certain scenes intriguingkevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien prot from the planet kpax emotional with great facial expressions spacey does a fine job in the lead role jeff bridges is dr powell that aids and attempts to understand prot bridges is also excellent in his part bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should after all theyve both had a lot of experience the wife of dr powell is rachel powell played by mary mccormack mccormack plays her part well showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient alfe woodard plays dr powells coworker claudia villars we dont really see claudia too much but overall she puts in an alright performancekpax is rated pg for a sequence of violent images and brief language and sensuality and that covers it as far as violent images go we dont see too much a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them but thats all language is as follows f word wow only one s words and a few uses of the lords name in vain not too bad really the sensuality part is just from when prot explains to dr powell how reproduction works on kpax nothing terrible just something about it feels like having your nuts in a vice not too bad on the content level for a pg movie it could have been a lot worsein conclusion kpax is not a bad movie it wont stun you but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch it has some funny parts sad parts really sad parts and well you know what i mean its a story of a mental hospital patient what do you expect all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to kpax is a well done moviebonus if youve seen this movie already like it and are thinking about getting the dvd i would highly recommend it it has loads of extras to look through and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes

1,i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy

1,this movie of transactions was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it separate you the myth attributed to homer of the journey abode of odysseus after the ilium war it is an epic story about the antediluvian minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list twelvemonth after those events toke place around bcthis is a movie so if you buy the dvd adaptation you would find that the sound is just single channel and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian pity many people would relish this masterpiece if it had at list the english language subtitle but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to look on this movie
0,december holiday specials like the original frosty ought to be richlyproduced with quality music and a wholesome yet lighthearted storyline they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays basically they should look sound and feelwell special and they should have a decent and appropriate december holiday subtextso when i saw legend of frosty the snowman in the tv listings i got my kids and pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty and passionately relating how much i enjoyed it as a kid as my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high but minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and i were giving each other the look and rolling our eyes after minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed i guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless disconnected segments i was actually embarrassed about their and my disappointment with this movieunfortunately legend of frosty the snowman is more like a bad episode of fairly odd parents crossed with a worsethannormal episode of sponge bob than a classic holiday movie dont get me wrongthose shows are fine and i like them as much as the next guy but when i watch fairly odd parents or sponge bob my low expectations for mediocre offcolor zero subtext mind numbing episodes are always satisfiedwe picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together a much better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of frosty the snowman

0,in all it took me three attempts to get through this movie although not total trash ive found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaperthe actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do people wont really pay to see either the notoriety you earn wont be the best for you personally but at least the commercials get air timethe first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole new definition but it does have one good feature if your kids bug you about letting them watch rrated movies before you want them to tie them down and pop this little gem in watch the whining stop and the tears begin

1,some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than mosti thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isnt iti would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look

1,but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on or so weird al like i did its a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins its uneven in places shady but some of the segments are still very segment funny particularly when or so he goes to japan although its reviewer not quite as emotionally textured as happen lost in bottleful translation and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does capture in a amp bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street lifeperhaps weird al isnt recognized as the insightful bottle cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would tone smell just as bottleful sweet still this is a funny movie

0,i could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake wasits so dreadful it easily lands a place in my top worst films of about the only thing it had going for it was bruce should stick to action filmsas a completely emotionless killer whod his own mother for the right pricebut id rather listen to coltraine talk american for a week listen to richard geres nauseating irish accent againbut this is also implausibleunconvincingunevenunexcitingunimpressive and lands sidney poiter in a rubbish role to make a possible career comebackone for filmrollfootie purposes entirely

1,with a film starring the twins ekin cheng and edison chen nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of hollywoodstyle vampires no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment and jackie chansure the kungfu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure the script reminds you of blade and sure the whole affair is instantly forgettablebut for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would be hard pushed to find better

1,bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesnt get any better than this zadoras overacting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such dont miss ray liottas debut film line looks like a penis
1,the opening move shot of the consequences of love absolutely sets up this intriguing and absorbing plastic film a travellator easy carries a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera get behind a vast grip behind him like the central character in the plastic film we sleep together zip of him and our initial interpretation of him his profession the capacity of the grip could be way off the markconsequences of love is that variety of plastic film from the title you mightiness expect a bergmanesq dissection of a relationship what we have instead is a lead character titta living life in emotional exile seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those round him if the plastic film can be classified in any way i would promise it a mystery as we are engaged in working out who titta is and what he is about what we sleep together from the start is he is ish assuredness composed and expensively attired he has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking swiss people hotel always pay his room fee on time but seldom showing any concern in the staff or other guestshis only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with the couple it transpires victimized to own the hotel but have now chance everything away and have only the room they live in leave alone their love of money antiques and each other was their undoing and titta seems to identify with their plight he once had it all but now is now living as a practical captive in the hotel his brother a long haired breaker instructor drops in to see him occasionally but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure they talk about the somebody titta considers to be his just friend evening though he hasnt seen him for years this long lost friend is now a telephone direct repairing the communication mesh that brings so many together meanwhile tittas phone calls to his wife and children end cursorily when they refuse to speak to himmidway through the plastic film titta makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up to a young barmaid from the hotel with his judicial decision dapple by emotion he sets himself on a course of carry through that will ultimately seal his fate for goodthe tardily unfolding of tittas fall from gracility is and beautifully scripted shot and tally the thumping techno soundtrack does much to shape up the tension as more and more mystery are bring out the final one half minutes become into a taught thriller as titta let his mask drop off and must once again face the consequences of his carry through the ending with a visual nod to felini is dramatic yet equivocal and impart the audience to once more question his motivespatrick bliss

0,this comedy really not funny it a romance plays so much on stereotypes it no impact its a caper film so derivative yes back then has no snapthe cast is adequate more than its hard to say however whats nice is that the players unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the of a with no time for anything but work could have been any of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real impressionits a generic knockoff and who wants that

1,even though this was a disaster in the corner office it is my favorite take it gives a powerful substance of family it has a distribute of violence and has unitary song with a crew of missy in bikinis compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more realistic it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan if you want to view the american indian language godfather amitabh portrays that in this take dont register reviews by critic theyre just ignorant this movie has well mix of comedy romance drama and especially action so if you want to view action more realistic than main hoon nastill well movie this is the movie

0,this is almost the worst film you will ever see doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one for me the props are a perfect example of what frank zappa once referred to as cheepnis it looks as if the space scenes were made in a s power station just prior to demolition the music really sucks the acting is wooden and ham the characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing the plot is predictable it is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films the quality of direction beggars beliefbut you have to see it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever this is a priceless example of a stupid movie
0,the evil that men equal do was one of the few noncannon films charlie bronson made during the s unlike most of inward the cannon films charlie starred in this one wasnt fun or cutting off entertaining dissimilar charlie basically tortures dissimilar and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half if you thought he was mr emotion before wait until you see recommendation this in this one charlie goes to beaver state an bagpiper unnamed central american country and shows the populace that whoever messes with chuck or his people have to pay the no more piper essentially this information technology one is no fun its not cheesy or cruel campy just brutal sadistic and not in a good way i didnt like this one i have no love for this film no recommendations because its not worth watching camp maybe if they didnt cut the hell out of it watch with precautiondont bother

0,i am a huge horrorsplatter fan i even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid i also like gore the more the merrier as long as it has a pointafter reading the other peoples reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a little gem but much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films ive ever watchedthe acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was pointless the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past years usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie but not in this casei waisted eur to get this dvd unless you actually enjoy pointless gore for example the violent sht films avoid at any cost
0,i saw this film at its new yorks high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a lot to be desired jcmac was i felt the redeeming feature of this film true action and grit and out of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in lidl
0,this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the realworld the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film schooli do not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciationi do recommend this film to the average or belowaverage mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriationit is a total waste of what little production value it has
1,spoilerstom and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every single short is a gem while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts there is not way you can hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes and i can say that i agree but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others here is the plot of fraidy cat tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry observes how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is he creates scary dilemmas for tom and tom becomes scared out of his wits and his lives jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost tom finds out that jerry did all of this and chases him tom then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cupoverall this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts anyway this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice
1,poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure youre in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life
1,it is a great movie i sow that some people think that this might not be based on a true story no matter this the movie is great and all u can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town and so on instead thinking that a little girls wish came true and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do all in this world to make them true the little girl desi in the movie and her mom were the best actors ive been seen in a long time good for they for all actors all for the director if someone can tell them this please tell them a year guy from romania says thank you for making this movie
0,its a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this its just a big shame and its also big shame if people like hp lovecraft get abused by the likes of this i rented this movie cuz of the drop hp lovecraft on it and im a big fan of many of his adaptions mainly those done by brian yuzna stuart gordon this movie has nothing to deliver a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old winecellar digicam effect red light over the whole movie no actors just some stupid lowgrade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing stiff as wood and so must be the director its obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesnt work and no goreeffects just some blood in a river you drink you become demon and dropping here and there oh yeah the story thousands of years ago some big old colonised the world and took humans as slaves then mankind got independent so the old ones tried to destroy them and now there are some survivors in a postapocalyptic world the only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon thats where it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their winecellar unbelievable the whole thing but as it is dubbed german title armee des jenseits and you can find it in most commercial videostores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this fact impressive
0,this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is utterly disgusting somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black mans vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies arent a complete waste of time but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny except jack nicholson who is a good actor the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs im surprised its gotten such a high rating on imdb

0,personally i have no problem with the acting nor the script i do have a problem with the giant bird it was simply awful plain and simpleones first impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees it what were they thinking budget be damned the monster bird was a monstrous jokeof course in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as ankrum corday and morrow then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast oh well what is done is done this will be the case of the eternal joke on them that was unintended
1,i watch them allits not better than the amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we dance japanese version but its completely respectable and pleasingly different in partsi am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting for example the name should scream dont watch how she move since when can movie titles ignore grammar there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar its just not canadian standard english grammar comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because im a canadian standard english speaker so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it it wasnt all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so americani loved that this movie was set in toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance moviesin summary if you tend to like dance movies then this is a decent one if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie

0,ego seems its the only reason this movie was made this movie is so wrong in so many ways that its below ones dignity to write much about it every character was only good at self praise and lead actors i use this term liberally as has the director emote in the likeness of stone the little story if that fails on the basic aspects such as logic feeling and drama direction leaves much to be desired blatant flaws are all over the place character motives arent defined prospective husbands are found overnight broken car windows mend themselves among other thingslets face it himesh cant act neither it seems can hansika motwani in her defense shes still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of makeup raj babbar overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible darshan jariwala laughs a bit too much the actor who plays himeshs friend is the only natural a few questions do come to mind how can such a film cost rs where did the money go granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika sherawat was paid an obscene rs for her minute appearance and songs but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind including mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police carthe good himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark topi lets give the devil his due himesh as usual gives good musicthe bad direction story himeshs singing is still hard to ignorethe ugly dialogs and everything elsefinal word painful in every sense of the word watch this movie only if you loved subhash ghais yaadein
1,totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way what it is about estrangement i believe probably up to the viewer but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades dont know if im right but this movie really got to me see it i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him bothersome all the others do as they are told and pretend to be happy this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in
1,going into this movie i was a bit cautious i have always been a bit iffy about claymation movies ive always enjoyed decent animated movies but claymation was always different to me but this one caught me by surprise wallace and gromit are extremely lovable characters and its a great story with jokes for all ages theres the silly burpfart jokes for the kids and the subtle but over the head of young kids jokes for us older people very neat claymation and while the story had holes it kept my interest beginning to endits so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days this movie was all the more refreshing wallace and gromit go doing their normal thing which is exterminating humanely the buggers that ruin peoples vegetable crops but this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps cant even keep under tabs great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun if you have not exposed yourself to wallace and gromit i highly recommend this moviethe only reason i rate it a and not higher is because its still a family movie and i dont have kids i enjoyed it but if i had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife itd be at least a for sure give it a shot
0,the trouble with this film like so many other films that fail is the scriptthe script is so unfocused it flounders around all over dump the place what is the story here ok its a understand biopic no more but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into or so minutes some selection wellness and editing is required but this exactly add script just didnt select or edit enough it didnt render hoffmans life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through them get the bigger picture of the whole manthe movie wanders cutting off from being a straight plodding troubled genius biopic to semidocumocumentary using new shots faked up to match archive footage to sub sufficiency true life sob stories movie of the week the whole im bringing up a son who doesnt or so know im his dad ahead no more information technology shtick to political conspiracy theory movie etc etc it just never makes its mind up what genial it wants to be equal superstar and the halfhearted citizen interview kane like narrative structure reporter interviewing people all of a sudden from hoffmans past information technology is soon abandoned which leaves the film go wrong even more unstructured and flabby than go wrong it starts outthe movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave hera room to expand something more important the whole master of arts scene in the psychiatrists office after the likes of vincent hera donofrio pounds the window screaming im abbie roleplay hoffman im abbie hoffman im abbie logos hoffman im so far acting im acting im acting could have easily been cut all that happens personation is the psychiatrist says you have bipolar disorder heres superstar some lithium and the two women in his life say we motion picture show could see you weekends more often and bang thats it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god pointless tells us nothing about anything amp yet when full it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs tepid bust the film making is so hurried the situation just comes equal out of leftfield roleplay and doesnt make any sense to motion picture show the audience suddenly hes dealing in heroin where did this come from why what is going on here i being equal a middleaged leftie would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even crucial i just got fed up match with the portrayal equal of the man the pigs the fuzz etc as brutal besuited unthinking hippiehating androids it may have been like that in s america i dont true up know i wasnt there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemichaving said all that vincent donofrio was convincingly charismatic as the just the states younger hoffman and ripe i could watch william tell janeane garofalo in anything even reading a bus timetable though she just wasnt right for this just part
0,aldolpho steve buscemi an aspiring film maker lives in a battered nyc apartment and relies on his mother to help make the rent he has a beautiful neighbor named angelica jennifer bealswho may or may not be married but who aldolpho would love to star in his movie when al unexpectedly gets a financial promise of funding for his film from a strange man named joe he thinks hes got it made that is until joe takes al along on an adventure to steal a porsche for part of the financial backing will the film be made before aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone and will angelica star in the film this is in this viewers opinion an awful movie the script is abysmal with a plot that wanders willy nilly beals practically snarls all of her lines and buscemi though likable is nondescript there is a good deal of distasteful material and unsavory characters to boot finally the production values are very poor too making the film look second rate at all times if you have time on your hands it is still a good idea not to take a chance with this movie but if you are the proverbial glutton for punishment go ahead and watch the darn thing beals does look beautiful after all
0,i read about this film online and after seeing the generally positive review article it has received and viewing the trailer i decided to check it out for myself what a letdown it starts out well enough the opening scene was actually pretty tense but from there its all downhill i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie but by doing so they took all the enjoyment out of watching it those choices combined with the csi redaction practice of music and collage want of suspense scares or wit really drag this film down theres too much foreshadowing and to many subtle clue so when the first squirm arrives early on you already know how the movie is operate to end i gave the movie tercet superstar because i think the form did a practiced chore other than that i cant recommend this movie
1,got this the other day out the creators modeall dvd i saw scifi advertised in a free more whilst family were stopping in different hotel had never heard kids dvd it after reading a was filmed on balmedie and i just had to up it i used to take the next to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in aberdeen st off im not a big the fan baring star wars i was really just wanting standard see what they had done with this film location i was presently surprised from didnt turn out to be it to scifi this like a mix of scifi beach survival horrorhad a good storyline which releaseexcellent a had great with effects for the budget that it was on special acting was better than average anything a low budget film hint way they have edited out magazine whole coastline to see it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was niceweapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in invisibe on in all i to buy any future releases this these some maybe a all from horror for the hint the extras on the dvd were very informative produced giving background for the producers i would like will make guys of them shorts included as extras on a next about was work keep it buy
1,this is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of todays politicallyminded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the s cant be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the films breezy energy and charm i dont know what those who label the film boring were watching theres so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that min at a time
1,poorly cast terrible script motion picture show full of holes hot blonde gets eaten ingest alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon suppose of trained gunman and comes out information technology victor terrible special effects they fix the problem personal effects suppose by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable information technology twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch multitude it make sure youre in for a good laugh i recommend this motion picture show movie to people who can watch a movie ingest and not take it so serious i can not watch out in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to non take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can amp enjoy love this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some information technology popcorn and a couple beers and have a watch out fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life

0,arahan adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre to compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of stephen chows films is a mistakefirstly the fight scenes are nothing new all that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of yimou zhang tony jaa and jackie chan fights in intelligent motion pictures need logic there seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the matrix sequelsthe attractive female lead soyi yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as ziyi zhang had done so easily in house of flying daggers having a martial arts background serves well in kung fu movies to cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake see aya ueto in asumi unless you are a very talented director which as arahan proves seungwan ryoo is not
0,thats right you heard me this movie is a freaking abomination first off the band who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called the naked brothers band not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians they cant even play anything also the lead singer sounds more girly than geddy lee and even more his voice is horrible not only are they terrible musicians but theyre terrible actors led by a crappy director and thin plot this has got to be the dumbest movie ever i wish this website would let you use a vote of zero or below out of because giving this filth a is being way too generousim not sure that you can call this a comedy film if youre looking for comedy with music go to that weird al yankovic guy cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens

0,i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better dont get me wrong its not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to its potential the premise is good the cast is great i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton and god love em you can tell everyone tried their best it just falls short over and over again brutal massacre should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and despite the fact he makes it look easy you should probably just forget trying to do the same naughton and brian ohalloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more oftenthey are the reason this gets stars from me if youre going to have the spinal tap of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made spinal tap to helm itjust thinking out loud there
0,i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent bgrade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess
0,for a scientificallyengineered superdog that was supposed to be the answer to petit crime chomps was a chumpall i ever saw chomps do was sit or walk or run or run then walk then sit and then get back up again and stretch and then walk and then jog to ktel dance hits and sometimes it had all the answers to the daily jumbo but mostly it just sat a lotall i am saying is in a celebrity death match chomps couldnt take out mr bigglesworth
0,demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is definitely an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i dont even consider it a movie i describe it more as a thing a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and i first discovered this thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friends house it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one well during the minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word its just a cheap poorly done ripoff of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed ive seen bad horror movies before manos troll hobgoblins shudder i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid filmsfun fact this film is like a cockroach on steroids much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh
1,well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didnt see any he doesnt even like hockey or know about it still loved the story living right across the border canada i have watched hockey for years both there and in buffalobut i didnt think much this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec disaster that especially holds true in glory years of les canadians however that doesnt make the story funny back in the s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal and their star player richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple emblem it so kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it when he does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies whats so funny about that i could the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox diehard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors couldnt it and viceversamaybe to someone who doesnt follow at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut a fact of life or any bittime sports fan and his favorite team was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing made me laughthe art was fun to look at almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the canadian was good too movie was part of the dvd leonard maltins animation favorites from the film of canada
1,gandhi as a husband and father has always been discussed by people in india gandhimy father is a story that only a few would have known to such details surely an insight into gandhis personal lifeoverall i liked the movie for story and cinematography jariwala akshay khanna and shefali shah have all done a good job most scenes of the movie would be nice desktop wallpaperscommendable job traditional indian folk music as background score during certain parts of the movie gives a good feel of the happeningshowever what i didnt quite like was the narration style at several points i found the tone overdramatizedoverall good work by anil kapoor productions i would recommend it as mustwatchonce
0,i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom we my gfriend and i walked out about an hour into it what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargonsub atomic particles are thoughts by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals a drop of in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated wow what a rigorous scientific study im sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate hogwash hooey bull pucky btw it was funded by the ramtha cult the leader of which was one of the experts which were interview by the filmmakers no ulterior motives here right
0,i really the cry game nice graphics good leveldesign interesting clever enemies aboveaverage length and even a somewhat decent plot i am not by default against movie spinoffs games i thought movie was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible well not the length the movie runs only a merciful min the characters are more stereotypical than the game which is quite an achievement the entire plot is told without any twists or mystery several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story and come genetically soldiers they could have come up with better namehowever this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene i never seen of the like i could not believe they were trying to serious we have to get out of the wet clothes i think ill hypothermia although everybody is wearing tshirts we need cuddle together body warmth is that your gun but werent there people who consciously did there must have been a scriptwriter a director actors a gaffer an some food guy didnt anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening was this done by ravaging inhuman genetically modified film people i start at ranting about how many logical errors and scriptwriting flaws there were but even the diehard actionfan cant be but insultingthis film did actually ask for being rated out of so ill do it that favor but that leaves me to explain where the second comes from specialeffects nah acting not really to the game you wish wait they used the font from the game for the title and the credits that was neatif you are looking for a flick for bad night for supernova this one is sad
1,the opening of imamuras masterpiece avoids mere sensationalism in its depiction of the unfathomably horrifying events of august th in which of hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were annihilated in an instant instead imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the catastrophe focusing on such portentous images as the diabolic mushroom cloud louring silently in the distance and the black rain that spatters a beautiful young womans face the rest of the film traces the ramifications of the latter incident bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath over people died of radiation poisoning down to the intelligible level of the plight of yasuko yoshiko tanaka and her small community bound by the bombthe survivors strive for normalcy and continuity most notably by attempting to find a suitable marriage for yasuko but the imminent possibility of radiation sickness shadows every aspect of their lives yasukos potential suitors naturally enough shy away from a young woman no matter how attractive who might suddenly grow sick and die genuine love when it finally does appear does so unexpectedly and ambiguously we are left wondering if love across class lines is more a token of yasukos status as damaged goods or of a common humanity thrown into bold relief by harsh circumstances that transcends class divisionsthe films classically restrained style intensifies the impact the spare eloquent interior shots reminding us that imamura began his career as an assistant to the great ozu imamuras mastery is evident for example in the paired scenes of yasuko bathing the first emphasizing her lovely back and legs the second how her hair is falling out the shots stand almost as bookends to the narratives trajectory distilling its tragic essence the films documentarystyle realism is violated for expressive purposes several times perhaps most notably in a scene that lays bare the troubled interior life of a shellshocked veteran both the score by the renowned avantgarde composer toru takemitsu and the stunning black and white photography contribute greatly to the films brooding atmosphere when in the final shot yasukos uncle kazuo kitamura the films laconic narrator looks to the vacant sky for a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration the black and white imagery suddenly becomes so poignant that it is almost unbearable few films from japan or anywhere else for that matter could be compared to the great humanist japanese masterpieces of the s this film is one of them when i finished viewing it for the first time i sat stunned unable to move for at least five minutes overwhelmed as i was by the emotions great tragedy should inspire terror and pity

1,dont know what film or version jeff saw but this entire film was static awesome not just poitier and going the numeral story was riveting suspenseful numeral and engaging and for the guy complaining about historical amazing accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian unexpended territory but they had no authority to arrest whites outside native american of historic indian territory as a rule they did have it away not patrol but exercised warrants on criminals only i native american did find it odd that corby didnt seem to have any indian friends i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange even as corby returned to his people taking into custody his indian cohorts remain washington faceless and nameless

0,the summary pretty much sums it all up this is nowhere near as good as the original with a script cowritten by both stallone and james cameron at the same time he was also writing aliens most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects were written by stallonesly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and rocky and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids depending on your own viewpoint or opinionrambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by charles napier playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former exforces to placate rambothe mission is to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself he is told its not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos onlyafter a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit meets his contact who turns out to be a cute woman and travels down river with pirates to the camphe finds there are still prisoners and rescues one as the flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pickup point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with rambo almost on boardrambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter it is clear as trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be foundsteven berkoff turns up as a russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz killing many of them rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his basehe resists the urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centrea weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man
1,i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart real katharsis no other story had such a equal unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was existent one of my favourites because it was so unusual a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that cant be undone and the need for eat up others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother existing but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into holler the mountain the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe equal ill eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair lonely it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as katharsis amp i did as a child stories like this savage with this washington depth and feeling attractively and this intricacy of meaning are very apiece rare it is a sad story but ive never encountered chronicle any catharsis more beautifully made i amp am glad i have seen this movie and im glad i saw it as a child

0,roger corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious lowbudget career spanning over movies while few if any would call him great his films obscure connections to underground culture via reference tribute or influence have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts throughout his career he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films piranha humanoids from the deep the black scorpion etc without improving on them in the slightest raptor written and directed by jay andrews jim wynorski the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures chopping mall takes that practice to a disturbing new low regarding cormans mid s carnosaur trilogy wynorskis credits are in quotes because raptor isnt a tribute to the carnosaur films and not even a remake raptor is the carnosaur films or at least the films dinosaurinduced death scenes haphazardly spliced together with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes many of which consist of dinos eye view shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious the new material was written around the footage instead of vice versa and is totally unremarkable with huge gaps of logic eg two separate teams are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts and where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the carnosaur films already the actors lack of any feeling in their characters though in fairness any character dimension is only presented in the script once maybe twice brings to mind the terribly wooden acting in s bfilms and it certainly doesnt make anything between the rippedoff attack scenes worth watching even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical build between the new actor and the actor in the original scene when the only scene evoking any response in a film is the oldest trick in the horror book the springloaded animal something is seriously wrong as it stands this is a despicable practice in two bgrade figures who need not worry about ruining their reputations because they havent got one ripping off their own material for the cheapest and quickest of dirty tricks simply because they can why else would anyone feel possessed to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the jurassic park series there isnt much more i can say other than that this film carries my very highest recommendations against viewing the only good thing about it besides gazing at melissa braselles navel is that now i dont have to see any of the carnosaur movies
1,the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a slow moody but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion the film will not be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it okin the early moments of the film we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if theyre lucky while climbing through a barbed wire fence the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him the gun through the fence the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fenceanyway once his brother is killed yrold arnold regresses into his own world he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family seems to shun him perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold even though the older brothers death allows him to hit on the kids girlfriend arnolds parents dont seem to understand how to deal with their son they really dont even try to talk to him about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after a while arnold even moves in with the old timernothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncles exwife once he meets her he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the familys turmoil with the accident from here on the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakeningthe acting is hauntingly distant in most cases robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newmans performance in hud the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody pictures about common folk this one may be for you some even may be advised to bring some tissues of starsthe hound
1,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically theres a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm
1,i watch a lot of movies a lot of movies vex a graduate degree in movie forces one to watch flicks a day for years it all gets very exhausting mostly because i feel i have seen it all so rare is it when i stimulate surprised by something mostly i hope to encounter something as practiced as i require it to bedeath bed is so unlike anything i have ever go through i really had to stop the videodisk in order to rant about its geniusthe rhythm of the piece is psychotic its structured in a manner that forces the spectator to remain outside of the human body its not like something like halloween with all its snappy editing and pov shots death bed really comes across as kind of dreamy the most ostentatious manner i can phrase it is this is samuel beckett micturate a haunted house movie i mean its a manic depressive bed that wipe out mass and fried chicken out in the heart of nowhere and there bone hands i can barely articulate my feelings about this movie and yea copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule but things stimulate real samey after awhile its hard to be a cinephile and consistently remain engaged i can frankly say this is a fully unequaled movie up and down from what it is to how its put unitedly we need films like that movies that shake us out of our complacency consider it like existential camp its fun and its stupid but likewise brilliant in its weird piddling manner the worst repugnance villain of all time maybe but at to the lowest degree it isnt a bozo in a mask
0,im so confuse ive been a huge seagal sports fan for years ive seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times i can only describe this film as bizarre steven seagal apportion screenplay writing and producing credits on this film but i have a really toughie time believing he would opt to nickname over his own sound for so many of his lines with a thin whiney role player sound no less what i also dont get is if they had to nickname some of his lines why does his own sound come out on the rest of them i expect seagal to mature like the rest of us but the seagal in this picture barely exudes a fraction of the same browbeat confidence bluster charm and sexappeal he so easy showed us in all of his previous picture what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky selfassured attitude and his badass sneer that so easy shifts into that endearing grin where is that inyourface attitude and charm that made him such a huge star i promise that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to pass us if so his womb to tomb winnow will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone

1,going into this film i was a minute cautious i have incessantly been a minute iffy about claymation movies ive incessantly savor becoming repair movies but claymation was incessantly dissimilar to me but this one caught me by surprisal wallace and gromit are extremely lovable characters and its a great story with jokes for all long time theres the light headed burpfart jokes for the kids and the subtle but over the head of young kids jokes for us older people very neat claymation and while the story had holes it kept my interest beginning to endits so uncommon to ascertain pure and uncorrupted humor these twenty four hours this film was all the more refreshing wallace and gromit go doing their rule thing which is exterminating humanely the buggers that deflower peoples vegetable crops but this clock they ascertain themselves fighting some form of a freak huge hare that their humanely built traps cant even keep under chit great express mirth and a great hour and a half of fun if you have not exposed yourself to wallace and gromit i highly recommend this moviethe only reason i charge per unit it a and not eminent is because its still a family film and i dont have kids i savor it but if i had been watching it with some little carpeting rats and my married woman itd be at least a for sure give it a shot
0,i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews school seeing the trailer i thought what an unfunny movie full of clichs that i decided to give often a shot because also it dont portray the movie very well what a because of laugh the movie is worst utterly the trailer and after spending hours watching it them couldnt parodies one single line that made recall i the funniest parts of the movie were the csi me but but trailers is pretty any i couldnt relate to pass of the characters nor hope that they will be together waste i found the than stupid time plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high after or feel that way mentally
0,what this film has is its realism you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his homework on the subject of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style however the problem is unless youre a big fan of the sport theres not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention before anyone asks why i watched it i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but thats not really a good enough reason for watching
0,mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment and fair play to him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know what you are going to get with rourke mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more and you dont want most of itfirst and foremost this whole thing just doesnt make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a busload of schoolchildren flees ireland for london he is on the run from the cops and from his own army comrades he has also vowed to never kill again it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for himhowever when he gets to london he is tracked down by a local mobster bates looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burtons dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for and a boat trip to the us rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priests mouth shut he figures it is better than killing hima wealth of things arise here which just dont add up why pick rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes why didnt that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off without protection i may add to take confession no way rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession why arent the cops checking the place out rourke hangs around the church and hoskins blind niece in particular for days afterward without anybody bothering him what hes on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder stupid the cops actually meet rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing they dont even check up on him why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat youd think youd want to get rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other why does bates brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not restrain himself for a few days at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states ridiculous rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again utterly ludicrous and besides she falls in love with him in record time a few days the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates point of view things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say that in jest along bates houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house but yet will bed a blind girl rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked hoskins priest is an exarmy guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally uncalledfor and yet another cringeworthy sceneim gonna stop there at unlucky without mentioning rourkes hair so falsely red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing styleoooppps i have just mentioned themoverall a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in rourke on the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director
1,as one other imdb reviewer has remarked this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably better as it goes along yes it is released by roger corman and yes it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy however the juxtapositioning of the wifes career as a rising blues singer against the husbands gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical void or hole while shes away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done utilizing a very small number of locations and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming pool which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past again very freudian is also very unique in this genre and interesting i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amandas plight this aspect of the story elicits the cast is excellent i think
0,this is definitely one of the weaker of the series of carry on films it lacks the usual fun and boy and even the the seem embarrassed by youre poor dialogue by the time this came out this series was in terminal decline and sparkle does it cast the show coming fresh to the series avoid this one till near if end
0,associate in nursing unfortunately i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on amp the limited information amp i had seen on fandango since i am a scifi buff the younker notion of a movie about ufos toll interested meinstead this beryllium movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick appropriate for an audience of likeminded individuals but very unchristian associate in nursing like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of motion picture show tickets and concessions shame on you at least the da vinci code did promptly not hold back its wildeyed crazinessso this bgrade movie and i am being kind leave production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to non wednesday and sunday like evening youth groups but if you are a equal mainline christian or nonchristian you will not be comfortable

1,edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns people who are peckers main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez
1,a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see
1,the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous selfdesctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh atsympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked bestsimon geist is a man in his late searly s who creates a popculture driven editorial magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitchslap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his livein female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the musicvideo queen for a bunch of brated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if youre in the indieart house crowd mark my words
0,st movie comment ever ill start with saying come on wasnt that bad was it no it wast that bad actually i laughed and giggled enough times through the movie so i cannot say with hand on my heart that it was rubbishits completely different this and epic movie epic movie sucked bad doh how so people would ask ill tell you how this movie is not as nearly as pointless not to mention that the stupid and i say stupid because it is but being stupid makes it funny stuff that happens around and with the characters is actually enjoyable in this movie not the best around but hey what would you expect look at the poster some people said it was stupid i find that when writing a comment one should be more objective my own opinion but yeah of course it was stupid its a movie about stupid look im not telling you to go and watch the movie now or else you missed the event of the century what i am telling is that if you happen to see the movie somewhere please dont carve your eyes on the opening credits see what its all about who knows you might like it a biti give it for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sexrelated jokes
0,this may not be the worst arrive comedy of all time but its close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it backchris kattan is funny for about flow minutes his high pitched voice seek and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the vocalism rest of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of former snlers that have ingest attempted take movies some have non been brilliant some have failed miserably theres so not much middle ground in this category although chris farley was ingest brilliant and then okay and then foresightful not so funny motion picture show and then deadso i suppose he hits the entire beryllium spectrum in one careeravoid this movie like the plaguec
1,clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over votes and a paltry user comments written for it its a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasnt done the film any favours over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought its just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning storyrobert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we dont see his face but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchums shadow so really its solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high perhaps its unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but its dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable
0,the worst movie visualise ive ever seen i still dont understand what dennis hopper land and michael madsen just intend to do in maybe they had bills to pay the best and cult part happens novel during a flashback which brings kind of us during wwii when a nazi officer hide his jewish wife thats the beginning happen of a typical serial killer life it seems ingest to be rather directed during the beginning of the s but then appears a new beattle amazing this movie was directed in im quite sure that it took less than two weeks to do that movie i heard that dennis hoppers wife asked for divorce after she translate saw that picture and michael madsens mother had a heart attack when sequent the actor admitted come out to be translate the man under the yellow baseball hat so pathetic
1,watchers is a fun movie if its not taken too seriously the novel written by dean r koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in its own way the film has a lot of changes for the novel watchers the one difference is the main character travis in the book he was an adult and an retired delta force soldier while in the film hes a teenager watchers has its good points the film does have some gory scenes in parts im a fan of micheal ironside and it was cool to see him in this film he always does a great performance in all his films the oxcom costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film the dog einstien was impressive since it was well trainedthe film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab a dog and a monster both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them the dog finds a teenager named travis who takes him home and discovers that hes intelligent and so he names the dog einstein meanwhile the oxcom is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand soon travis learns that his not safe as the oxcom is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in its way so travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend whos being held at the hospital by the two agents they then hideout in the woods while the government agents and the oxcom are not far behindwatchers is not a great adaptation of dean r koontz novel but it is a entraining s horror flick some fans of the book may not want to watch this since its not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy s horror movies may want to check this out
0,wow just wow never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in minutes and then i happened to come upon lady frankenstein this movie takes everything you know about frankenstein and turns it completely upside down and not in a good way if youve seen this movie you either stumbled across it on italian tv or you have the dubbed version on the chilling classics box set like i have as number and lets just say theres a reason why these movies are here because theyre not very good enough of that though onto the movieit starts out with dr frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant whosobviously not igor for some reason his college graduate daughter shows up and states how she just graduated with a medical degree cause yeah there were so many female doctors back then so she states how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no and then he makes the monster and it kills him so she grieves for exactly seconds and then makes up a story with the assistant how it was a burglar the monster escapes and goes on a rampage ok i really cant believe they killed dr frankenstein so early in the movie he dies like minutes in and then his daughter takes over which doesnt make a whole lot of sense but sure so lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster whos now rampagingis to make another monster oh yes how i love her logic so her new monster she gets the body by killing someone and putting the brain of the assistant in iti know just nod and go along with it so the monsters meet and duke it out i love how the assistant asks why dont we just let the mobs kill it and she answers with they wouldnt know how to kill it and in the end he kills it with an axe to the head haha oh yeah nobody else could have figured that one out so in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein the endthis movie was justweird it was seriously like somebody wrote a self insert fanfic theres no other way to describe this movie there were some odd naked scenes too like this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend the monster picks up the girl and the guy drives away haha nice guy she then struggles a bit and dies fromto be quite honest i really dont know what she died from but whatever its lady frankenstein it doesnt have to make sense this movie had a lot of those why moments to the point that i just gave up movies shouldnt do that but for some reason i see that more than i probably should so final word its not the worst movie ive seen on this pack but its a tad boring and full of many many holes and random things so lady frankenstein gets frankenstein porn scenes out of
1,first i gotta say that this film is way less getting than the da vinci code sure you the the religion vs science book but it doesnt change to make a big statement about the its basically an action thriller that moves from one promises to another very well one scene particularly silly involves fire i found extremely well done big the changes complained book to film although second i was following in development of the film i from about the try of some characters and have complete removal of others i mainly admit i was wrong it was refreshing that the film didnt follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done the da vinci if you worry a purist of the problem some of them entertainment upset you though there the when twist is still however so dont are about that finally im glad id of some that subplots and didnt even try to it at the possibility of langdon and vittoria pretentious together the performances are really like but nothing out removed hint ordinary thats okay good a film for this they give it a gotta because it delivers what it scene may pure entertainment
0,oh my god i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i downloaded this movie seeing as was one of my fave years for movies ever but it sucked the plot although id hesitate to call it that is about some dumb elephant it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets electrocuted to death lame even for a short film the plot was too thin to keep my attention edison is like the worst director ever plus the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending wow that wasnt predictable at all sarcasmthe picture quality is horrible too you can barely tell whats going on most of the time the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other unscary horror flicks this didnt spawn eleven sequels other than that this is a complete waste of money and minute of your life youll never get back
1,as one other imdb reviewer has remarked this movie starts a bit slow first class but gets considerably better as it goes along yes it is equal gain released by lonesomeness roger corman and yes it goes over trap some of the same thematic first class chemical reaction ground deliver as much higher budget predecessors maine such as fatal attraction and poison ivy however the juxtapositioning of the wifes career as a rising blues singer against amp the husbands gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical void or hole ingest numeral while amp shes away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is fix nicely done utilizing a very small number of locations conserve and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming beaver state pool which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains apply its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to a great deal ones occasional lustful temptations but accomplishes this as well or fix better as other films in considerably this genre the twist of the motion picture show stepfather abuse of amanda in the past again very freudian is also very unique in ingest this genre and interesting i agree with other reader viewers about the unexpected and suppose sympathetic reaction for amandas plight this aspect of the amp story elicits the cast is excellent i think
0,my yearold daughter alexandra writesi thought it was very boring and i thought it was just a repeat of overeat from dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the best part was the reference at the root they were cute and well come the rest of the film is not worth watch over thank you
0,i promise wont go and give them my non bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best at least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing i have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original and she thinks jessica simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything hence at all and since power when is american pie exhausting motion picture show have anything get along to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that inward considerably nasty line in proto indo european there about having sex with a car that in itself should have gotten the movie a r rating the only good thing that or so might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals atomic number lets understand all hope so the loose woman people out there that went and habit seen the hence movie will see how it should have looked
1,when the italians and miles okeeffe work together nothing can go wrong as ever miles is great as almost as great ator the lovable of all times totally lives up to the first movie
0,speck was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck there is however not much killing to be found in this movie and none of it is explicitly shown the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub yet even this is merely implied and not shown save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr specks leg the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voiceover which should be a testament to the mindnumbingly boring nature of this movie every aspect of this movie is horrible unless you have a fondness for boredom dont bother this movie only clocks in at minutes but it feels like an eternity
1,i remember was film from many years ago certainly the best film on the subject in my experience the fact i that vividly they so much of the proportion years so long a to testifies time its the it is difficult and comment on the level of the performances because of impact language barrier but remember were nonetheless very powerfulthis subject continues dvd fascinate us even with the passing be after and it this most effectively treated here with the proper film of historical perspective to skepticismi wish it would be shown on tv at least once or at least of available on archive or to or is it is some art film tape hoarding a copy of it
0,what this film has is its arrive realism you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his homework on the subject of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style however the equal problem is unless youre a big fan information technology ski of the sport theres not motion picture show a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention before anyone tone asks why associate in nursing i watched it i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but thats not motion picture show really a good enough wherefore reason for watching

0,a bad movie about a bad movie is that original or what if it is then thats the only good thing about it the lovely ally sheedy couldnt stop this bomb from destroying movie theaters and vcrs everywhere it should also be noted that she and the other actors hired by danny aiellos character were billed as themselves as well as the characters they played in his drated film calling it a brated film is too much of a compliment and would lead to delusions of grandeur
0,what was an exciting and original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during first season dark angel was on my must see list and not just jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided they needed to finetune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the thin on one of the second season episodes even had sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itazjazz

1,minor spoilersmisunderstood classic remains one of hensons finest and most personal films it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one misunderstood but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry juhls snappy screenplay and paul williamss knockout songs now while these things are admittedly great as is the movies formal playfulness screenplaywithinthescreenplay film break etc what distinguishes the muppet movie from the other muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture its a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business even before the muppets have made it piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performers life on the road in his haunting im going to go back there someday and worst of all kermit is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes one can only wonder what henson would have made of his familys management of the company after his death kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the final magic store number questions whether its all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesnt matter either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldnt work if it werent but the muppet movie isnt just another jokefest as the rest of the diminishingreturn muppet films would become no its a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and its every bit as effective today as it was years ago out of
