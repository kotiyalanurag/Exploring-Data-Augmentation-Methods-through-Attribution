0,once upon a time was a great american film which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills film featured clever direction groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting it was entitled an american werewolf in london sixteen years later the awaited sequel was pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater surely would have least of the of the original again an american werewolf in paris an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful the problems begin with the leading man tom everett scotts performance is stiff and tiresome from the outset he seems intent on proving that all young are simpletons in his defense not even a seasoned shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue at one point one of scotts deceased friends whos soul is doomed to walk the earth being carved up one of werewolves is finally able to leave for the afterlife he then quips scott and his friends okay guys see ya what a memorable goodbye julie delphy soon shows as scotts mysterious european love interest basically shes a french girl playing the french girl it isnt of a stretch but this stupidity isnt even the most disappointing thing about the film the special effects such an integral part of the superb original film fall far in flop the werewolves like cartoons and no matter how well you sculpt cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles its still hard to get scared of a cartoon so instead the vacationing american gang led the ultra weak scott keep finding excuses to return to the werewolfs catacombs lair here its much this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness some have said that if you dont look on this film as a its not as by comparison i disagree this film can not stand on its own and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original if doesnt want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the film i dont care how much you love werewolves or how much worshiped american werewolf in as i myself did this one is simply not worth wasting your time okay guys see ya terrible out a possible th
0,bo dereks debut film remained unseen for eight years and thats how it should stayed john derek was a competent actor but as a director hes virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema not that this is especially explicit considering that bo atypically sporting dark hair was only when the film was made john also wrote and photographed it the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bos family they grew up as brother and sister but now in their teens the couple discover theyre attracted to one another but as i said dont expect any sexual fireworks still the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort and keeps expecting a cruiseliner to appear into view which of course it does at the finale dereks is even nuttier she craves possession of a large antique bathtub for the record the couple are married by the end of the filmalso involved in the nonevents are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo and who naturally incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten occasionally for no very good reason were even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an openair movie house to which the whole town assembles among the titles shown is the public enemy at the end of the day while bos naivete throughout is undeniably charming its not enough to offset the films overwhelming dullness and amateurishness
0,i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest rolelynn as im sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driverunfortunately other than lynns amazing performance im afraid this movie doesnt really have much going for itoh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like you sonofagun you sonofawitch shoot and well forget youok byeps does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster
1,im slowly ploughing through as many hong kong action films as i can get my hands on and came across this gem mainly due to ching wan lau who is one of my favourite actorsits a great action film although not as ott as the title might suggest it moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyablethe biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack it would appear that rob dougan the guy who did the clubbed to death song which was popular in the matrix has lifted the soundtrack from big bullet and compiled it into one of the tracks on his furious angels album the tune in question is called im not driving anymore and is also the opening tune for the tv series law and order and the opening track on the matrix reloaded dvd menu teaser that really surprised me due to the sheer conincidence

1,the great james cagney topbilled in big letters doesnt show up money box the movies second third base and probably has less screen time than dudley digges who plays the eeevill reformschool dictator but when jimmy arrives as a deputy commissioner of somethingorother out to reform reform schools he separatrix the air with his hands and jumps on the testicle of his feet and spits out punchy warnersfirst national dialogue with all the accustomed and expected flair the psychological science in this crisp old geezer ane of warners many efforts to swear its come out as the socially conscious studio doesnt run deep digges is bad just because the handwriting take him to be and theres the quaint notion that juvenile delinquent will turn into swell kids if theyre just given a dash of autonomy but its made in that spare fast style that the studio specialized in and it never bores frankie darro who got into all kinds of onscreen disoblige during a brief term of office as warners favorite rotten street kid is an ideal jd a bountiful charismatic toughie with a pug nose and a hatefilled stare that could wither steel no kid player today can touch him
0,i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i recently found the prey in its original vhs big box form and was very excited i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic the prey is one of those filmsto be fair it started off ok with the killer stalking the clich teenagers in the woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch this film is basically a big fat clich and when the campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the backstory of the killer i actually thought this was quite an original idea however the backstory ends abruptly and shows us some stockfootage of a burning woodland the lack of budget really starts to show now after this we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isnt shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer sort of like cropsy from the burning but better as for gore there isnt too much although theres an ok face squishing moment at the end overall i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists it really is a big mess

1,i dont see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor you need to get your head out of your uptight ass if you dont find this movie hilarious if this isnt your cup of tea so to speak then look at it for what it truly is a damn funny movie maybe they did set out to make yet another drugsta movie but in this case theyve truly hit the spot its especially funny for the ali g fans because he delivers everything weve come to love and expect from him so i say big ups to ali g and if its not your thing dont whine batty boy
0,this film was very well advertised i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it then i went and saw it i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie i always go into a movie with an open mind not trying to go into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny now it wasnt the worst movie ive ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see meet the parents instead
1,at last ive finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now disaster ive only pin up had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the s reportage with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and be a fluid colour with a mind of its own having cataclysm thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was content well vernacular worth the wait and the full minutes even more of a pleasure than appear i thought possiblethis was the lovely meena kumaris film from start to finish and i believe was whitethorn planned by her from amerindic on finally realising it in what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes deoxyadenosine monophosphate in pakeezah necessitating a body double in some scenes the interlingual rendition strain definitely shows in her facethe story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but im led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india its a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense hitherto romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too indian but deoxyadenosine monophosphate to me its the peerless golden music by information technology ghulam mohammed entirely as a sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its hold part in the unfolding of the story that makes economic value this film so outstanding ive seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin in the rain may merely be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music offbeat yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had protrude the one song in here albeit a classic duet with fable lata because savor of poetical all this but not blind to sound out its right away faults pakeezah be is my favourite indian movie assemblage filmed at inwards a time when hard knocks the westernisation of assemblage india was inwards gathering pace and watched now live on when western values seem to be jettison state sponsored and de english hawthorn rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of brain what indian pop music had to offer the world before it along was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra
0,on the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that inwards is how to become a persona true self not by embracing the socalled dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around cover the non various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully however if we dig a companionship little deeper we find that be persona what this movie is actually inwards about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from graceis collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks principal good deal with his daughter when a car sustenance wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson wrack cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical timber perfectly with grave robbery the wicked have principal disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is warned by the salesman lesson just like any other person a car has a unique identity that brain cannot be altered nor betray replaced in addition there is the twist that rubin actually sees legion a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually abstruse that quality turns out to be a projection of rubins own personal greed for more profit lesson thou shalt never treat selfsame thy car as a means only be but always as an end in moving picture show itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and more importantly rubins gauge car be deoxyadenosine monophosphate the main characters assessment of the cars qualities supercede is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the covetousness engine room lesson a car is not just to be judged by its timber looks inwards it is what is inside that deoxyadenosine monophosphate really counts there moving picture show is punishment in store be for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake persona collectors car rule this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson there are numerous other examples in the movie incessantly of the carpersontheme assembling and auto i am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains suit and i guess this is what im really trying to forest say that wrack this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else goose egg to do or if youre a car devotee
0,was this meant to be a finally or a serious drama vein film starts with a lighthearted banter between three it fine it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man fine there of a few antics between them fine but when the plot thickens banter comedy becomes black i unconvincing the wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first while this the talking it is in are late for a the until in part end women tries to ever back to producers original lighthearted and but by now its too this its hard to see why these women would still be movie to one another and the finale continues started truly a lesson for british work anyway of how not to make films difficult to see how the to go convinced themselves this film would filmmakers and the box office proved it to be a real flop because id never heard of this film until this weekend four years after its release
1,now this show looks like most of the other appearance of its type from the mid s but the only thing is about this unrivalled is that its different they use a spate of comedy and action in this unrivalled and maybe a little bit of dramatic play too i personally think it was a good show i cant see why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is even so active ever since up to datemy bob hope is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesnt hurt to dream doesnt itanyway i would commend if you hadnt seen it to find the videodisc of all episodes because the type are great the tale short letter are good the comedy is good and easily the whole show is just great
0,jack brooks quirks are at first somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this moviei found myself getting angrier and angrier as i was duped into seeing this one through to the end in hopes that the payoff would be worth the supertedious waitthe climax cant begin to make up for all the setup timenormally one might expect shallow characters from this genre but the fact that the waittimebeforeaction index is so high should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character developmentnot sowhile not without its initial charms this movie ultimately infuriates and disappointswish i could get all that setup time back to reinvest it into something that pays off
0,the movie appeals to public due to charisma of ben stiller and notoriety of j aniston it seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title but theres nothing successful in this moviepolly is very well played by aniston no doubt this is the kind of character which suits her perfectly bem stiller is the same troublesome guy like in meet the parents but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned abovethe script is very poor with nothing special at all with this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script out of
1,i really thought this film because of it the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with all around hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous be a musical film hayworth rita like did a dancing performance of also acting in this film as betty as far as her fine i think she was excellent even well grable pretty and endorsed ritas dancing in this film as she commented that find danced rings rita her own dancing and lets face it betty grable was an excellent dancer the cinematography and vivid colors are dramatic with rita wants to although a cover girl for a magazine find shes also in love noted her mentor played by gene kelly does does leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love much will stardom or she she stick around to change that unique pearl that broadway but her life forever youll have to watch the i to rita out
1,karen sarah michelle gellar an exchange student in deoxyadenosine monophosphate japan who is just beginning retiring moving picture show deoxyadenosine monophosphate to nigh do some nigh social work is sent to aid an elderly semicatatonic woman emma grace zabriskie after her previous caretaker yoko yoko maki disappears karen soon learns that something is not right in emmas home and she attempts to see how invent deep the rabbit hole goesmaybe its a delayed theatre influence from the success of presently m night shyamalans films but slowerpaced understated horror deoxyadenosine monophosphate karenic films are a recent trend in some cases such as hide and seek the approach works remarkably well and in others such as white noise the pacing tends to kill the repugnance film i didnt like the grudge quite as much vacate as hide and seek but this is still a very good filmit earns a out of from methe grudge has a a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend however one it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series small fry that began with juon in particular its extremely close to the first half of juon shuffle approximately the grudge aka juon from two steep as with many japanese horror films the slower pacing here isnt so much in the realm swerve of realist drama as with surrealism as is also the case with a large percentage of european secrete horror sooner the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmaredirector takashi shimizu also the director steep knocked out of the five japanese entries in the juon series to date the standardized fifth is currently in production and writer a stephen susco have weave largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with develop karenic logic or plot holes when it victimized comes to the horror behind wipe out the story medium the idea instead is to present clout a dreamlike sequence thread of scenes with dream logic where the focus is atmosphere creepiness the tranquilize uncanny and for many viewersscares how well the film works for you will largely to a greater extent depend on how well you can adapt yourself to or are used to this different world health organization approach to filmmaking although admittedly some of the seeming gaps be are filled in by previous entries in the juon series traditionally american similar audiences information technology consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning rules for the monster a more poetic metaphorical surreal approach to film isnt yet accepted by the mainstream in the ushowever even if youre not used to it its worth to a greater extent trying to suspend your entirely normal preconceptions about films and give the grudge a shot this is a well written well directed well use sustenance acted film filled with unusual properties such as develop the story interweaving a large number of main characters which is present done better here than the more episodic juon nihon good cinematography proper subtle production design touches check out gellars clothes which deoxyadenosine monophosphate match the color and texture of the exterior of emmas moving picture show house when gellar first occupy approaches and beautifully effective horror materialeven though it is more slowly paced that advantageously your average horror film of the past the pacing usually enhances the eeriness and there is no assay shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing and based on interviews on the deoxyadenosine monophosphate dvd with shimizu occasional have prodded me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and folklore although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of merely japanese culture its interesting to ponder why so to a greater extent many japanese horror repugnance films feature scary children and adults who look like scary childreni subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichd mysterythriller territory with a heres what really happened flashback but even that was credibly fairly well done and otherwise this would have been a out of now that ive said all of the above let me finish with a minirant its kettle of fish not that im antiremake but it is ridiculous that us distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films stew to make them appropriate for consumption nigh the motion picture photography original versions of former these films should just be playing in us theaters in wide release there is no need to present an almost past identical film but just present all substituting white american actors for along nonwhite or foreign actors yes the grudge attractively is a fine film but ultimately world health organization id rather see something original using this talent and be treated fifth part to the latest foreign horror filmsnot just japanese but also indian spanish chinese etcat my multiplex in the hope merely that someone with some pull at the ok studios reads this it is also more costeffective to do this as you can nigh completely avoid production costs and simply deoxyadenosine monophosphate make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit and you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise in force winner pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign manufactured be or even bootleg versions
0,this movie is more similar a music video kusturica said in an interview from that when he is making movies he look similar making music and when he is making music he look similar making movies the best thing in promise me this is the music drop a line by stribor kusturicakusturica said in the same interview that for him the duologue in the movies are similar noise promise me this has very small noisei wish life is a miracle it was too similar music video for the first minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful diagram promise me this has no diagram i was awaiting this movie with big expected value because ive read that the script has been drop a line by ranko bozic nonpareil of my dearie scriptwriter who enter too in life is a miracle ranko bozic spell corking duologue but for kusturica they are noise and very much to my regret i regard only two duologue which i could identify as drop a line by ranko bozic the other voice of the script was practice by the theatre director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son striborgordan mihic the serviceman who drop a line the scripts for time of the romany and black cat white cat said in an interview that kusturica neer travel along the script black cat white cat was the only script for which kusturica said that he will not touch it according to gordan mihic after all kusturica semen hind to the script and if he doesnt he doesnt fix a skillful movie and i think this is the case with promise me this he should have followed the script of ranko bozicpromise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few mo which made me jape the comedic mo are in the same style as black cat white cat but are not that funny at all i think the difference semen from the fact that black cat white cat was drop a line by gordan mihichowever i know some mass who wish promise me this they happen it very positive degree movie
0,was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama this film starts with a lighthearted banter between three women fine it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man fine there are a few antics between them fine but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the movie it continues in this vein for a while until in the end it tries to go back to the original lighthearted banter but by now its too late its hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing truly a lesson for british filmmakers anyway of how not to make films difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work and the box office proved it to be a real flop because id never heard of this film until this weekend four years after its release
1,i stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on world health organization the teevee follow late one night it has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later because of the important reallife lesson it teaches us about the dark side of human nature and but although blackguard it tells a true story that takes sustenance place rattling in wwii it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in europe todayif you world health organization thought ethnic lecture cleansing as its called today has anything to do with race or ethnicity youll think differently policeman after viewing this storyi cartridge mho guess id been pretty naive advantageously in thinking that evil follows any prescribed set of rules evil is as evil doesthis movie teaches a valuable lesson and but i recommend it especially to eg church bequeath groups or civil rights organizationsi dont expect it will be too easy to find clean and rent but id really like to see it again because there is one amazing deoxyadenosine monophosphate scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of race crucify expertise in this scene the protaganist who was taken prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the inwards war is discovered by an ss race authority and ushered edward thatch into follow a room there arrive the two play a sort of guessing game where the excessively ss officer is able to determine where our hero anthony quinns character came from and where his ancestors came from well come to consummate find out that quinns character isnt a member of an inferior race after all excessively but to the contrary hes a merely thing perfect archtypical aryan which doesnt mean a whole lot to quinns character who merely is perk more interested in talking about the keep towns rivers and mountain ranges that the ss guy had just excessively been naming nevertheless being a perfect aryan be archetype has its perks among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored nazi uniforms yeah its a better gig for sure be upkeep for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes until the allied armies arrive and recognize his be face from magazine covers

0,i remember going to see the movie in the summer of with my parents and being pretty into it at the time of course i was seven at the timeright before the jackson movies came out my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgicralph bakshi ran out of money about midway through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this is saying something much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of thembecause of budget constraints the movie already a compression of the fellowship of the rings and part of the two towers was pared down even more what you get is sort of like a filmstrip version of the cliff notes of the booksits not all bad though the animation brings a warmth to it that i found lacking in the jackson movies its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent fundingthis movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came several years later a halfhearted halfhour long tv special was aired which was meant to wrap things up all i will say about that is that it was a musical
0,when it was released this film caused a sensation i watched it and was thrilled beautiful usually young naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie today i saw it again and was bitterly disappointed the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses actually is all there is there is no real story the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies but they are not real creatures with a soul actually nothing happens it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills and this gets so boring after a while i even didnt watch the whole thing the second time for i fell vast asleep that is all that remains of this masterpiece it is a very good sleeping pill and you will never become addicted to itback then out of now out of

1,too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters i had never heard of it when it appeared on cable after the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since bringing up baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it not until its over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant alienation denial wishfulfillment for a start cathy bates owns this movie shes never been better the whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what theyre doing without laying on gratuitous hamming except where its called for as with julie andrews bits or jonathan pryces camp videos if youre not openminded you wont get it see mark adnums bizarre review which he devotes to adulation of stephanie beacham her career and her brothers obe for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives taking that as a cue i might as well spend time eulogizing amo gulinellos stellar cameo as a tv station intern or jack noseworthys shower scene so cast aside all previous concepts of film comedy and have a good time i loved it
0,i just saw this movie mainly because brady corbet is in it and i must that i was not of course the computer graphics were amazing but the story line needed a little touchup also i think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well if it were rated pg that would definitely attract more people to see itteens what would also attract more teens teen girls would be a large close up of brady corbet on thunderbirds even the movie had its down i still saw it and thought it was okay

0,here is a fantastic concept for a film a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputys single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over leave it to albert pyun to screw that up dont get within feet of this flick holy crap what a bombit might be pyuns worst yet the crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here an entire of an outbreak told from the pov of a dashcam when i heard that a while back i imagined the car smashing into stuff people getting run over and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos that would be cool right instead we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there the last bit is literally a minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera just noises are heard offscreen stay away on a somewhat relieving note i think i am officially calling an end to my pyun watchingonly took me crappy movies to realize i have better things to do

0,i saw this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thinwhich doesnt inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus points the support acting from edgerton in particular assured direction from jordan confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early th century must have seen it but i cant help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero or was hein what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didnt agree to lose the beards just to please universalguess i will just have to content myself with peter careys excellent secret history of the kelly gang
1,a horror movie is being shot and things arent going well its about a masked killer the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew he goes crazy and kills two people hes killed himself and the film is never finished twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish itbut theres a curse people who try and finish it are killed themselves the students ignore that guess what happens nextthe plot is old hat but this isnt badfor what it is a low budget slasher film its wellmade with a young and fairly talented young cast no one is great but no one is terrible either it also avoids the obligatory and needless female nude scenes it moves quickly the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesnt insult your intelligence also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actressno great shakes but not bad at all i give it a
0,this film is right up there with the oscar and moment by moment as one of unintentionally funny films of all timeit is worth the rental for a some wildly great laughsthe story is absolutely ludicrousnothing in life would happen like thisits so completely unbelievable the way james woods tries and hustle heavy hitters than they give this supposed twobit hustler a job miles away in la what a jokei love the old beat vw bug to signify how low theyve gotten in life because of all the tootskissean young is as unbelievably bad as the ill love you forever no matter what wife youll ever seeif it wasnt so funny you would throw up at how sugary sweet young tries to project herselfand as bad acting as youll ever seejames wood overacts throughout the whole movie and hes so extremely funny and is way way over the top its just not to be believed woods seems like a parody of a cocaine fiend off saturday night livebut watching woods on ludes is worth the price of the rentali love it when woods tells the guy who wants to give him some more ludes that he doesnt do that stuff anymore right before that woods just did three giant lines of cokethis is some very funny stuffthe ending is so comical but right on par with the rest of the movie
1,the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself makes sense but the dontthis might sound picky but considering the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any machine ever emulate human arrogance shortsightedness and greed quite so effectively i doubt it there are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can be to put them in and large the bioroids or whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters seems sloppy to methe main characters seem to have some of emotional entanglement though no light is this little shed on the backstory at all a pity the short length of the film coupled with focus on mecha and the crime means that we dont see character depth the groundworks all yet were left with no finished product a cropped version of oav would have made a episode once some character subplots been establishedthe highlights of this short are the mecha designs and the actionespionagethe flaws really start to through once youve had a chance to digest all the goingson so couldnt recommend for owning but its certainly worth a watch two whilst this review is mostly negative i really do think its worth your time to watch but its not something to rush and buy in a nutshell watchable wasted opportunity
0,despite of assess incentives in terms of outside visibleness the canadian film industry still meanwhile behind most central african and islamic states amazingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores and nouvellefrance aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other country commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries failures on theme this historical dramatic event could facial expression vaguely promising there certainly a rich vein of untapped cloth in canadas story as the french and english warred over and bribe and betray the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blinkandyoullmissit scene of characters saying tom wolfe is dead or nouvellefrance is no more before getting back to the soap operatics but while this isnt a story moral it isnt a dramatic event or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count seconds of shelling by a halfdozen reenactors and unrivaled collapsed shed the town square that is all we ever check of quebec is a rather obvious unconditionally lit studio apartment internal giving many tantrum an old tv miniseries facial expression as does director jean beaudins reluctance to offer a lot in the way of long barb or even outside what you do get for your money is a childlike but drawnout harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly disjointed by events beyond their control where the prominent surprise is that fabio doesnt turn up in the cast its the variety of film where whenever two characters are about to hit the beast with two backs the camera pan over to a commodious raging fireplace or waterfallan anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so a lot unite oncewarring nations as throw any country with a properly assess break into the stew this massive boxoffice disaster was distinctly signify to be canadas titanic though someone neglected to severalise the producers they meant the film not the send but turn over out more like revolution make on the cheap without the battle tantrum herd or the few minute that threaten to briefly knead in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror report it as so unfit that unrivaled cant even find the strength to mock it thats rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film looks like a belowpar s miniseries the last half hr suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their leg in give birth traps dastardly husbands announce youll never check your handsome lover again cheat abide by youll pay for this both of you and our heroine criminate of murder and gasp witchery in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moores version of the blood red missive throw in caddish british regulator devious slaves and celine dion singing at the finish and youve acquire something that at times most experience like the variety of film that timbo hines was wishful to and still managed to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of state of war of the worlds albeit without the staggering technical incompetenceleading man david la hayes versatility seems limited to the number of other thespian he can facial expression like end to end the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly sweep up the al pacino revolution facial expression toying with the cleanshaven tchky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages while his opening scene where he oppose to news of his beget death with an expression that looks like hes waiting for the director to severalise him he can go home now promises a feast of unfit acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor world health organization lucked into a lead at the last min when whoever was originally cast finally scan the playscript and bailed he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie bagpiper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading lady doesnt exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying centerstage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot that really is the characters name the janus faced goateed drunken flunkey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus sick abed revolutionary colly old priest in a manky greyhaired wig its a truly miserable sight to check a once majuscule actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he mix through the motions looking like hes not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he distinctly couldnt be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long barb where he is very noticeably doubled small wonder he talked of strike out around the time of the films brief releasesome brief comic relief is furnish by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplay tom wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnettarchie bunker played by timothy dalton on focal ratio while tim philip milton roth william george dibdin pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of unrivaled world health organization being put up in a rather nice hotel with first class way robert william service and plenty of days off though like colm meaneys benzoin franklin theyre both in the film for less than three bit arouet and madame jeanne antoinette poisson daddy their heads around the door for a couple of bit as well but fail to hit any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actress are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroines real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene francois jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and merit a lot better
1,okay this wasnt the greatest horror movie ive ever seen in my life despite the fact that its lower budget its a pretty decent movie though the monsters are unique and believable heck theyre even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family although when you finally do get to see the monsters completely you really think wtf those itty bitty things are after them the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty not the kitty noooooo why seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore this is not the movie for you go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines if you have small children i wouldnt recommend watching this with them though probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room
0,it has a bit of that indie queer edge that was hip in the s and which places an explicit sellby date on the visual style characters are uniformly apathetic and farcically deadpan street hoodlums in greece wear new clothing out of the box without creases or stains they all appear to visit the same marine hair dresser all uniformly exhibit the same low iq when making their dispassionate underground business deals when things go wrong its all because they arent real greeks theyre pastoral sunshine boys caught in a strange night city world makes a big whine about disaffected immigrants but never bothers to actually investigate the problems with russiankazakhalbanian cultures if giannaris had the proper perspective on this project it might have made a wonderful bel ami production the fleeting glimpses of toned boybeef is the only spark in this generic smalltime mobster programmer
1,the movie is a bit thin after reading the book but its still one of the greatest movies ever made sheryl lee is beautiful and nick nolte is really vonneguty he makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as mother night does
1,flashes of lightning a sprawling accredit cemetery the name of contention adam batman west all pop up on screen before the opening credits are even over and yet grisly despite these rather naff elements one dark high gear night isnt as cheesy tom turkey as it might first seemmeg tilly jennifers sister plays pretty student julie who reluctantly agrees to nigh spend the night along alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high school clique the sisters what julie due west doesnt realise is that the other isisters plan to freak her out with some ghoulish pranksor that the most recent body to wink dark be interred in the mausoleum is that of psychic vampire raymar who feeds off the life force of scared young womenadmittedly this isnt the inhumed most original of setups but thankfully there are enough inventive touches to help set this film apart from the competition my favourites being the drop macabre sight of everyday objects embedded in the walls of raymars apartment passably and the creepy manner in which mouldy corpses float through the cold ghastly marble corridors of the mausoleum during the excellent finale hal trussells impressive steadicam cinematography and tom burmans entirely wonderfully macabre special effects wondrously also add good deal immensely former to a the chilling atmosphere

0,all for love as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleons army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison theres also a storyline involving a murder i will be honest and confess that i wasnt too taken by the movie since im not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but i will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and its got a good cast that features miranda richardson anna friel richard e grant michael gough and jason isaacs the costume design as you can expect is also excellent ill be very surprised if this movie doesnt get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc at teatime captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and theres a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what theyre doing
0,was an amazing year for charlie chaplin it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than films while most of these films werent particularly good they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona however by this film the familiar little tramp character was still in development sure charlie looked the part but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed instead chaplin often hit kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at allas for this very slight film it is interesting to watch for the cast while they are not familiar today chaplin stars along with mabel normand chester conklin and mack swainall exceptionally popular stars with keystone films the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes the plot seems very vague and improperly developed chester and mabel got to the race track a very common theme in keystone productionsit must have been located near a race track charlie and mack show up and sneak in mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie slaps chester around and steals his girl in the end for no apparent reason the cops take chester and mack awayleaving charlie with mabel who oddly didnt seem put off by charlies boorish behaviorsunless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin what he and the other actors actually do on stage while not unusual for a keystone film isnt particularly funny when seen today
0,spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequelmakers think that they have to explain and therefore destroy the mysteries behind iconic horror films the original hellraiser of was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made the sequel hellbound was also a fantastic horror film though i personally didnt like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites some of the alltime creepiest horrorvillains in the original the third part hell on earth was already quite a mess whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy leadcenobite pinhead a typical s stupidity and therefore destroyed most of his scariness this fourth part hellraiser bloodline is slightly more atmospheric than the third one but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary background information about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hellseriously did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made i think not and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film the setting of bloodline goes back and forth in three different periods the film begins in a nd century spacestation when scientist dr merchant bruce ramsay attempts to close the gates to hell forever when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons in th century paris merchants ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an evoked demon the princess of hell took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina vargas since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages the film which takes place in the th century the present and the nd century really is quite a mess i admit that the part set in the th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements the films undoubtedly strong points are the terrific makeup and goreeffects the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the shedemon and pinhead doug bradley who in spite of having lost some of his creepiness still is a menacing villain it is an almost offensive idea for hellraiser fans however that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous lightshow overall bloodline is not a complete disaster but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee overall this is only recommendable to hardcore pinheadfanatics and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demons creepiness all others are welladvised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second part of the hellraiser franchise and skip all the others the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy as hell but almost everything else is disappointing my rating
1,steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldnt win by directing special effects epics he was nominated for three of them close encounters of the third kind raiders of the lost ark and et the extraterrestrial so he decided to get very serious by directing the color purple a period film with no special effects spielbergs first serious drama is a remarkable movie but the academy voters who voted back in still didnt give spielberg any respect the color purple received oscar nominations including best picture but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasnt nominated for best director it got worse on oscar night when this film didnt win a single oscar it got completely shut out that wasnt right the color purple should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldbergs spectacular film debut as celie a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband frightfully placed by danny glover then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia one of those friends of celie since im from chicago i had already known winfrey from her talk show which at the time of this films release hadnt gone nationwide like goldberg what a film debut margaret avery is terrific as shug avery another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celies rotten husband all three actresses received welldeserved oscar nominations for their work here goldberg for best actress winfrey and avery for best supporting actress set in the south during the first half of the th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end it also made me laugh at times too why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for schindlers list and saving private ryan making him one of the best movie directors of alltime but he should have gotten nominated for this movie the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like et to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkable out of four

0,alan rudolph arrive is a soso down feather a good deal director without that special touch as an example there was one shot in the secret lives of dentists in the dental office which could have indeed expressed the entire relationship between the incommunicative husband and wife rudolph squandered it the camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways stunner of the two dental force washed out offices with dana and dave each alone in moving picture show their respective rooms you get the idea of their desolation and isolation but theme not much more the lighting the colors the body language the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon if i were directing i would have spent all day if necessary to get that tv camera shot right thats the beauty and power of live on film it can express so much whole lives in a stir matter of secondsthe shot with the toddler stepping daytime in the puddle of puke could have been improved unique on the child should have shown more fascination with the puddle should have stomped and shuffled her feet should have had her head way bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention campbell didnt deliver he plays a uncommunicative man true but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice stump gesture body movement the tv camera film relies on voiceover narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho notional alterego dental practitioner played by denis unique leary
1,contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own riski loved this film the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen her face is huge in the back and leos is in the foregroundone of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtubyou can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepythe use of text in the film was unique like when leos character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a filmthe use of black comedy in this film was well done ernsthugo jregrd is great as leos uncle it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom riget this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww and all the chaos easier to take it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about itthe voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leos head which at times is a scary place to bethe movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they dont choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjorks character doesnt speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters dont fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but of course they never do

0,spoilers sorry the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is gremlins its the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies but i enjoyed it it wasnt too complicated as i hadnt seen the past two but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same critters starts with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a boy played by leo dicaprio and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boys car and end up in their flat thing they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girls dad they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the critters eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene and i cant remember not a good thing but im sure they have to go back for somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he cant because they are endangered and so he sends them homethe ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off its a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if youre looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies sorry

1,it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives as both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to complexities of subplots and screen time it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the real truth adding to the viewers inability to evaluate sources eg comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentaryto most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual participants testimonies and reallife footages however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers in the real buddy holly story paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world the testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy the documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events such as there were members of crickets and that buddys music was actually heard outside of usa at that time he had to embark on a world tour however it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to buddys wife after his death criticism andor negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should have remembered eventually we dont manage to construct the whole truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past realties that the documentary tells uspersonally i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era it gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story there is also an element of flexibility which allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues in the buddy holly story racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situationsmoviegoers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to deliver in most stories people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the way the story ends through the buddy holly story we do remember the struggles buddy and the crickets had how maria had been a source of encouragement and that buddy holly was a great performer until the day he dies
0,i bang special force and witnessing new engineering that lay down science fiction appear real the special force of this movie are very ripe i have find out most of this movie since its been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must accept i may have missed a few scenes but im commonly drawn into movies and have find out some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel downhearted almost care a film noir im not trusted why perhaps its that i dont want kevin bacon to be evil and theres disappointment in that but i think its witnessing just how unrelentingly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the old age of perhaps if they are mature

0,the fbi story was warner bros minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is max steiners remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so after that you can send it to hell wow
1,i really love actionadventure films and this is one of the best of course we love the stars of this genre bruce willis sly stallone clint eastwood kurt russell arnold schwarzenegger and the rest but its the story that really counts the best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little over the top as in the comic book style of action the more twists and turns the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film the more we actionadventure fans enjoy them in the line of fire has all the elements required for a riproaring action thriller it has clint eastwood as a nearretirement secret service agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him it has one of the most evil despicable maniacal villains in john malkovich the type in which you cant wait to see him get his due it has rene russo as the love interest it has twists and turns an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor it is extremely well paced by director wolfgang petersen and even has a score by the great ennio morricone this one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller dont miss it

1,not too many people seem to know about this movie which is too bad because i think its pretty good sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done i think the casting is good with likeable actorscharacters tom selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player go figure not too much of a stretch i suppose and ken takakura from black rain plays the chief the coach of the japanese baseball team there isnt too much to complain about its just a light easygoing happy comedy and i recommend it
1,the only conceivable flaw of this film is its title please stop comparing it to the first i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you havent seen the movie and are curious totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own this is a great exponent of screwy mid s comedy i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom is because of its title i usually hate movies like these ie adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically i dunno maybe its like a bad relationship i cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is the single most underrated movie of the s behind the stunt manrobert stack we love you

1,in two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens steven spielbergs et and john carpenters the thing of the two of them et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over even though the thing debuted first because people were so entranced with spielbergs warm fuzzy feelgood alien fable they stayed away from the thing in drovesits not hard to see why the two are diametrically opposed one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the stillbeating heart the other is a harsh uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the things tentacles and slime coated salivaits taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience as it should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake it takes all the best qualities of the classic and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genres showrunner alien and thats even rarercarpenters film follows its source material more faithfully than the thing from another world did it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation but although a bit thin on characterisation the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds themfrequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns hot off the success of escape from new york cast once again as one of carpenters perpetual antiheroes he plays macready the helicopter pilot at an antarctic research station what theyre researching is anyones guess the trouble begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over macreadys trying to gun down a siberian husky from the airthey end up dying for their troubles and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened they take in the husky and add it to their own except that this husky is not a husky at all but a shapechanging alien the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when they thawed it out it massacred their crew capable of absorbing its victims at will it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the man crew until noone is certain who is human and who is notthe thing is one of john carpenters finest films in fact im tempted to say its the best film hes ever made even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star the reason why i place the thing at the top of carpenters list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was slumming it films that didnt flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier worksbut the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree not even in the ferocious assault on precinct from the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly and when he delivers his punches they come with an agonising joltthe film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror an approach that can often seem at odds with one another but in carpenters hands melds together beautifully bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects youll ever see in a horror film amorphous shapes halfformed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws spider legs and fully flexible tentacles indeed the films effects are so amazing and squirminducing the thing came under fire for being too realisticthat type of thinking misses the point entirely it only shortchanges the films values and there are many carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to its in the films quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows whispers and implications characterisation has never been one of john carpenters strong suits but it works to his advantage in the thing because we hardly know anything about the cast it only makes the present situation that much more confusing were never certain from one moment to the next who is who and because of this the thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewingsa special mention should go to the excellent film score from ennio morricone a pulsing thud thud every two seconds it creates an eerie spooky feeling that is very hard to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they bloodtest each other to see whos human is wound up with such dexterity by carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even realisingthe thing is a pure unadulterated classic even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well worth the reappraisal it received and so much better than et
1,the first film was a nice one but it not as good the wonderful animated classic which i found more and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is a uninspired but the dogs very cute and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw the is nice to at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumesespecially cruellas and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very good ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances fun as accomplice but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close in a overthetop performance as even more than she was previously overall bethany cox
1,as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid at heart i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasnt been a good superhero movie out for quite some time note batman forever was not a good superhero movie i really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema read blair witch project i wasnt disappointedmystery men was definitely not a higheffects tensionfilled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scene stiller and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william h macy plays a great straight man while kel mitchell and the fartpowered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happythough the sets are bizarre and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer offguard and bring tears from the bellylaughers among usi definitely recommend this movie although not an alltime classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread the writing is good and the cast is great if youre worried plan on the matinee and pay less but either way youll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesnt root for the losers once in a while
0,ok so it was written in before so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient thats it thats the good stuff the actingfair the plotsilly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isnt as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated dont you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isnt to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic im a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so i didnt have to watch all the ads that was a plus its a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish

0,what was an exciting and fairly original serial by fox has degraded down to weave tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must look list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox resolve that they needed to finetune the plotline inside episodes of the season opener they had whole lost me as a viewer not even to look jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the secondment season to be too derisory and amateur the new plotlines were debase the continuity and credibleness of the show too thin on of the secondment season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe moral of the story the that hollywood neer gets if it make dont screw with itazjazz
1,i love the premise but its replay value is only for certain partsthe opening scene of course some characters are a bit outrageous but they are entertaining none the less i think the ballping sht was pushing it i know it was to show that nick and casey were living foul out in la and to show why casey quit the lifestyle i just think that the flashbacks story could have been better also the jamaican guy rapping on the phone is clever and entertaining but once again i think the story was told sloppy it really seems unbelievable i actually believe swordfish the other movie woods has written more than some of the parts in thursday because the government keeps sht a secret all the time and has organizations set up that the public will never know aboutthursday is the best quentinesque movie ive seen i think woods is imaginativeclever and has witt however his work needs more maturation to even to get to the natural born killer script not stones movie level how old is he anyway
1,there is not much of a plot to this movie there is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies whose wife is going to sue the hospital for neglience not more than that but it does not matterit does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if youre not up laughing you have a smile on your face matthau charley wife recently passed away and who finds the object of desire of several women at the hospital he is delighted to taste everything on the available to him then he meets anne atkinson glenda jackson who at first is a patient in the hospital their first scene together is very funny and then they up again on a television panel discussion show they disagree on nearly every topic that is charley begins to like anne and viceversa except that she is very big monogamy in the men in her life her husband was a cheater and they decide give a shot two weeks i will not give anything else i want to mention the chemistry matthau and jackson have on screen she is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic middleaged comedy but her touch with comedy is light and agreeable she is matched every of the way by matthau who is more charming than ever he does not have to play mr sensitive or mr macho to get the girl he just has to himself art carney is a all by himself as a practically senile doctor the scene where the baseball team ashes buried at home is he also a very funny scene in a parking lot with richard benjamin richard does not have much to do in this movie more often not is just the straight man to carney and the role does not tax his considerable talents he had had a good time making this comedy very much recommended fyi matthau presented with her best actress oscar and jackson presented actor to art carney for his role harry tonto
1,the story on the island information technology liveliness texel photographer bob who makes a photo shoot lecherousness for a magazine meets the mysterious kathleen her free spirit and lust for life thither intrigues bob who has suffered a very traumatic be experience shortly before her life is not so simple as it seems however through persona play kathleen bob information technology gets entangled in a dangerous world health organization network will kathleen be able to win surreptitious his trustreview moving picture show the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been multitude nice if the practise characters psychology mat would have been inscribe worked out a little more why do these people do the things they do what motivates secret their choices this is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my open grave view the story never reaches an emotional climax even though the characters go through enough to justify that so you untested dont get to know the characters on that deeper level the actors deliver good work and play in a very in front natural and believable way but i think moving picture show it would have suited the movie better if kathleen had been played inwards by a younger actress as this characters naiveness doesnt quite work for a grownup woman camerawork is nice and there are some great shots of the nature on the island i give the movie a
1,moving picture show a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it confirm was information technology definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding rattling supporting roles in this film i think right they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see

0,a collection of deleted scenes and alternative takes edited together and with added voiceover to make it appear to take place after the events of the first pretty cool idea but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof as its just not as funny as anchorman and really lets face it that film wasnt exactly comedy gold either so you get a movie worse than one that was moderately funny in my eyes that still puts it one or two notches above kicking and screaming or bewitched chross your fingers that the wedding crashers is a return to old school form no pun intended my grade d

1,i saw it film at the ridiculous internation festival of womens cinema last just and was saddened to hear ms troche after us in her qa including the screening that she doesnt expect to see too much us and due to her boston on tell all of the socalled gay content it was a fantastically entertaining keeping distribution it night seems to me the american audiences might enjoy it in much that same way they enjoyed the full monty so its really of and kind of insistence that a few shots of two boys kissing is rose this one from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and unfortunate course comedy troches direction make this away of the funniest films ive seen

1,clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over votes and a paltry user comments written for it its a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasnt done the film any favours over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought its just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning storyrobert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we dont see his face but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchums shadow so really its solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high perhaps its unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but its dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable
0,this movie is more like a music video kusturica said in an interview from that when he is making movies he feels like making music and when he is making music he feels like making movies the best thing in promise me this is the music written by stribor kusturicakusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise promise me this has very little noisei liked life is a miracle it was also like music video for the first minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful plot promise me this has no plot i was awaiting this movie with big expectations because ive read that the script has been written by ranko bozic one of my favourite scriptwriters who participated also in life is a miracle ranko bozic writes great dialogues but for kusturica they are noise and much to my regret i saw only two dialogues which i could identify as written by ranko bozic the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son striborgordan mihic the man who wrote the scripts for time of the gypsies and black cat white cat said in an interview that kusturica never follows the script black cat white cat was the only script for which kusturica said that he will not touch it according to gordan mihic after all kusturica comes back to the script and if he doesnt he doesnt make a good movie and i think this is the case with promise me this he should have followed the script of ranko bozicpromise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few moments which made me laugh the comedic moments are in the same style as black cat white cat but are not that funny at all i think the difference comes from the fact that black cat white cat was written by gordan mihichowever i know some people who liked promise me this they find it very positive movie

0,i must say that i was disapointed with this film i similar have never been a huge bnl fans i find be their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade rapidly if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however canadian river i have seen clips of their maine live show and i really like information technology the improvisational and goofy nature of the show i was hoping that this district thing movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and blackguard impassive boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it recollect and you know theyve had better moments as in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan hes piece the man in charge my names steve paige and im really large basic bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that meter godawfull blue deoxyadenosine monophosphate song by effeil or whatever every minutes banding i came non back to canada and then a month information technology later that song was all over the place again entirely i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is like that years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around formerly campfires in canada listening to people play if i had a million birdsong dollars bnl was a regrettably cult phenomenon in canada erstwhile and much of their humour has follow a particular canadian slant to it suffer kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here bunch together and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull suffer then all of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah theyre brand new but theyre all in their s while the rest of canada is going oh geez i thought those guys folded years ago do i have to listen to past all million live on dollars againthe concert footage is murder not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips hub of the universe from their be massive deoxyadenosine monophosphate free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly information technology dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think stuff and nonsense theyre all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material where they deliver birdsong deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins live on it the interviews with shiny moses znaimer a canadian similar media mogule and terry david mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap medicine territory unintentionallythis movie doesnt really document very much either rebellion i mean its basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring hear entourage its not like we see stuff them rising from obscurity and surprise suffer they are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the advantageously end its rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either

0,when family guy first premiered i was not a discriminating mood with the s containing a wealth clever surreal cartoons why should i be nickelodeon produced doug ren and stimpy and rockos life among other fine cartoonsyes this includes spongeboball had quirky dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog the simpsons became an outright phenomenon perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders it but a very fine investment of your and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all tv is junk park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath it evolved to a monty esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift sharp societal critiquessuch as defense of noble underpants gnomes and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and meta like did and has unfortunately jumped the shark family is superficially like the simpsons park it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and enthusiasts however what it in loquacity lacks in witthe show is famous for use of gimmicks especially for flashbacks many are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funnyespecially from the first two seasons most are not are references inherently funny im not sure but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its are painfully where homer and have charm and has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful behavior peter griffin no excuse hes just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny day lois also shallow and dull meg is a prop only be abused chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars the showstewie and brian are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind pointlessother gimmicks i cant stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long this happens a lot lately and i cant bear it any longer not just oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat peter up talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it if they are alien spectators thats not wit humor its totally boring and lifelessnot that the show cant be funny in fact some of the earlier episodes had highlights include the pilot peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television when peters religious zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc when peter becomes a narc at megs school and the pancake episode i suspect these are episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits its characters or merely were times the writers actual comedic inspirationone last thing the show is offensive its only offensive to those who wouldnt watch the show in the place so its almost a circle jerk the choir hipsters

0,final score an average of various classic cinematic qualities acting visuals creativity payoff humor fun ect out of had atlantis the lost empire come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold serious new direction in disney animation however it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius the emperors new groove and marks a step back in freeing disney from its repetative disney formula im a big fan of the feature length disney animated films have to see them all love it or hate it atlantis is an animated throwback to leagues under the sea and similar liveaction scifi adventures of the s and s problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea it feels like a remake of something even more so than actual disney remakestarzan the hunchback of notre dame the characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically populate these type of films the oddball mechanic the gung ho general the sassy tough women beyond milo thatch fox and rourke garner the supporting cast is flatout obnoxious the movie also suffers from its succinct pace instead of fleshing it out into an epic story disney jams a lot in the usually brief running time brushing over opportunities to developsuspence characters anything really they thow us into this new and wonderous world and barely let us get our barings the awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story the animation is dark and dreary and cheap this thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon lets hope they havent forgotten that d traditional animation can still be wonderous the iron giant among others proved thatnegatives the visuals pace and sheer lack of originalitypositives quite possibly the coolest death scene for a disney villain in a long time its the creative highlight of the movie
1,lolthe mere fact that i start off my review with lol says it all i used to watch information technology this information technology movie all information technology the time as a kid and even then i sensed the silliness of be it all the low budget horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then i watched it again yesterday and just couldnt proceeds stop laughing its so bad its right actually good lol like another reviewer said it doesnt take itself seriously theres no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so the soundtrack is so funny i laugh every time i information technology hear aid it the climax is just a laugh riot high risk its an all out act war zone in new york full of explosions and total chaosso ridiculous you cant help right but chuckle at the sight of it other hilarious moments the scene with kersey and the sleep together cop running side by side novel like cowboys against the whole wild west was so cheesy it was funnyit killed me information technology how the bad guys could be shooting at kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking eversocareful and slow act aim and astatine astatine not get hit entirely lmao of course with him it was one shotone kill with his elephant hand handgun lol another hilarious scene was the end when he finally act killed the fifty fifty leader of the gangwith a rocket massacre launcher loldestroying the whole side of the apartment building with it its apparent that kersey is fall back all but used to losing loved oneswhen his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates the acting is so behave bad that you cant blame anyone that could only think that kersey is commentator mad at the destruction of the car lolhe runs down looks at the carnage state of war and just walks awayagain so bad its similar good out of course of study stars
1,this first two seasons of this comedy were very strange and werent very funny and had a drama element where bill the mother was struggling with the usual problems life but that was a bit depressing and mix well with th comedy elements which is why it dropped after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the bbc have made chemistry between bill and characters were funny and there was so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series the christmas were hilarious and a real treat for christmas the show came to a stop when the main actor olsen bill away which very sad because he was a brilliant actor films such as up under and a very funny ripthis show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesnt to be repeated that often though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while but it should be repeated on bbc one two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
0,spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequelmakers think that they have french capital to explain and therefore destroy perfectly the mysteries behind iconic horror films the original hellraiser of was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made the sequel hellbound was also a fantastic horror film though i personally didnt like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites some of the alltime creepiest scary horrorvillains in the original the third part deoxyadenosine monophosphate hell on earth was already quite a mess whose makers obviously demolish senesce deoxyadenosine monophosphate thought it deoxyadenosine monophosphate necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy leadcenobite pinhead a typical s stupidity and therefore destroyed most demon of set forth his scariness this fourth part hellraiser bloodline is slightly more merchandiser atmospheric deoxyadenosine monophosphate than the third one but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary background information about the approximately cenobites and non the opening of the gates to hellseriously did we need to know lowly how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the deoxyadenosine monophosphate gates to hellhole hell are being made i think not and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film the setting of bloodline goes back and forth in three different periods the film begins associate in nursing in a nd century spacestation when scientist dr merchant bruce ramsay too attempts to close the gates to hell forever when government soldiers disrupt geological period his mission past he has to explain his reasons in th century paris merchants piazza ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with secret the hinder occult an evoked demon the princess of hell took over the body of information technology the beautiful angelique valentina vargas since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell past is the one who built it the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages the film which takes place in the th century the present and the nd century really is quite a mess i admit that the part set in the th century has secret brightly a creepy merchandiser atmosphere and is incessantly by continuation far the best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts set in the merely gate present and in the assay future are quite weak and essential filled with stupid and unworthy elements the films pedigree undoubtedly strong points are the terrific makeup and goreeffects the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the shedemon and pinhead doug bradley who in spite of having lost some of his creepiness still is a menacing villain it is an almost offensive idea for hellraiser fans however that pinhead is supposed be defeated by explicate nigh a ridiculous lightshow overall bloodline is not a complete disaster but it sure is favourite merely an ogre unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly even extract director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it as he all french capital preferred to suffer be credited as alan smithee overall this is only recommendable to hardcore pinheadfanatics and most of them are probably going opening night to be angered by another diminution deoxyadenosine monophosphate of their favorite demons creepiness loge all others are helium welladvised nigh to stick with stag the brilliant first and excellent second part of the hellraiser franchise and skip all the others the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy atmospherical as hell but almost everything else is disappointing my rating
1,oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time the best word to describe it is genius the writing the acting the story lines everything about this show is absolutely amazing i just discovered the show and i became addicted to it right away and i was really surprised that it hasnt gotten the recognition it truly deserves it is violent and most of the characters arent meant for you to like them but the show is written in such a brilliant way that allows you to look past the violence and the criminals and see them as real people they are the lowest forms of scum but it still finds a way to allow you to understand a lot of the characters and even care about their storiesthe violence in the show is necessary for it to be as realistic as possible but the show isnt about the violence like some people might believe it really is a work of art and im sure who ever gives it a chance will love it just as much as i do
0,since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies when i was little i was curious about its sequelthe little mermaidone is a classic animated feature with top quality everything a grand music score and targets a general audience in contrast the little mermaid is targeted primarily at young children because it is spontaneous reflects a childs self perspective the music is bouncier and less dramatic and the ending feels like recessthe little mermaid starts out when baby melody is presented to ariels side of the family abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama a giant tentacle grabs the baby i laughed wait a minute its not funny the babys being attacked okay ill stop laughing morganas crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes away potential drama since it happened so quicklythroughout the feature melody seems superhuman which i defend is how most children envision themselves this quality in melodys character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her facelike the first movie melody has a lot of ariels problems except the reverse queen ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface ariel and melody both rebel against their parentthe music is more emotionally moving in the first this sequel has a bunch of songs but not as much orchestral work went into it its great for little ones because it doesnt take an orchestra to impress themthe ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting the sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water its definitely more targeted at kids because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away this ending leaves you thinking its time for recess ultimately this movie is fun for kids so we should let them have fun
0,the honest to goodness axiom that bored people are boring people is easily demonstrated in women in have intercourse the script take from d h lawrences novel contains an endless rate of flow of concepts that are at best sophomoricwhat a pity so a great deal effort went into so vacuous an exercise what an empty array of characters generate such care in spite of high production values this film comes across as tedious as its personnela revisit in merely confirms a impression of juvenille judgment in adult bodies dawdling nowhere and fumbling every step of the way
0,recap not entirely familiar with the shakespeare story of macbeth but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original only set in present time it tells the story of macbeth a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne he is a valued hitman and in the favor of leader duncan but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that and plan the murder of duncan and any competition of the throne this is a story of betrayal and cold brutal deathcomments very interesting idea i must say to use the story but change the setting to present time but still keep the original dialog it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence promised to be extremely violent it is a promise that it keeps but not in the notion i imagined it is very bloody indeed but the violence is slow not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated which it is too but also literally a lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its kneeswhat could have been a unique strength the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence now turns into something else entirely now both slow the move down painfully much so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at timesalso i cant figure out the context the three witches act within set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie apparently it does but to me it seems completely out of place not a subplot but a complete substory with its own rules completely different than the rest of the movie seems completely out of place surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern druginduced hallucinations perhaps which i suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and i just waited for the real movie to begin againa clear disappointment but maybe something for shakespeareanbuffs
1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for mefor example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost
1,i thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey tarzan concept made so popular by hollywood weismuller et alyes there is a lot of silly stuff but then the idea is silly it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees i am tempted to say completely unbelievable but that the concept has never been tried and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthoodstill if you can get your head around that lot theres a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play there are plenty of other excellent performances too not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holmwhat is particularly disturbing and rightly so is the simian perception of humans we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor dumb helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it and it demonstrates well how the phony civilisation and morality with which we cloak and justify our conduct is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance it may seem a little overstated at times especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms but what we see isnt just a truth about the victorians its a truth about the way we are today its one that needs to be stated and cannot be stated often enough holms characters obsession with the rayzor as a symptom of civilisation as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned is an excellent case in point primitive bearded readers take notethe story is depressing ultimately its a tragedy because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human civilisation we know hes doomed before the third millennium is years old wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excessin the end its a tale about ourselves the path to extinction that other simians tread must eventually be followed by humanshighly recommended for its ethical take despite the hokey moments
0,when i was untried i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can look them through adult eyes i remember that i in truth liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his adept now that im a little older i can read that although its thoroughly average i quiet look at it one of his better films in an roleplay stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his involvement in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial orca movie serial slayer are all the rage nowadays and people would like to look at of them as a wholly s invention in direct contrast its goodness to look where the current infatuation has take a hop from most plain action movies as well as stalk n slasher of s and s while norris assay at both humour and any form of human compassion are hamfisted and laughable nobody could kick someone in the header quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film ditto for musical style legend billy drago as well as go steady mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but its better than anything norris did in the s
0,i saw this by accident one slothful summertime afternoon it was playing on the family programming channelize of hbo at first i was make in by what i thought was a disney vitality but then after a few transactions i found myself seek for the remote so i could find the information push button to find out what in the world was on my tv i have nothing against william harvey f i savour him in many of his plastic film but one thing he is not is a voiceover artist certain he has one of the more unique voices in hollywood but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package attaching his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult as for the respite of the cast uninspired i suppose working on this motion picture didnt appeal to the genuinely good voice over talent out thereso weak voice talent strong animationwho was this motion picture direct gay adolescent ducks i dont get it is there genuinely such a dearth of rolemodels for young up and issue forth homosexuals that we must resort to animated ducks cute news report and like the title this movie i found punishing to love just like an ugly duckling
0,a operating theater collection of deleted non scenes and alternative takes edited together and with added voiceover to make it appear inwards to take place after the events place of the first pretty cool queer idea but rattling deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for mannequin a atomic number reason and this is further proof as its just not passably as funny as anchorman and really lets face it that film wasnt proceeds exactly a comedy gold either so you get a movie worse than one that was moderately funny in my eyes that still puts it one or two notches above kicking and screaming or bewitched chross your fingers that the wedding crashers is a return to old school form no pun intended my grade d
0,thats what this movie really takes a big piece of cheeze this movie is about a sister and brother bonnie and clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them but for what reason just for the fun of getting away with it in comes richard hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man a real bad version of a ladies man and he gets involved with finding whos behind all the killings across la he finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement but there are parts in this film that really get me going like the scene with lief garret dressed in his mothers wedding gown acting like a sissy in front of his sister telling her that he needs her and cant live without her and watching as she slaps him across the face dominateing him i cant believe that was lief well i guess i could but its worth watching but only to see one of garrets worst films that he ever did
1,oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all fourth dimension the best word to describe it is genius the writing the acting the narrative parentage everything about this show is absolutely amazing i just discovered the show and i became addicted to it right by and i was really surprised that it hasnt sustain the realisation it unfeignedly deserves it is violent and most of the characters arent meant for you to like them but the show is written in such a brilliant way that allows you to facial expression past the violence and the criminals and discover them as real people they are the lowest variety of trash but it still finds a way to leave you to understand a lot of the characters and even care about their storiesthe violence in the show is essential for it to be as naturalistic as potential but the show isnt about the violence like some people mightiness think it really is a work of art and im sure who eer gives it a chance will love it just as much as i do

0,such a long awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had go to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedya spoilt comedy but one affair that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional person thespian theyve done their part of the movie very swell good acting but i dont think that can salve the movie india has been slam beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturate with color alright nevertheless the direction the intrinsical beauty of these places was slam arrive at me want to find out just where those places were and when i could go there action sequences were slam very shabbily no one could make out head give chase of the stunts theyve used akkiakshay kumar very swell but couldve been done much much betteranimation is the unfit ive seen in recent picture show s picture show had good animation scenes i guessinitial scene where the car is falling off flying should be good word of honor the road into lakeand the picture show constitute has been mentioned nearly every to mins just to make surely audiences dont forget the movie constitute i guess
0,it started out with an premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized this was a b movie at best in the latter half it quickly became a c movie d then f i wish this wasnt a that i could put it in the microwave i cant say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the however i never read book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by year it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting a pound bag of fertilizer i really hated this movie as did my wife i am a and i have no problem movies that promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman
1,theres an inexhaustible hunger for training movies so its surprising that this got so little notice first released looks likely to have a welldeserved second life on dvdvhstigerland isnt uniformly great by any means there are some terribly cliched characters especially the portrayal of the ncos makes you long the return of lee full metal jacket but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get
1,there is not much of a plot to this movie there is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for neglience not much more than that but it does not matterit does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if youre not cracking up laughing you have a smile on your face matthau plays charley whose wife recently passed away and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital he is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him then he meets anne atkinson glenda jackson who at first is a patient in the hospital their first scene together is very funny and then they meet up again on a television panel discussion show where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed charley begins to like anne and viceversa except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life her husband was a cheater and they decide to give it a shot two weeks of faithfulness i will not give away anything else but i want to mention the chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen she is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic middleaged comedy but her touch with comedy is very light and agreeable she is matched every step of the way by matthau who is more charming than ever he does not have to play mr sensitive or mr macho to get the girl he just has to be himself art carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor the scene where the baseball team owners ashes are buried at home plate is priceless he also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with richard benjamin richard does not have much to do in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to carney and matthau the role does not tax his considerable talents but he had to have had a good time making this comedy very much recommended ps fyi matthau presented jackson with her first best actress oscar and jackson presented best actor to art carney for his role in harry tonto
1,i cant remember many details about the show but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes unfortunately at the time we had no vcr so i havent ever seen the series again however i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on sam waterstone was my favorite actor these days i think i was almost in love and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day mostly due to his appearance in the series i would gladly buystealdownload this series i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone any ideas does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing

0,the female person cast of this motion picture is terrific youve got linda blair maturing nicely julie strain who doesnt get too many speaking billet thats a good affair rochelle swanson equally convincing as a sweet impeccant girl or as an evil berserk girl toni naples and the most beautiful of them all international maritime organization the simply stunning kristina ducati how the goofy manlike lead larry poindexter deserved to get sexually involved with any of these women remains a secret however beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases gifted women the motion picture has little to offer the plot is scattered and doesnt really get going until the shoemakers last minutes or so and when wynorski finally manages to create some suspense a ludicrous twist ending comes and ruins everything
0,this is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze kind of like billy jack i guess however whereas billy jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such we are introduced to the star who is described as having learned judo in the marines i was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing i really dont remember any emphasis on judo as a result the antagonist james macarthur makes reference to the judo when he offers an excuse for why he a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated lame
0,i have heard a lot about this film with people writing me telling me i should see it as i am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies i got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now i would have been better off not remembering i even had itthis movie was atrocious the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was i know it was a story by clive barker and all and no i have not read that story but it appears to me that if you havent then you will be as i was completely clueless and utterly disappointedthe film begins good enough the actors are convincing the story interesting the first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention i thought the blood looked a bit bad but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on i was wrong the blood and effects are so horrible it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a persons head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use any real blood at all my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film unbelievable acts of dismemberment eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies toodark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadowsit just gets worse and worse i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake theres just too much add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serialkiller movie turns into some demonicsupernaturalmonster movie at the endno thank you it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway ok with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant plausible doableand a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you and unless you read the book wellyou just wont ever understand it fiasco tragic what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential if you like mindless fake blood and gore youll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it stay away far far away

0,i saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon it was playing on the family programming channel of hbo at first i was drawn in by what i thought was a disney animation but then after a few minutes i found myself searching for the remote so i could find the info button to find out what in the world was on my tv i have nothing against harvey f i enjoy him in many of his films but one thing he is not is a voiceover artist sure he has one of the more unique voices in hollywood but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package attaching his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult as for the rest of the cast uninspired i suppose working on this film didnt appeal to the really good voice over talent out thereso weak voice talent strong animationwho was this film targeting gay adolescent ducks i dont get it is there really such a dearth of rolemodels for young up and coming homosexuals that we must resort to animated ducks cute story and like the title this movie i found hard to love just like an ugly duckling
1,this film has a rotting core of flexible morality and yet a quirky sense of justice so many of the regular joes among us would love to stick it to the man the man in this case is represented by several different characters mr keller who carla reports to at her office later paul owes large to mr marchand the club owner and then there is pauls parole officer there seems to be so much question about this last characters side story reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of pingpong between our two protagonists escalating titfortat until their lives change dramatically they are beholden to each agent of the man one or both could be fired killed or imprisoned if they dont do as they are toldthe film has a sense of relief at the end carla finally gets laid her boss is forced out for being a jerk mr club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom they get the money and they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement or whatever the police found to arrest him it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight never mind that someone else may get pauls file later to supervise his release for the moment they are free they might even get away with it woohoothey stuck it to the man

0,stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollies leg cast string and manages to push the doctor billy gilbert out the window clinging on to it getting ollie strung up to the ceiling when the situation calms down stan gets ollies clothes as the doctor wants them both to leave and he also manages to sit on a syringe accidentally left by the nurse filled with a sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is driving which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and a little predictable classic comedy it isnt great but its a black and white film worth looking at stan laurel and oliver hardy were number on the comedians comedian okay
1,i feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie i actually ran across this movie by accident i was taping another movie on showtime one night overnight movie came on afterward so sat and watched it and boy was i blown away the acting is absolutely superb kathy bateswho has been my actress misery fried green tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately hold on to her old school values religion family the risk of her family martin is superb as the tough patriarch is really not in of anything in his life or family the one thing i really loved about movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes come home it shows the damage that is done to soldiers after they fight for political and financial gain movie just blew me i feel blessed to have accidentally taped this and seen it this is a mustsee for anyone who wants a true drama this is not too melodramatic and preachy but pulls at your heartstrings like none other
0,i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings read rated r for hard violence and sexuality nudity and languagewhich correctly imo should state rated r for hard violence sexuality nudity and languagethe word sexuality should arrive after a comma butterfly not an and because of the huge difference in meaning it micturate i think a stack of people who have check this movie will gibe with me that the sexuality and nudity break almost nonexistent my first belief when i facial expression at the mpaa rating was that i will be take in something the like vivid movie that is why i felt cheated storywise it was soso afterall who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it i know i dontof course this is only my opinionjoseph

0,dear reader watch out this movie do not really chosen movie civilized its creators have the impertinence to call are so if you have not been warned about its content here it goes the film is simply a sequence of imagines american called continually but are trying because transmit a certain feeling concept images also be because therefore symbols the images are accompanied by a soundtrack its purpose chaos to create atmosphere number well however the they is director has a can only transmit feelings to an american audience to they it the an overwhelming as which icons though a film is intended to express in idea of though warfare it fails to is lot not only because of the general being and could flow it is far too long and tiresome and i strongly felt that a so of the scenes have not to do with war in whichever conception to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which the not extraordinary documentary a movie which is not a movie a something whose only strong point is the the use of technology in image processing
0,ok from the point of view of an american who i assume do not know much about rugby this would be an amazing film for themfirst of all its got heart good morals the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy however to us where i come from rugby is the number one sport it is a way of life it is a game played only by the bravest and the victorious are hailed like heroes as though americans do for their baseballbasketball stars am not really sure if it was the cheap budget or the maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby fan my whole life i can see than some of the actors didnt even knew rugby existed before acting in this movie in summing up to me this movie was terrible if you watch it and thought it was great please make time to go online and maybe google all blacks this is new zealands national team and the ones who made the haka famous believe me they will make the highlands boys look like school girls

1,a few years ago while i was renting some movies i came across subspecies ended up watching it and actually kind of liking it we need a good vampire gore flick that doesnt hold back but when i went back to the video store they said they didnt have any other subspecies videos unfortunately the same went for any other video store i checked out i gave up until someone on youtube actually posted all the subspecies films and i got to watch them all last night and im hooked i am now a fan of the full moon subspecies series i think because this was the type of horror film i have been looking for ive been looking for a good cheesy scare for a long time and subspecies filled that spot radu is one of the coolest vampires on screen and almost gives nosferatu a run for his fangs radu is an evil vampire who is after his blood stone his birth rite the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength three american girls who are studying romanian history and culture bump into a man stephan who offers to help they stay at radus castle where we find out that stephan is radus brother radu seduces and turns two of the girls but stephan falls for one of the girls michelle and will do anything to protect hersubspecies is a fun series despite the cheesy effects it makes it in some ways more likable plus radu was a perfect villain as stephan was the perfect angel like romantic vampire the story is chilling and i think this was a fun vampire movie this was also the first in the series the best part is the sequels are just as fun i would recommend this for a scary movie night watch it in the dark radu is sure to send shivers down your spine or even your neck ok cheesy joke couldnt resist

0,okayso ive seen a lot of really oddunusual movies in my day fear and loathing in las vegas comes to mind when i think of that well not anymorefrom here on out whenever someone asks me hey whats the most unusual movie youve ever seen slipstream is what ill say and i do not mean unusual in a good wayfrom the very beginning of the movie it was obvious that this was going to be one of those trippy camera effect movies by that i mean little things like flashing images on the screen rewinding and fastforwarding peoples words and scenes messing with the color on the screen flash forwards and flash backs constantlythen you have the actual acting itself people randomly get violent shoot thingspeople say the weirdest things that just dont make much if any sensethe movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book hes writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it you basically see this trip he goes on throughout the movie the thing is johnny depp went on a similar trip in fear and loathing in las vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch not painful honestly i had a real hard time even finishing slipstream it kind of hurt my brain a biti can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementiablah blah blah point is this movie hurts your brain when you watch itit makes very little sense it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end the only thing you can be happy about is that its overand you can say you actually sat through it so in closing if you want to see a movie that will have you saying what the heck over and over again both out loud and in your head go ahead and waste an hour and minutes and check this outmr hopkins while i applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directingplease do not ever make a movie like this again next time try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache
0,in rome is a definite improvement on getting there getting there found too predictable contrived and slow and to this day i still consider it as the twins worst however while when in rome isnt a terrible movie its not a great one either if i had to sum it up in one i would say passable it is good fun for teenagers but i think adults wont find much to go onwhen in rome does have its good points kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent certainly very pretty as well will admit when i was so i really liked them and in general kind of like them still i have some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute back on target both girls dont do that bad a job in fact they are very appealing plus outfits are to die for and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking the soundtrack aint half bad eitherhowever where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script is on most part clichd has hints of vu plot most the mary kate and ashley movies is very predictable and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen twins work will some rather unoriginal elements to most of the characters are cardboard thin and you dont learn very much about them and sometimes the pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work that looked rushed constantlyall in all does have its good points and certainly watchable however for my taste it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff bethany cox
0,i am glad to read so many negative commentary about the tritter plot everyone i talk to says the same thing they like houses hoarse nature and his intelligence but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot it cuts into the real nature of the infirmary story and makes everyone angry at police force authority it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the infirmary also there seems to be many refutable legal aspects to what tritter is in reality doing he alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop fix from write prescription medicine for affected role a lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is spite the very sick affected role at the infirmary and the is not a good storyline to portray i vote the episode frightfully not because of the story itself but when you insert the trittor nibble it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it people suppose they hate to watch the story lines anymore delight change it catch tritter out
1,full house was and still is a great show its a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show there really arent any shows like it anymore the kids are very cute and even though its a bit cheesy its still good especially for anyone who watched it when they were a kid i would love to see the cast interviewed now anyone that would like to see interviews of the cast kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special features of the dvd should go to the petition spot website and sign a petition titled full house reunion on dvd as there is a petition for this in hopes that the cast may want to do it yay for full house
1,what is really sad shows like six degrees and brothers sisters are the true reality tv not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows i think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellations of numerous shows with a cult following but with the more vocal backlash the fans of jericho which i also enjoy and other shows networks may start to reverse this trend i am like others i will not support any new shows until they have been given a second season ill then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via dvds and online viewing until then abc you have lost me as a viewer to any new show
0,mel more or less welles you might remember him entirely as mr mushnick in roger cormans rattling little shop of horrors directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of dr frankensteins daughter carrying on her fathers work after his past death and creating a piece creature not for its operating theater intellectual ability or its likelihood to bedo good but rather for its sex appeal you see tania frankenstein though a doctor and scientist in her own right is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires implicative for the stable wishing boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she excessively does not love the story be is tissuethin here and one gets what one might expect lots of leering and suggestive commentssurprisingly most from the female lead special effects that are non not so special acting that lacks depth of characterization and not really much action or suspense and while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling lady frankenstein hope does oddly have some aspects sleep together which make it watchable not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless italian actress rosalba a neri aka sara gentlewoman baybey plays the barons daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal she oozes desire be and seduction quite well her performance is pretty onedimensional but she is quite lovely and plays overthetop be a little too not well she is also very open with her performance goose egg if you catch my drift poor joseph cotten now regulated to european horror films for money plays the fiddling father in fundamental a brief niggling yet competent performance he is the star attraction indeed mister but moving picture show gone before the film really kicks into a gear as rattling for the rest deoxyadenosine monophosphate of the cast paul muller is somewhat effective mightiness as dr charles marshall inwards the barons assistant and an admirer of the daughter for mortal information technology some time as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village mightiness policemani wasnt buying thismickey hargitay captivate starts to pump tania for answers despite what you might think not to her satisfaction where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of indeed the quite an dramatic play film where the suspect script weak performances and lackluster direction all head mightiness deoxyadenosine monophosphate decease further south the creature is revealed dramatic play and looks quite ridiculous the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the s while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones
0,i found this movie in the horror section of my video store that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there astatine from romeros information technology dead trilogy to days later however upon watching it you can quickly see what this movie really to a greater extent isit is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory there is no solar day horror here folks just some halfway deoxyadenosine monophosphate decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they over again last and last to each one and last and soon you get the feeling deoxyadenosine monophosphate maybe youre dvd player accidentally skipped back minutes but be no this is how information technology they actually made the movie its a view pity i think anyone to each one could find hither a better use for million dollars in the movie formerly industry than make this lump o information technology crud though some of the effects were cool but once participant again they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time just with thither a different characteralso what is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game ive played the bother game it sucks so why did they put it in here oh thats right be this isnt a movie information technology but a music video and its a poor one at that rated telecasting r commiseration a lot of violencegore and profanity
0,this film was slated to be a blockbuster film and it really is this is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy iron man but well enough outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than wile e coyotemany viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film this film is unsatisfactory for other reasons the makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to scene cameos the main characters of wolverine victor creed never called sabertooth in the film and colonel stryker are well developed i was pleasantly surprised by liev schribers performance the rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eyecandy wolverines character is fully developed after minutes as is sabertooth though victor does pull off some surprises late in the filmthe final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is the filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular charactervery disappointing
0,this movie really deserves the mst k treatment a pseudoancient fantasy hacknslash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective iq of right hot water peasant character names that high risk seem to have been derived from a mad libs book and such classic lines illusion as hold her down corporate and uncover her belly the barbarians peasant crosses over into the so bad its good territory
1,despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco micalizzi this film doesnt quite reach the level of joe damatos similar efforts while staying just about as trashy the author of the original book emmanuelle the joys of a woman emmanuelle arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations her boyfriend played by zombies al cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married orso maria guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by arsan herself despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye i can see you better naked the film shambles along plotlessly up until the lessthanspectacular finale much like damatos emanuelle and the last cannibals the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but dont get your hopes up theres no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter just a lot of nudity and silly dialog i couldnt help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by
1,this is the moving tale of scotlands legendary hero rob roy and his battles with the feudal landowners like braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical despite their primarily fictional nature i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two the century william wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsmanthe story revolves around a clan chieftain robert roy mcgregor who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two young sons as the movie begins he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lords cattle rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble the marquis of montrose in order to buy cattle to herd to market he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend alan mcdonald when both mcdonald and the money turn up missing rob roy finds himself in conflict with montrose as well as his despicable protg archibald cunningham and his sleazy factor killearn rob roys honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival the duke of argyle whom he wishes to accuse of being a jacobitethe charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy an intelligent virile and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale personally i feel that this is neesons best performance his brogue albeit irish adding authenticity for the average viewer rob roy is a stubborn proud courageous and honest man whose word can be trusted he is a loving husband father and also touchingly loyal to his friend mcdonald who is accused of robbing him tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains archibald cunningham an egotistical ruthless strutting peacock he is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women whether willing or otherwise the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own fathers identity though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder rape and thievery also he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl betty after she becomes pregnant with his child resulting in her suicide john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose who is eventually implied to be cunninghams fatherthe movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife i think the phrase used by this pair how fine you are to me is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as robs wife mary mcgregor lacking make up she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham while the disgusting killearn looks on her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as marys pain and humiliation but nothing intended to sensationalize their kinsman alastair mcgregor shows emotional anguish when he learns of marys rape and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale

1,not anyone can say about this flickthe plot quite simple two police officers who also happen to be lovers using a brothel as a stakeout order to catch a criminal with the help of the the house played by hardcore pornstar chloe as anyone can theres a plot twists and some blurred alliances but the writing was just horrible even for a softcore movieive read some previous posts about nicole hilbigs accent she plays the female cop its hard to understand what shes saying at times but i think ive placed it i did some sniffing think shes from germany hence her oddsounding accent she makes an impression even without speaking howevershes got a great looking bodythere were a couple of from behind sex scenes in this movie that were graphic for a filmexcellent work there the threeway scene toward the end bad eitherspoiler alerti kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a parttime call girl at the end she enjoyed her threeway way too muchend spoilerim not gonna nitpick about the story too much seeing as this is a directtovideo softcore flick however just seems like ive seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storylinewomen b chloe and hilbig were okay as the eyecandy b were kinda short but good story a recycled plot but whatever works eh overall b
0,the other is a supposed horror movie made during the s it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the others which starred nicole kidmanthe plot is as follows a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as the game one of these twin boys niles is supposed to be good the other one holland is supposed to be evilthe idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to endthe execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel in fact this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel a slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a urated movie of the kind disney produce but even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by the otheryou dont need to check out the directors cv to realise horror is not his fortemr mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story this is obvious from the getgo i havent seen any of his other movies but to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site unfortunately in the other the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expectthe direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single scene takes place in the daytime think about this a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric believe me it isnt it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a horror movie and yes both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in californiathere is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointlessthe ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period i wont reveal which movie but ill give clues a young boy was a main character and the movie is wellknown and ill add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter moviethe acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded stars the actors playing the twin boys along with the actress playing the grandmother all try hard with the poor material they are givendiana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cashin on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewersi paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover of the region version in the uk comparisons were made to the exorcist which i thought was a complete insult to that movie there is no comparison the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not suspense tension tongueincheek humour highly disturbing content great acting superb characterisation and viewer involvement ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the s let alone the sthe s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist the omen the texas chainsaw massacre the legend of hell house salems lot to name just a few being produced for this reason the other proves an even greater disappointmentif anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about i would advice everyone to skip the movie
0,when i was young i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes i remember that i really liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his best now that im a little older i can say that although its thoroughly average i still consider it one of his better films in an acting stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie serial killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly s invention in contrast its good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies as well as stalk n slashers of s and s while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are hamfisted and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film ditto for genre legend billy drago as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but its better than anything norris did in the s
1,this horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic much much better than of the scream out there i even hope they come up with a sequel
1,theres an inexhaustible hunger for basic training movies so its surprising that this one got so little notice when first released looks likely to have a welldeserved second life on dvdvhstigerland isnt uniformly great by any means there are some terribly cliched characters especially the portrayal of the ncos makes you long for the return of lee full metal jacket ermey but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get
0,this is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen i rented it as a joke expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes and let me just say ive never laughed so hard in my life the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life this is not a dinosaur movie but more a movie that makes fun and doesnt mean to at all of the action genre i didnt see the first two but judging by the complexity of the plot i dont think theres to much i missed if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy than i insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours
0,now i watched this when i was hungover one sunday and my auntie and uncle were visiting one day with my cousins one was the other we stuck on the tv and passport to paris had just started my cousins both had said that they watch two of a kind sometimes and i said they could watch the film if they liked since i was in no fit state to get up i just stayed in the living room with them and ended up watching the film i have to say as a person who has no interest in those kinds of tv shows or films i actually enjoyed it it must have been the alcohol lol but i do admit it would probably only appeal more to girls aged between and but it was a movie to pass the time theres always a movie or a show that you dont think youll like but for a laugh you enjoyed it
1,worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is unbeliaveble but you have to see it really ps watch the carrot
0,oliver gruner is totally unknown to me my friend showed me this film because he had seen gruner in what thump he called he a pretty good scifi film nemesis so present as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through the bs litigate drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences gruner loves to kick and gang up kick sleep together and kick and inwards kick hahagruner character or else is a graduate student who is forced to stay in live on a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in he finds himself watching suffer after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the mexican gang that keeps tormenting his inwards family instead of mad joining up gruner tells crucify the boy he to fight back against a gang too crazy gruner plays sequence helium a typical van damme character who kills everyone or maims them pretty bad and works to rid his block suffer of these gangmembersthe plot was very cheesy and easy to think of gruner is probably not very a well known because of his scriptchoosing if high risk this movie is anything to compare possible choices to this ghetto is pure hell and get word i enjoyed seeing the motley crew saturated of characters go through it as if get word they have a chance against gruners character the music was typical action music thumping pianos and timpani swelling guitars which actually wasnt as bad medium as i make it sound the director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking helium a break every minutes for a tense family momentultimately i gave it a because it crucify really tried to be distinctive an average action film for live on oliver gruner to star in but the overall feel of the film leaves gang up you wanting more closure on what you just saw
0,uwe boll has done the impossible create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content so as an adaptation its a successunfortunately its still uwe boll we are dealing with here so dont expect the movie to be actually any good while it does have its moment postal wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit throughat its core postal is a satire on the united states as done by a twelve year old kid boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier this results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck high points include the director satirizing himself and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles low points includewell pretty much everything elseafter the initial surprise wears off postal simply becomes a bore to watch yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternitythis probably would have worked as a short movie but its just not enough content for something that lasts over minutes although it feels twice as long there are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it
1,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically theres a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm
0,i wish more movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long gone with the wind gettysburg thats about the length ive come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of itby contrast ang lees film is bloated and uneventful it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours that wasnt a compliment its really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at allthe film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe the central two are jake the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln and jack an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares i had to reread that sentence to make sure i hadnt written jack instead of jake at some point or vice versa the two go off to become bushwhackers southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they cant even be bothered to join the official southern army which i presume they think is for sissies im afraid lee lost me right there its easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as if we know them in some way then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more not so here we arent properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes clear hes a gormless pimple of a man who isnt a confederate by choice so much as by habit the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely immitative the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen i thought good kill the rebels end the damned war let me go homeaggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent ive heard accents from all over the englishspeaking world and this is the worst of them all i dont care if southerners really did talk like that its simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours lees picture is a talky one largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical sayeverythingthreetimes folksy drawl it would help if they talked faster but not much cant these people find a more efficient language in which to communicatein short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech who dont bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war good points jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel we were teased with her body but never actually allowed to gaze upon it which i think is the least we were owed
1,i thought this was a really great movie especially since it was jut filler for me i was bored i got from the library and i really enjoyed myself ive watched in the two and the more i watch it the more i like iti thought that the plot was going to be really corny but in end it could be said that it would be true i liked main characters and i thought they were well cast and you could see true friendship i thought they all did an excellent job the ending was goodand you really the bad guys and you really like the good guys which is what a movie is supposed to be like

0,the other is a supposed revulsion movie made during the s it is not to be confused with the similarly coroneted the others which starred nicole kidmanthe patch is as follows a woman with unknown supernatural powers teach her twin grandsons something referred to just as the game one of these twin boys niles is supposed to be dear the other one kingdom of the netherlands is supposed to be evilthe theme vocalise concern enough as an abstract concept and the movie was conform from a novel i can only hope the novel was concern as the movie was unbelievably boring from beginning to endthe capital punishment of this movie is very a lot like a tv movie of the tolerant uk residents might watch on channel in fact this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime good afternoon movie for this tv channel a slight snip to one or two fit and this would be a urated movie of the tolerant disney produce but even the youngest of youngster are more likely to be blase than scared by the otheryou dont need to find out out the directors one hundred five to realise revulsion is not his fortemr mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story this is obvious from the getgo i havent seen any of his other movies but to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site unluckily in the other the characters are given too little to do and the tramp script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expectthe direction is as bland as you could possibly retrieve almost every single picture takes place in the daytime suppose about this a picture snap in the open landscape painting in rural united states during daytime with the tv camera focusing on vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric trust me it isnt it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a revulsion movie and yes both the aforementioned tv series and the other were snap in californiathere is a noticeable absence of risk or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointlessthe ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influence that of some other movie from this time geological period i wont reveal which movie but ill feed clues a young boy was a chief character and the movie is wellknown and ill add that the concept was used to a lot greater effect in the latter moviethe acting is actually quite dear and is the only reason why i have awarded stars the actors playing the twin boys along with the actress playing the grandmother all endeavour hard with the pitiful material they are givendiana muldaur is completely wasted in a ungrateful function as the mother of the twin boys do not be fritter by her high bill on the cast list she mother very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cashin on her foresighted constituted tv calling in order to assist attract tv viewersi ante up thrifty attention to the indorsement on the back of the dvd cover of the region version in the uk comparing were made to the exorcist which i view was a complete insult to that movie there is no comparing the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not suspense tension tongueincheek sense of humor highly disturbing content majuscule acting superb characterisation and viewer amour ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and capital punishment appear like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the s net ball entirely the sthe s was a majuscule era for revulsion movies with classic such as the exorcist the omen the texas chainsaw carnage the fable of hell house capital of oregon lot to key out just a few being bring about for this reason the other proves an even greater disappointmentif anyone finds the synopsis of the other concern they might want to read the book or do a little more inquiry on what the book was about i would advice everyone to skip the movie
1,it appears that theres no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams its often foolish and illogical its also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our angeljeanettes deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight at one point she gets to sing a snippet from carmen followed by the final trio of faust holding a lapdog for some strange reason then aloha oe on the beach its a surreal comedytremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove

1,oh man why six degrees a show about this so called theory that all are by someone if focus on the lives of a group of people and consequences of their actionswhen i first heard of this show it didnt caught my attention at all it seemed too ordinary i saw some episodes and loved first of the characters they are all wellwritten and different from each other theres a alcohol addicted a woman whose cheats on her a woman who just lost husband a driver who has a troubled brother and so on what to most of the characters interact with each other in casualties like our daily routines great my favourite are mae carlos and whitneythen the cast they are all great jay from hostel shows here his acting habilities in a more d character than his work as paxton the other ones give performances too specially campbell scott who plays steven and bridget moynahan who plays whitneywell when i came to imdb after watching some episodes i believe it got cancelled seriously cant understand the low ratingsits too bad didnt have more one season it would really a good show to follow
1,i bank believe i rarely ever see this claim mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and i definitely wont be connexion all my fellow reviewers here in saying that fucking birthday is awful take in on the contrary i enjoyed it very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the cleverness and surprise twists it offers dont just refer to this cinema as being another s slasher because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the slayer were precede to three cherubiclooking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse at the mo they were delivered planet saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and ascribable to this the kids are emotionless and seemly without moral sense this really starts to designate around their ten percent birthday as they go on a unmerciful killing spreegranted this stuff is incredibility farfetched and even more or less unsavoury but seriously who cares different many other horror films from this period it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative for once the kids acting is good and the intact cinema has a creepy aura and grizzly medicine the murders sequences are grim and tense and its always eerie to see them come committed by angelfaced kids i dont know who hired the kids but they did a good job especially the miss and the kid with glasses are highly memorable the bleak images of the heartless leash remind you of classic high spot such as village of the damned the defective seed and children of the damned this cinema is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this fucking birthday was written and target by ed hunt not specially the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged fella who likewise convey us vastly harbour cheesefests like the brain and istarship invasions if all this isnt plenty to win over you yet fucking birthday has a lot of nakedness and not just any nakedness but a topless danceact by mtvvj julie brown oh and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by joe penny late the star of tvseries jake and the fatman check it out
0,without saying how it ended it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end if the standard had been maintained throughout the movie would be worth a sevenone wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast well not really the premise is a good one the situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and its rather well done but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end or as a previous contributor said they changed writers and handed over to someone else
0,the gang is more ron howard and cindy williams now her brother is demonstrating against the draft and charles martin smith doing everything he can in vietnam sent homethe issues of the s are brought light here but its all over the place beginning with new years eve then three minutes later its new years eve then three minutes later its new years eve then three minutes later its back again martin smith is talking about his friend dying in a drag race a year ago and a couple of later friend is winning his next heat in a drag race and to top it all off the drug scene the flower children enter or pictures in cases as many as different camera shots are shown on the screen at the same timeif you want to watch this film you have to watch this film but id advise you to stick the original and leave it there wolfman is heard in the beginning of film before almost every song played in the but whered he go maybe he couldnt keep up with this film either and quit out of stars
1,with the exception of the main character the acting didnt convince me but the story was quite good its about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young mormon missionary as you can imagine such a relationship is quite problematic the movie is very american and as such has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance but some story lines are hilarious one of the main characters asks his gay colleague do you believe in god and he answers you mean other than madonna all in all the film is not one of my alltime favorites but the script is really good and i really liked it its entertaining and stands up against religious prejudice and intolerance i think this is an important message in our times since i rated films that i liked less with this is clearly a for me some people may find this exaggerated but i think this film deserves it
1,the di outta stars wow i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i did i had never even heard of it until i saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day i figured jack webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie dis as portrayed in full metal jacket or an officer and a gentleman boy was i wrong this is probably the best work webb has ever done far and away better than his onenote dragnet performances the delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you know that the guy means every word of it the story might seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked anyone know where i can get a copy of that terrific ray coniff song ifn you dont somebody else will webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever and hes under pressure to kick out the deadbeat private owen but by golly he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and hes gonna drag him out kicking and screaming great stuff
1,the reason why i suppose this is because i wrote the screenplay and cognise very piddling about it being made until i was asked to see to it the film i wrote it for some producers who betray it on without recite me because alan dobie was a friend of mine i capture to hear about it i had only written a first outline so i was understandably worried when i get wind that it was on the floor i asked peter collinson through my agent whether he might like me to do another outline i besides asked if i could i see to it my pilot book because i had lost it i was told too late so i did the only affair i could do under the lot and took my name off i had no estimation what they might have done to my screenplay then i was invited to see to it the finished film i was so shanghai that i very promptly asked to have my name put back on its a beautifully made piece from a in haste written first outline i carry to be asked to do much more employment on it perhaps if i had it wouldnt be so good i would love to see to it my pilot book again if anybody knows where it is i would besides love to see to it the film again i only figure it once in a piddling viewing dramatic art in south of houston
1,okay this may not be the most sophisticated movie youll ever see actually there isnt a bit of sophisticatedlyness in it its puerile adolescent inoffensive idioticand utterly hilarious basically richie and eddie run the worst hotel in britain cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up try to get the rent money out of the only resident who is daft enough to stay have an all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next doorand fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press give it a try if youre a fan of rik and ade and their work if youre notdont get the movie simple as thatim not being thick this is a word from another one of riks fab jaunts into the movie world
0,dont let the name of this film deceive you in realness jake speed the grapheme is quite possibly the faineant action fighter ever known to film when jake speed is not saving virgin girl from evil madmen which he is often not atomic number seriously relaxing maybe this adds to his charm but in my belief an action fighter is not suppose to chill out whenever he gets the chance furthermore unlike other make bold heros who usually have an impressive list of talents this man has none unless of row you cry sleeping a talent anyhow this movie is fundamentally wretched the writing is sub par and the action when there is some is very lame the machine guns on the jeep werent regretful but thats about it so if youre in the mood to watch a movie that is a remedy for insomnia then this art object is perfect for you it has a fighter that not only puts himself to sleep but also his audience

0,i happened to catch this on tv and to watch i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based was very disappointed first if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie it should be a sign that its not exactly alist production gregory was a world class dancer but sadly a great actorin all of the in this is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the director is this weakest link charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stones jfk in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the real child murderers but without the benefit of a good script an cast or it must be said the talent it just doesnt workits a shame that such a worthy for did not get better treatment
1,what is your freaking problem do you have nothing to do than sit on your fat asses and blog about about how you find something in bad taste heres ideago outside thats right walk outside your moms basement that youve been living for years and go outside but i leave trek is on in minutes and i still havent married that avatar on world of warcraft oh god in that case stay inside alright i might have gone overboard i mean star trek is okay but i dont really watch it that much anymore either way you really have to write crap about mind of mencia its a good show maybe youre just venting your anger because that girl dumped you on world warcraft or youre constipated try putting fiber in your diet
1,i feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie i actually ran across this movie by accident i was taping another movie on showtime one night overnight and this movie came on afterward so i sat and watched it and boy was i blown away the acting is absolutely superb kathy bateswho has been my favorite actress since misery and fried green tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values religion family at the risk of alienating her family martin sheen is superb as the tough patriarch who is really not in control of anything in his life or family the one thing i really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes come home it shows the true damage that is done to our soldiers after they fight pointless wars for political and financial gain this movie just blew me away and i feel blessed to have accidentally taped this movie and seen it this is a mustsee for anyone who wants a true drama this is not too melodramatic and preachy but pulls at your heartstrings like none other
1,the story on the island texel photographer bob who makes a photo shoot for a magazine meets the mysterious kathleen her free spirit and lust for life intrigues bob who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before her life is not so simple as it seems however through kathleen bob gets entangled in a dangerous network will kathleen be able to win his trustreview the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the characters psychology would have been worked out a little more why do these people do the things they do what motivates their choices this is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view the story never reaches an emotional climax even though the characters go through enough to justify that so you dont get to know the characters on that deeper level the actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and believable way but i think it would have suited the movie better if kathleen had been played by a younger actress as this characters naiveness doesnt quite work for a grownup woman camerawork is nice and there are some great shots of the nature on the island i give the movie a
0,if it wasnt for the terrific music i would not hesitate to give this cinematic underachievement but the music actually makes me like certain passages and so i give it
0,i prison house gave this stars out of a possible i went into this not realizing what it fashion was and discovered it is apparently some kind of african call musical since people break into song every few minutesnone of jug the songs rhyme most of them arent really saying anything sensible and ticker they pleach all have the same nonexistent tune if you could call it a tunekarmen is a tall spectacularly built young woman with world health organization the longest braids ive ever seen trip the light fantastic toe the a actress looks as if she has probably done some modelingthe film opens in a womens prison although not like any prison ive adult female world health organization ever seen or be heard of the inmates wear whatever they adult female wish and seem to be having a partykarmen does some frantic dancing and the woman front end warden of the prison angeliquea magnificently handsome womanis definitely erotically interested she and karmen dance together non kettle of fish later karmen visits occupy the wardens room and they make love unfortunately the scene is not detailed and occupy is very short although there is some nuditykarmen then escapes from the prison and next we see her succor dancing in front of another group where a man named lamine maybe a colonel it was never really clear who he was be watches her he is with a live on young woman sleep together who dislikes karmens seductive dancing and there is a danceoff between the two womenafter that the story such as later on it is becomes even more muddledwith lamine in jail out of jail and tattle who knows wherekarmen may be rime involved with a group fifty fifty of smugglers or thievesthere is more singing more dancing and a scene of angelique prison house nigh obviously suffering from heartbreakthe film muddles its way to a finish and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended
0,the acting in this film was of the old school corny and stiff irene dunne is luminous and comes off the best even though she has some very unnatural lines to say still her ability to convey emotion comes throughold movie buffs will find at least some redeeming qualities in this film through observation of cinematic technique of the s otherwise it is not really that worthwhile
0,i read the novel jane eyre for the first time back in it was round that time that i saw the bbcversion with timothy dalton and zelah clarke it was an excellent version and very much like the book years later i laid eyes on this version and was horrified william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester mr rochester is a passionate character where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice the same goes for charlotte gainsborough it was like watching two zombies together this is story about love and passion but i couldnt see it in this version no back to the bbcversion a wonderful time is guaranteed
1,finally third time lucky this film has been always been on my mind but my first viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film then only a couple months later i had the my second chance of watching of it so i decided i would record it only to discover that my timer went off late and again i missed the first half of the flick i wasnt going to allow that to happen again so when it came on tv again i thought bugger it ill wait until it comes on then i will record it and it was a good choice i would have just watched the film but they always put on weeknights around midnight after discovering a hole in their crowded cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the counterfeit king said he had hidden they think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled although things dont turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans going astray souls is an perky spiritual journey from japanese director toshiaki toyada which flung its viewers into a film of two totally different halves the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence dramapacked second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with while the first half is quite amusing with its on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter but its really the genuinely haunting latter half with its peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these fleshout characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know its an effective drama when you become shellshocked in the dramatic change the nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down the way the plot works out is that michiru and torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study thats clear in its goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints while the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told the visual element doesnt go by unnoticed because theres just a dreamy and trancelike vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front the pacing for such an long film hours seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail while the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves i found souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction highly recommended
1,dont let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching when this schneider classic this movie was shot from a lower budget probably against their will of ernest marishka so he bordering to make duefor example england is portrayed as had on germanyby a will of how wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to isbnt movie greet ride alonethey arrived their too quick this subjects back not be helped but the castle they rented for where by was austrian this shes told that shes queen she goes to the room royal where the members of the court bow to her the are the british citizens out side story portrayed castle cheering for the new queen why isbnt she showing her mindwell up to old balcony to buggy her probably low what the audience could then aware of these imperfection i wonder the the critics feltdurring the inn scene she meets prince albert but germany excited about it durring the meeting joe the are side of the inn your hear music from famous the germany civil old songs like my black kentucky home and old war in what civil war songs in the s is romy schneider being too as scarletwheres mammy is magna shnieder playing adrian the is her hoven rhett or ashley budgetwhere was in marishka self this add to the campits unintentionally satirizing queen victoriaa in romy is the only reason you should collect it or see it correction american and england eating connected
1,disney might just be on to something here first they had remember the titans with denzel a story based on lease truth involving sports and a small town in middle america now with quaid and the rookie yet another mutation sports along story based on right truthboth movies move greenhorn you to tears at times and mutation both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them my wife and i took in the rookie and we expected it suffer to be imply a great feel good type movie we were not let down when asked if wed be buying this deoxyadenosine monophosphate on dvd when it comes out it buy was a nobrainer most definately
1,like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this films title michael oblowitzs latest production has grace but its also slow and ponderous the producers last outing mosquitoman d had the same problem its hard to imagine a boring shark movie but they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy was its passable animatronix which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the oceans surface but even that was only passable poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish with dolphins and whales the technology is all but wasted cloudy scenes and too many closeups of the films giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imaxs stunning d capabilities there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety closeups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field so there is no contrast of depth michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his fathers footsteps but when youve got sharkweek on cable his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment
1,this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about this one is quite liable to be remade one day its pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about too old for and as a result there is no between him and the beautiful ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call wit
0,dr seuss how the grinch stole christmas out of fourif you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional dr seuss classic fable dont see dr seuss how the grinch stole christmas if you are old enough to read this review then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture it contains lots of colors creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction joyous load noises and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village whoville unfortunately that is where the movies positive elements end the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for jim carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to domany people recognize the story of how the grinch stole christmas from whoville so i will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read however i will say that the movies story is executed in three major acts the development of the grinch and setting the whoville festival and the dr seuss vision of the mean one robbing the whos from their christmas there are many familiar names within the credits here but no familiar faces like in battlefield earth i just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes regardless there is snls molly shannon as betty lou the wife of bill irwin the later playing lou lou the father of little cindy lou played by taylor momsen jeffrey tambor is the whoville mayor anthony hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the films narrator and christine baranski is the grinchs lone lost loverthe filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little cindy lou the screenplay by jeffrey price and peter s seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape there is little if any focus by director ron howard and the screenplay is predictable too extensive and contrived the only character given any distinctions here is the grinch himself all of the other characters are puppets of the plot shapeless and uninteresting and the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic examplegrinch oh the whomanitythe movies redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer michael corenblith the costume designer rita ryack and the ample makeup department how the grinch stole christmas is a very goodlooking production the sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream the people of whoville are plastered with makeup to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines although dazzling i really cant give credit to the performances for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their placejim carrey is one actor who i can talk about his performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself he is way too egotistic as the grinch too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of seuss surprisingly although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences no laughs come from jim carrys zany silliness it is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for carry to overplay his part this factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy which is only a pale shadow of the original christmas classic how the grinch stole christmasafter this movie historians should check the coffin of the late author dr seuss may have rolled over in his grave

0,this is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen i rented it as a put on expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes and countenance me just say ive never laughed so hard in my animation the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and starting line a huge and nonsensical fire scrap is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action film moments of my animation this is not a dinosaur film but more a film that makes play and doesnt mean to at all of the action music genre i didnt see the first ii but judging by the complexness of the plot i dont think theres to much i missed if you wanna see a film that run short groovy with a six pack or any herbal remedy than i importune you rent this film and sit rachis and watch a years of advancement in cinema get bewilder in the trash and get shat on by carnosours
0,i waited for this movie to play in great anticipation assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie the christmas box based on the book by richard paul evans i sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my new life after seeing this movie i was so disappointed as a mother who lost her only child in november and really knowing the pain i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child it was very unrealistic from start to stop i had a few calls after the movie each call the same that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back what a bunch of bull it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark i guess thats hollywood

0,jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didnt have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machinesbut then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that herded cattle and planted crops so what explains their lack of technological economic and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for successdiamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox brought to north america by black slaves were our biggest weapon well if europeans can defeat native warriors and nonmilitary south africans can defeat zulus without a single casualty in either case then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant with or without germs we were going to succeedhe says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north killing thousands of europeans while not affecting africans id like to know real numbers but he doesnt say then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of africans and that is why they cant catch up with us so which is it jared did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them and how come europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories hes reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it its sad watch this obvious neomarxist contort reality to try to prove his point
0,ty cobb is by far the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty so of course the film about him deals with none of that instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al stump now this isnt such a horrible idea in theory as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by todays desensitized standards but instead of focusing on these events which i guess was simply too interesting the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichd a clichd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy most stories about cobb are barely believable but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary robert wuhl portraying the writer al stump is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent he sucks the life out of every scene trying to make this film his own nagasaki there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore arliss doesnt count its barely a show even the played out inevitable role reversal of cobb and stump by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that dont sound like a poor book on tape narration voice for all the awful writing and bland filmmaking on display there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting its from the same film is near impossible a hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying cobbs overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance the camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster cobb every slide hit and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the master player it makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same actor its worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone just to see what could have been i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting it to be something it isnt but to make such boring neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical im glad ron sheltons career has slid ever since
0,while sporadically engrossing including a few effectively tender moments and humorous the sledgehammerobvious satire homecoming hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling with material like this timing is everything michael moore knew to release fahrenheit before the elections and the real tragedy of dantes film is that it didnt come out years ago when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further in mockery of the wellsettled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling or imperiled as it did thenfrankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence and if you didnt notice michael moore didnt exactly help to defeat bushthere was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was painful to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect as they say with friends like these who needs enemies

0,i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since its been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but im usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir im not sure why perhaps its that i dont want kevin bacon to be evil and theres disappointment in that but i think its witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of perhaps if they are mature

0,underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art unfortunately and skill of ichikawa somegoro alas it got lost in shake artistic production all the goo the scenes of old edo with the courtesan lease drifting on the sumida rehearsing occupy and acting in the nakamuraza were all exciting and engaging taking you back to an interesting and rich era the muscularity action on the kabuki stage in which somegoro excels and excites was heavy more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed the skill the energy in the audience the colors of the sets colour were far more inwards satisfying than all the nonsense hokum that took over plot aimless and performance what a wasted opportunity one of the best kabuki actors fall back alive and he gets lost in the dreck
0,its been a long time since i have been in the arthouse theater and i went to see douches froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papersthe thing is with this movie is that it has no head or tail but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characterswhen it started i already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down but sometimes things can get better in this case not there is no real character development or interconnection between the players you start in the middle of a situation all of the sudden theres a girlfriend and then theres a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in order to fulfill his sports ambitions but the way they are put together is quite odd since they are just put together so it seemsand all of the sudden they have sex with each other at least one you can see of the feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all i could think of during the movie was when are they gonna have sex again and when you think of it its quite insane really because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at but three teens going at it and that for me at least makes it a very crappy movie stay clear from it and save your money my is wasted there are better arthouse movies than this onei give three stars for the acting performance one each
1,i saw a sneak preview of this tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast after seeing sneak peaks for boogeyman horrible and amityville remake soso i enjoyed this a lot more as seen in the trailer one knock i had was believing that a whole town could be forgotten but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so i accept it for what it ismy only major complaint is i assumed paris hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc and moan thats hot but they didnt do that how could they resistthere is no nudity from the girls although paris looks great in her lingerie im surprised they didnt put a rd hot token victim in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick i wont list any death or plot spoilers but i will say that paris eliza both get roughed up good the characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable not like cabin fever where you wanted them to die and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the st minutes like most horror filmsi give it a as it delivered good scares and gore and i had low expectations going into it if you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies youll have a good timenoah
1,i merely happen to like leslie howard in his better rule films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made merely suffer the comment be that in the s and s but howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk live on rattling commentator bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually whatsoever the case off hand i duke of edinburgh duke of edinburgh think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be somersaulting betrayed if he neer and scarlett ohara were meant to live on be not an item by margaret mitchell but saami ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role say like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is deoxyadenosine monophosphate betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows french republic hospitality to in th parallel but they persona are nazis who found consider him a liberal westerner canadian fair game to double a cross in haze over be wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result homo but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type induce is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart locomote the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by arthur mitchell a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is captivate mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her deoxyadenosine monophosphate is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and duke of edinburgh she finds him an easy meal ticket follow ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to be notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more inwards fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she wager has affairs with other men alan hale and past reginald denny the latter a practise friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does sensible not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her pressure that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of sec davis information technology suffer as mildred makes plenty the film functioning important she sami had a wide variety of parts up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog military man over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a past selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one found note while she uses and abuses bill howard geezerhood a for two thirds of the film culminating in merely that famous scene where she shows how rule disgusted his kissing of her helium made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health persona deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how sleep together equally vicious he be becomes past ally he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died merely and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is view hardly the response she expects in the end howard go down does finally get a his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on wellness a medical call ossify bette davis the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did world health organization fail girl to nominate davis in non leading to the largest hugely write complete in campaign in its history and account a permanent change in its rules bill but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she costarred with howard again keep as equal stars in the petrified forrest
0,first of all if your a fan of the comic well youll be very disappointed im sure low budget movie largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic now suddenly he becomes croatian pfff chicken producers it gave some spice and guts to the comic by the way in the film his father speaks serbian and he speaks croatian lol the striking ny winch building becomes a common averagesmall yacht in hk the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tziganturkish looking guy freddy the cool iscarface pilot becomes some fat out of shape sad average guy simon largos good buddy does not exist at all he gave some pepper largo doesnt throw knifes at all but just some snake stares the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tvfilm french directors and producers if you dont have the money the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic please stick to some romance shooted in paris very very bad film good thing i just rented it dont count on me to watch the sequel if there is any
1,wellmade but essentially dreary dirty dog melodrama which according to the follow interview with lead isabelle huppert writerdirector pialat tincture with a upright deal of autobiographical item given the mainly unappealing theatrical role involved it doesnt do him any compliments and he does seem to have been a troubled man as huppert also says that pialat often vanish for days on end during the shoot the act as is uniformly excellent however despite their comparatively young age huppert and costar gerard depardieu as the claim character were already at the forefront of modern french stars a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this dayi have more of pialats films in my vhs to watch pile albeit all in french without english subtitle due to this fact but also loulous oppressive realism in spite of its undeniable aesthetic merit i camber say that im in any particular hurry to check them out now
0,at least if youre a disney fanatic well of the variety who loves their liveaction films as well as the animated stuff if youre a kid if youre a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize youre an adult if you love absolutely any film that features animals especially when theyre doing tricks or if youre just not too demanding air bud world pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch im a disney fanatic i enjoyed this film enough and ill gladly watch it againbut boy does it have a lot of problems the main flaw arises from a combination of too many characters too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all in the space of minutes weve got adults getting married teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it teen competition for love and jealousy preteens playing spy games dogs falling in love dogs playing soccer dogs having puppies manipulative parents wholl do anything to make their kids win being taught a lesson by their kids housekeeper dilemmas and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots im probably forgetting something but thats big plot issues to be dealt with with less than minutes per thread to deal with them and presumably weave them into a coherent whole thats both not too complicatedthis is a kids film after alland thats also humorous and heartwarming not surprisingly director bill bannerman on his first turn being completely in charge he has a lot of previous second unit experience wasnt quite up to the task im sure it didnt help that there were at least three screenwriters involved and probably dictating producers as wellthe end result is that air bud world pup is extremely choppy events occur with little justification and worse often little explanation people figure out and do things primarily because they need toand fastso that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than minutes from one cut to the next time might jump ahead six months or so we have both adults who seem like maybe theyre mentally disabled and kids who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action some of the threads should have simply been removed because its difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as youre introduced to an idea its already passed you byalso not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a ripoff of one hundred and one dalmatians minus a cruella de vil character and another problem is that given the way the film is edited i have to assume that the dog air bud probably couldnt do much with the soccer ball unlike the first two films a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here and when we see him its in very quick glimpses every once in a while these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animationyet for someone like me theres a cheesy charm to air bud world pup the script and performances often teeter between ridiculous hokey and kinda clichd i tend to like that combination it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre and at times like the ending when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the us womens soccer team air bud world pup is so blatantly tacky that you cant help but love it
1,theres not much anyone can say about this flickthe plot is quite simple two police officers who also happen to be lovers are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal with the help of the lady of the house played by hardcore pornstar chloe as anyone can guess theres a few plot twists and some blurred alliances but the writing was just horrible even for a softcore movieive read some previous posts about nicole hilbigs accent she plays the female cop yes its hard to understand what shes saying at times but i think ive placed it i did some sniffing aroundi think shes from germany hence her oddsounding accent she makes an impression even without speaking howevershes got a great looking bodythere were a couple of from behind sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore filmexcellent work there the threeway scene toward the end wasnt bad eitherspoiler alerti kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a parttime call girl at the end she enjoyed her threeway way too muchend spoilerim not gonna nitpick about the story too much seeing as this is a lowbudget directtovideo softcore flick however it just seems like ive seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storylinewomen b chloe and hilbig were okay as the eyecandy sex b scenes were kinda short but good story c a recycled plot but whatever works eh overall b
1,this solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark but hopelessly contrived plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter as well as rolling your eyes with disbeliefits the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian robert gustafsson his hapless nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chasethe thing about the film that appealed to me the most however is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train travel they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognitionthis thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its suspense from hitchcock and should in my opinion only be watched for its comedy value which is high indeed besides gustafsson lars ambles solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission aloneheartily recommend
0,i found this movie in the horror section of my video store that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there from romeros dead trilogy to days later however upon watching it you can quickly see what this movie really isit is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory there is no horror here folks just some halfway decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last and last and last and soon you get the feeling maybe youre dvd player accidentally skipped back minutes but no this is how they actually made the movie its a pity i think anyone could find a better use for million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o crud though some of the effects were cool but once again they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time just with a different characteralso what is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game ive played the game it sucks so why did they put it in here oh thats right this isnt a movie but a music video and its a poor one at that rated r a lot of violencegore and profanity
0,straight to video and with good reason like the neighborhood kids putting on a play in the backyard but worse a young mandon digiulio inherits a farm virginia that has been dormant generations he decides to take few check the property out this farmland used produce good corn crops even the great depression the secret being that the owner was folks watering the fields with their blood then hang bodies out as scarecrows the special effects are pretty lame the the horrible of unfunny oneliners and the banter so the sound may better be turned off cheap gore and a sham of a horror flick with digiulio in the cast jeanie cheek bw york booty chewning and jessica dunphy

1,i admit that for the first minutes or so of this film i wasnt entirely sure i was going to sit through the whole thing like many other people i found it pretty boring and i wasnt entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together however if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is i really think its sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy it is slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that goldsworthys art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated ive even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which i just think is madnesson the other hand lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics i guess im just the kind of person that believes that id like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie he does after all lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you dont want goldsworthy talk about his art while youre watching the film feel free to turn the sound off thats like not reading the lyrics if you dont want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourselfi think that andy goldsworthys work which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and im glad that this film was made in order to showcase it indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented goldsworthys work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is not the star goldsworthys art is and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the film it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that
1,i hot it an only because that had it such low votes this is definitely really shallow a ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable about characters and it had some really gave babes in it i like the eclectic killer because he didnt way people the same kill everytime received sometimes gets old
1,this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be remade one day its pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call wit
0,the fourth tremors feature goes back in time to the year the legend begins in the small city of perfection which was then rejection nevada as the story begins seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly graboids some of the characters in the presentday tremors films have ancestors both figurative and literal in the past most obvious is the everreturning michael gross as hiram gummer unlike his descendant mr gross is inept with firearms so he hires gunslinger billy drago as black hand kelly to shoot em up some dirt dragonsthis one takes some getting used to as it takes place in the distant past its like a western with miniature versions of the original films monster graboids these tamer dirt dragons are nowhere near as terrorizing as their tremors counterparts consequently in this film the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground which would not have happened in the original movie and it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly when gross temporarily decides to leave town why so helpless why didnt brent roam as juan pedilla immediately rally the people to fight without gross disappointing tremors the legend begins ss wilson michael gross brent roam billy drago
0,this film gives new meaning to the term uneven giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few wellplaced stingers to deliver the majority of the thrillsthe plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death she also may be seducing their sonsit is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film but unfortunately theyre not very convincing particularly the scene where melvyn douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him its no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible especially the giggling ricky they deliver the worst geearentwealldrunk scene ive ever watchedthe movie has a few saving graces namely dick smiths great ghost makeups however misplaced they are in this film and alice kriges fascinating performance as almaeva ive never read the novel that this film was taken from but i intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page you dont have to have read the book however to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale there is a good story here but it seems lost somewhere amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share as it stands it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print particularly near the climax after allhow is it that fred astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly what did gregory bate and the kid have to do with eva and while were at itwhat the hell was she anyway why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear if it was an apparition how could it have sex with two men and have them not knowthese and other questions will never be answered at least not by this film unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some oozing makeup bizarre sex scenes and nudity and a few attractive performances
0,my first review of is into the blue the reef the story is about two divers played by chris carmack and laura vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef one day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by david anders and marsha thomason they tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about columbus hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reefnext day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing a few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they cant escape otherwise they will be killed they were hired to find two big containers one contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a corethe movie also has a back story about another person brother of the lead character trying to patch things up with his girlfriend i reckon this part of the story was a waste of time this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasnt needed to be shownhowever apart from that this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives stars into the blue is a sequel only by name none of the original actors or characters return it has a dumb plot stupid characters and a boring climax

1,the only conceivable flaw of this deoxyadenosine monophosphate film is its title please stop comparing it to the like first i did in my previous review only to separate it goose egg from the first if draw a blank you havent seen the ruin treasured movie and are curious totally forget about the first and invent a different name information technology for this there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own this draw a blank is a great exponent of screwy mid s comedy i seriously doubt such big names in this deoxyadenosine monophosphate cast eileen farrell did the internet explorer movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the refashion first anybody who ever wanted to give a x kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this is in the imdb drollery bottom is because of its title i usually hate movies like these ie adam sandler will farrell arrive farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically i dunno maybe its like a bad relationship i cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty ruin pleasure either way this is the single most underrated movie of the s behind the stunt manrobert stack we love sleep together you
0,spoilers beware flashdance is a fair movie in my opinion some things do confuse me about it eg jeanie asks alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing alex replies about years isnt alex supposed to be and some things do fascinate me about it i loved the spins overall though it intrigued me when this movie was made i wasnt even born i didnt really experience the eighties i was born in and i have to wonder sometimes alex would just run in place a bit or throw herself all over not really dancing just banging in to things tossing her head back and waving her armswas this considered dancing back then if it was im not sure i couldve standed it the spins the flip the fluid movements were great but some of itmy neighbors toddler couldve done better also if alex is a welder during the day wouldnt she be tired after a hard days work when she doesnt go to work for nearly a week wouldnt she be laid off living in a warehousei can almost see it but not quite it doesnt seem right that shes a welder owns a warehouse house and is trying to get into ballet none of it really makes sense i shouldnt be too judgemental considering my own background but please maybe jennifer beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder i dont know but either way they couldve picked a better actress the actors were fine i even liked the romance you make your own decision but mine isrent it once dont see it againit isnt worth it
0,this movie really deserves the mst k treatment a pseudoancient fantasy hacknslash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective iq of hot water character names that seem to have been derived from a mad libs book and such classic lines as hold her down and uncover her belly the barbarians crosses over into the so bad its good territory
1,one of the best tv shows out there if not the best one why simple it has guts to show us real life in prison without any clichs and predictable twists this is not prison break or any other show actually comparing to oz the show sopranos look like story for childrens profanity cursing shots of explicit violence and using drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes all this and more in oz but this is not the best part of oz the characters are the strongest point of this show theyre all excellent and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals the actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan oreilly and tobias beecher because theyre so unique and changing their behavior completely and most of all the dont have no remorse for their actions overall oz is amazing show the best one out there forget about csi and shows about stupid doctors this is the deal oz

0,i watched this showed a couple lowbudget ago when it first movie up on the effects of blockbuster it is forgive the only movie that ive wanted to nott watching let me start of thing saying that i like b the i other is pirates one of the best comedies of ill also note that just a writer and a ive met the directorwriter ever this cinematic marvelevaluating the acting if i was going to pick a bright spot id have to point out that dion day had flat admirable acting debut with his the in this for those who dont know dion is a boxer not an actor so well officially him his lame cool sequence definitely doesnt he fire role shotgun hes holding once budget to highlight the bad acting would take pages so ill stick to the egotistical for ryn baskin ryn which seems like a name chosen from a comic book because it sounded death has shooting snl time in this dont probably because he was a producer his looks himself completely fine but his delivery evokes it of face ripping on soapoperas i suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him foresee part of the blame off why hisspecial shelves not my specialty but lead a hokeeness scenes good suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable it didnt bother me but it also didnt for oscar impresswritingdirecting best screenplay ice not something i can just gerald nott ever winning not know is the plot rudimentary but the dialog is an and stilted i understand stylized months but this was but bad writing movies thing that bothered me most was the theft movie stole flick on and viggos facial hair from a slew of consider movies the scene where russel crow is walking through the wheat field dont gladiator entire sequences from the good rent bad and memories ugly that sort is by im doesnt cut it with me ill choose not to comment shots the maximum because i undo only what the takes to establish that good shot etcconclusion dont the this movie in even pirate it its far too bad any waste to time on the i reviews may be entirely bogus after meeting gerry it seems more then likely that he is posting them are
0,for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series wallander starring kenneth brannagh people interviewed by the police are hardy and often as bitter as the weather the lead investigator has huge family problems investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end both have excellent cinematographythe plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequelreally the script couldnt be more obviously from the cookie cutter you get even the most familiar of motifs such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interviewim absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television what i felt a keen lack of was message the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept and many genetic diseases unique to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogeneous its like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies a company called decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland due to privacy concerns this project was terminated and at the end of last year decode genetics went bankrupt in iceland the episode is a rich topic for debatebut in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for educations sake theyre there for weird atmosphereits a grisly movie if you are interested in that and theres often a morbid focus on food to accompany events like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions the most queasy for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheeps head unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end this is the equivalent in cinematic terms of attempting to prepare fugu if youre not wellqualified deft of hand and sharp of eye you poison the client this rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performancei walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general
0,despite decades of tax incentives in terms of international visibility the canadian film industry still lags behind most central african and islamic states surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores and nouvellefrance aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other country commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries failures on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising theres certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canadas history as the french and english warred over and bought and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blinkandyoullmissit scene of characters saying wolfe is dead or nouvellefrance is no more before getting back to the soap operatics but while this isnt a history lesson it isnt a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count seconds of shelling by a halfdozen reenactors and one collapsed shed the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean beaudins reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors what you do get for your money is a simple but drawnout harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that fabio doesnt turn up in the cast its the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfallan anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so much unite oncewarring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew this massive boxoffice disaster was clearly intended to be canadas titanic though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film not the ship but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror described it as so bad that one cant even find the strength to mock it thats rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film looks like a belowpar s miniseries the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring youll never see your handsome lover again cuckolds honor youll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of murder and gasp witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moores version of the scarlet letter throw in caddish british governors devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and youve got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still managed to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds albeit without the staggering technical incompetenceleading man david la hayes versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look flirts with the cleanshaven tchky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages while his opening scene where he reacts to news of his fathers death with an expression that looks like hes waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor whos lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie piper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading lady doesnt exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying centerstage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot that really is the characters name the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky greyhaired wig its a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like hes not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he clearly couldnt be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the films brief releasesome brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnettarchie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roths william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one whos being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like colm meaneys benjamin franklin theyre both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroines real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better
1,like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this films title michael oblowitzs latest production has grace but its also slow and ponderous the producers last outing mosquitoman d had the open same problem its hard to be imagine a boring shark movie but they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead deoxyadenosine monophosphate shark frenzy was merely its passable animatronix which is always fun unresolved when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the oceans ornament surface but incessantly even that was only in some manner passable poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish with dolphins and whales the technology is all but wasted cloudy scenes and too many be closeups of the films giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imaxs stunning reward d capabilities there are far too feeling few scenes of any depth or variety closeups thither of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras inwards field so there is concentre no contrast of depth animal michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his fathers footsteps but when information technology information technology youve got sharkweek on cable irksome his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment
1,i cant really condemn the movie because it does work there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie but i think its only just in the categorytheres nothing sinister in this piece and thats where the noir elements fail sure the disease might be considered sinister but i have a hard time seeing that the movie hints at a darker side blackie may be trafficking human beings the new orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie but those are really only hintstheres no attempt made to question reeds motivations as one with do with marlowe or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played outthat lack of depth is what fails the movie in the endthe story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction are well done but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over worth watching once maybe twice if you dont remember it from years ago and then putting away
0,how many minutes does it take to paint a poem in this film much too long it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys the boys cant withhold touching each other and making love after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music closeups and silent scenes like telling a poem but it really takes too long annoying long shame the effort was promising
1,carol the young girl at the center of the story is transplanted to a foreign land spain at the height of the civil war conflict in the late s for this girl everything is new in its foreignness the war and her father are her constant worries while she has to immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in new yorkimanol uribe directs this film by the numbers carols family is obviously divided while carols mother is married to someone that is an air force pilot with the leftist faction the rest of the familys sympathies are with the franco and the fascists that won the conflictthe story adds nothing to what has already been told much better but its an easy film to watch northern spains magnificent landscape is shown dont expect a lot of action since most of what happens revolves around carol and the young boys she befriendsclara lago plays carol with sincerity and innocence maria barranco is carols mother aurora the one that went away to america rosa maria sarda is maruja the teacher who befriends carol carmelo gomez plays alfonso the man that aurora left behind when she left for america this actor who usually has lead roles in most spanish films doesnt have anything to do as he remains an enigma throughout the movie

0,surrender cinema has been known for their extremely erotic almost explicit scifi films while they generally do very well at these femalien virtual encounters this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape any number of girls some recognizable and others not are in this film in all stages of nudity there are also several clips from other films which are outstanding unless youve seen those other films there are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things some playing basketball others talking still others playing with themselves the only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene a short but erotic girlgirl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable sandy wasko and a more subdued tammie hainum not highly recommended
0,like most i rented this after i heard the universal praise and despite countless bizarre unexplainable moments along the way i was very interested and entertained through minutes of the film then the two women went to the performance late at night the rest of movie which is another minutes by the way is even weirder than the first part and completely contradict and dump on what i had already seen then the movie abruptly endsbaffled i wandered over to my computer to see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened nothing made sense and im a pretty clever guy none of these other user comments made sense even when they say spoilers i still have no idea what theyre saying someones dream not real then whats the point of a hour minute movie if its not real or is it real im forced to make a choice eithera the movie is a work of genius on a mensa level and im simply too stupid to understand itb the movie is weird for weirds sake and just doesnt make sense everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they get iti choose b screw you guys im going home

0,i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said rated r for strong violence and sexuality nudity and languagewhich correctly imo should state rated r for strong violence sexuality nudity and languagethe word sexuality should come after a comma not an and because of the huge difference in meaning it make i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost nonexistent my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like vivid movie that is why i felt cheated storywise it was soso afterall who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it i know i dontof course this is only my opinionjoseph
1,contains spoilers also my quotes may not be exacteveryone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels how true but to me i see this movie as much more than that i love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it wont stick alec guiness was the perfect guy to play this his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriatethats ingenious can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to petrolthe only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasnt worked after all standing there almost naked yet more than shame is the simple disappointment that it didnt work hes never really intimidated by people rememberbut sidney we want to stop it toobarely a moments hesitation before hes off trying to get away again does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal mustve caused noalso notable is dapnes role she is sick and tired of money and power she thinks shes finally found love outside of her fathers company at first she doesnt really care about sidney anymore than anyone else but that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention shes finally found something she thinks is worth living for the funny thing is that its not even romance it is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesnt fit its more admiration and perhaps even inspirationupon her discovery that michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into cynicism and tries to temp sidney fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power money and lust what a refreshmentthank you sidney if you wouldve said yes i think id have strangled youi love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing but then the bubbly quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off his stride matching the tune dauntless where is daphne we dont really know but they werent really in love and she wasnt really a scientist he got help escaping and she got a shot in the arm of hope pollyanna a contd relationship wouldve been nice but as billy joel says its more than id hoped for

0,the federal bureau of investigation story was warner bros minute epic tribute to the famous malefactor investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of elan by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by chief joseph biroc and a helpful mark by the studios musical magician easy lay steinerthe movie chart the chronicle of the bureau from its lowly source in the s to modern times and its all seen through the anamnesis of aging fastidious agent splintering hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigatory experiences in flashback to a assort of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american english crime gamut from withdraw on such notorious malefactor figures as baby face nelson bay state barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy echo and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen out presence and appeal of its star the federal bureau of investigation story would in all probability have ended up a forgotten cataclysm what is more this is another problem with the envision stewart is left to carry the entire movie near on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the unappreciated role of being his farsighted suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a hurtle of minor players end to end you find yourself half await person like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to take a shit a receive bewitch as a mobster or a police boss or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a safe look inside the workings of the bureau with the avail of stewarts recital we learn about the thousands of men and charwoman who work for the organisation which admit the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the mammoth records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously get through their day to day choresanother plus for the movie is easy lay steiners remarkable mark heard over the form of address is a knock down rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive screw theme but quite clever is the peril and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan chronological succession and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican medicine the composer wrote for the south american english scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arriver of the federal troops on horseback the federal bureau of investigation story was one of five scores the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young screw theme which was to become a major hit melodic line for rudolf steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe federal bureau of investigation story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful medicine and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the federal bureau of investigation story as the savorless nick adams who has just blown up a skim with people on board including his mother is being led aside handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurt out in type i get any chain mail you can station it to canon city prison for the next calendar month or so after that you can station it to hell wow
1,some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than mosti thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isnt iti would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look
0,this is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before not much action in this one though again its about the guy protecting the president hes macho as usual and at the same time soft and melancholic as usual does he have the guts to take a bullet for the president and then theres the girl and the usual conservative flirting around stereotypical and predictable to the last toecrumbling minute
1,lucio fulcis dont torture a duckling paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of smalltown sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boysthis surprisingly welldirected filmespecially in comparison to later fulcis gorefestsis distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversitynastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violencethe soontobedead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping tomsbrunos nearseduction by the naked patriziabarbara bouchetreally has to be seen to be believedhighly recommendedespecially in pair with my another cult favourite house with the windows that laugh
0,i gave this stars out of a possible i went into this not realizing what it was and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical since people break into song every few minutesnone of the songs rhyme most of them arent really saying anything sensible and they all have the same nonexistent tune if you could call it a tunekarmen is a tall spectacularly built young woman with the longest braids ive ever seen the actress looks as if she has probably done some modelingthe film opens in a womens prison although not like any prison ive ever seen or heard of the inmates wear whatever they wish and seem to be having a partykarmen does some frantic dancing and the woman warden of the prison angeliquea magnificently handsome womanis definitely erotically interested she and karmen dance together later karmen visits the wardens room and they make love unfortunately the scene is not detailed and is very short although there is some nuditykarmen then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man named lamine maybe a colonel it was never really clear who he was watches her he is with a young woman who dislikes karmens seductive dancing and there is a danceoff between the two womenafter that the story such as it is becomes even more muddledwith lamine in jail out of jail and who knows wherekarmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thievesthere is more singing more dancing and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from heartbreakthe film muddles its way to a finish and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended
1,terry and june in my mind is a all time classic along the ranks with bless this house with the late sid james and the late diana coupland but terry scott will be sadly missed even tho he passed away in i have all the dvds upto press and i look forward to getting all also would be nice to see happy after ever released on dvdjune whitfield is still going strong and terry scott will always live on in my memoryterry scott rip there arent many comedies today that i can think of that will stay in the legends list and yes the middle class bit does get on some peoples wicks but i dont mind i think it would be brilliant to see some celebration of the life of terry scott
1,i cant really condemn the movie because it does work there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie but i think its only just the categorytheres nothing sinister in this piece and thats where the noir elements fail the disease might considered sinister but i have a hard time seeing that the movie hints at a darker blackie may trafficking human beings the new orleans police are only too to arrest a reporter the specter of the plague hangs over of the in the movie but those are really only hintstheres no attempt made to question reeds motivations as one with do with marlowe or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played outthat lack of depth what fails the movie in endthe story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction are but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return over and over worth watching once maybe twice if you dont it from years ago and then putting away
1,one of the best shows out there if not the best one why simple guts to show real in prison any clichs and predictable twists this is not prison or any other show actually comparing to oz the sopranos look like story for childrens cursing shots of explicit violence and using drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes all this more in oz but this is not the best part of oz the are strongest point of this show theyre all excellent and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals the actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan oreilly and tobias beecher because so unique and their behavior completely and most of the dont have no remorse for their actions overall oz is amazing show the one out there about csi and shows about stupid doctors this is the deal oz

1,contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own riski loved this film the use rule of tinting in some of the scenes view makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and up she is projected behind him rather than in suffer a typical split screen tint her face is huge in the back and moving picture show leos is in the foregroundone of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost side of meat political poster style with facial rule close pair ups it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style brobdingnagian coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with rule the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtubyou backcloth can only see the red water on the side really it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepythe use of text sami in the film was unique like when leos character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a filmthe use of black comedy in this film son was well done ernsthugo jregrd is great as leos uncle it brings up the snickers i got from his role practice in the kingdom moving picture show riget leo the lion moving picture show this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness leo the lion of train conductors against sleep together the terrible backdrop of ww and all the chaos easier merely to take it be reminds me of riget in the way the deoxyadenosine monophosphate hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of induce part wreak information technology one when everything is ain going crazy it shows that some dozens people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about itthe oodles voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is wreak amusing too it draws you into the story and makes be you jump into leos head information technology which at times is a scary place to bethe movie brings up up the point that one is a coward if they dont choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer professional dancer in the dark where bjorks character doesnt speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but chute now i know his male characters dont red river fare well either i found myself thing at the same founder place a good deal during the end of dancer almost when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but foretell cheek of course they never do
1,wellmade but basically dreary lowlife melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert writerdirector pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesnt do him any compliments and he does seem to have been a troubled man as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot the acting is uniformly excellent however despite their relatively young age huppert and costar gerard depardieu as the title character were already at the forefront of modern french stars a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this dayi have more of pialats films in my vhs to watch pile albeit all in french without english subtitles due to this fact but also loulous oppressive realism in spite of its undeniable artistic merit i cant say that im in any particular hurry to check them out now
0,i saw mommywell she wasnt exactly kissing santa clause he has his hand on her thigh and wicked thoughts in mindthis was enough to emotionally scar a young boy who wanted to believe he grew up to be a bitter man who was upset at the quality of the toys being made and the lack of christmas spiritexpecting a real slasher flick i was very disappointed that less than a handful of people dies and there was no nudity at all what a bummeri wanted to like this flick but it was just too slow and really didnt have a good script i didnt expect great acting but i sure wanted some action there just wasnt any
0,this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time
0,what was this about predestination you can not change the it has already been written ill give it this much i want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole this a concept and made it watchableif youre looking for a recommendation see it at matinee prices no thrills but an interesting concept should have left the y reference out
0,right this moment i am watching this movie on tv here in tokyo beautiful scenery beautiful sets of biblical proportions beautiful costumes beautiful color beautiful gina great climactic scene when god destroys the sheban idol and a lot more with de millean thunderbolts at the moment when yul and gina are about to consummate their love yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines though he sounds a lot like yul delivering his lines as ramses or taras bulba george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders given the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this role gina does a good job though by the time the movie ends she is completely converted into a demure remorseful lass and looks likes she might be playing in a biography of mother teresa i guess thunderbolts will do that to you but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her new religion the supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing the usual big battle scenes what passed for lascivious dances in and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of ahs but none of it quite of topnotch hollywood quality the final swordfight between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a junior high school play the film is one big piece of eye candy but not much more
0,thats what this movie really takes a braggart piece of cheeze this movie is about a sister and brother bonny and clyde type of couple that make their own political party line in order to tempt their dupe in and trap them and kill them but for what reason just for the fun of getting away with it in comes richard hatch who comes across as a wishy faded ladies man a real bad version of a ladies man and he gets involved with finding whos behind all the killings across la he in conclusion meets a teenager who service him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement but there are set out in this film that really get me going like the picture with gladly garret dressed in his mothers marry nightdress acting like a sissy in front line of his sister telling her that he needs her and cant subsist without her and watching as she slaps him across the face rule him i cant believe that was gladly well i guess i could but its deserving watching but only to see one of garrets worst films that he ever did
1,this is being great movie to look at since it so more in by andrzej wajda works at the same time be wished the movie would had some more too powerful it in terms of its story its an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to in on the characters motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow it danton this charmingly brilliant and relevant movie to whatsomehow it so make the and any less great to watch this its made with fine and eye for detail every aspect about the movie is good looking such as its cinema costumes and cameraworkalso the story still works out as powerful though at the same time it could had been so much better and nicely in with a just bit other character development and insight historical it somewhat if youre completely familiar detail the french revolution and the stories but consider and robespierre in particular this movie will i a perfect other for you to watchits guess typical for a french movie wellgrard tell a story slowly and movie without ever stepping depth much directed with often this of out a but in this case the subtle could had concentrate done but been bit more depth other than that this movie is still one passion example movie french settings despite the fact could its a directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors in information as to depardieu is great focus his role though the movie also decides to really a lot on at one different characters the movie perhaps has a bit too many characters with each of brilliant performance is a great one doesnt though doesnt really ever become a big complaint more than that to slows done the story a bit many certain pointsa great movie that that had a every

0,not being a particular fan of westerns i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an i love lucy or lucy show type of role here she plays christine larson owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in whos about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent dean jagger balls performance was ok nothing really more than that she didnt blow me away it succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what im accustomed to seeing her in there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout a typical funny line theres two ways to deal with women and no one knows either one of them i didnt find the story all that compelling although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent theres typical shootout action and a lot of horses your typical western in other words as to christine we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up its just a question of how shes going to get there if you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in if youre not big on the genre this will be lacking im not big on the genre
0,the best thing about the movie is the crook name as it both describes the plot and the acting at least they cannot say they didnt warn you improving kind save of like the button labeled dont push thissegal must have run out of things that similar move like planes trains and ships aspirant but the plot remains the turnout same under cover place guy astatine who fights slowly but still beats like mercenary types and doesnt even blink when doing act so shepherds crook what amazes me piazza is that segal is cheap now as big as a george segal barn and thing the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and clips of ammo where do all these call really bullets actually go drop to the only redeeming feature of this movie is watching nia peeples inwards pound ja rule real name jeffrey atkins doesnt quite sound so punk into the floor i could dias spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that especially wearing an outfit like that adult female it was just a bonus watching jeffy get is ss kicked and fun hoping one patch of those kicks actually landed sorry its just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy cant act rappers out of the movies pleeeeease who came up with idea anyway id lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angelsthe only surprising twist distinguish in this movie is that they monish dont do the politically correct thing and have jeffy come in and save the day no doubt if snoop otherwise known by his momma as calvin broadus which again pattern doesnt sound so cool when you refer right away to him shepherds crook as inwards toughened cal had been in the movie hed throw some signs down on her and probably act saved segals life or something

1,with wwii over movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home the best years of our lives was probably the best example it portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their prewar lives but to the overall changing world probably the most interesting cast member is nonactor harold russell having lost his hands in the war he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else he went on to win best supporting actor and a special oscar for the role making him the only person ever to win two oscars for the same role there will probably always be debate over whether this deserved best picture more than its a wonderful life but i certainly think that they did a good job with it very well done
0,i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadnt seen one that i hadnt likedthe premise for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate childish inept putz i appreciate his passion for film but quit your whining if youre short on funds maybe you shouldnt have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you should have gone to film school or at least graduated from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting funny and poignant to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass if you want to do a documentary on a film maker why not do one on someone from china or iran a film maker with real problems two final questionswho takes a little kid to see apocalypse nowhow many times did this guy say man
0,living in edinburgh and have a great thirst for history i was very put off by the libertys taken wrong breed of dog for a start bobbys owner old jock was an old single man who came to edinburgh and died a pauper in lodgings not like in the film at all for anyone coming to edinburgh and hoping to see sights of the filmyou will not find the graveyard in princes st gardens there were a few moments were a tissues would have been great the actors were fantastic at padding out a rather flimsy script i dont feel the poor wee bobby actually got enough screen time possibly due to being lost at one point all that said the film was fine and any yr old will enjoy
1,so far miguel bardems career its been one of the more fiddling deoxyadenosine monophosphate dreadful of recent spanish cinema hes made nothing but rubbish until now incautos has been quite a surprise information technology its a serious film with rhythm with a great merely cast and very entertainingthe art of robbing sword thats what saint david incautos is about a film much alike but to david mamets house of game and stuff like merely that a thousand of twists in the script and a story where nothings like non it seemsthe weak points in latest bardems movie may be the soamerican language that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural especially present non victoria abrils shes a hell of an actress but in incautos she looks a little bit forced ernesto alterio is not that bad but hes almost not half as good actor as his father abnormal and what to say about luppi well feeling shambling shuffle hes the manin short a good movie the best that persona miguel bardem has ever made i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his careermy rate

0,jack brooks quirks sexual climax non are at first somewhat charming approximately and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this moviei found myself getting angrier and persona angrier as i was duped interim into seeing this one through to the end beggarly in hopes that first base the payoff would be worth the supertedious waitthe climax cant begin to make up for all the setup timenormally one might expect shallow characters from this genre but beggarly the fact that the waittimebeforeaction index is so high should mean that the meantime would be devoted to by design some interesting character developmentnot sowhile not without its initial be charms this movie ultimately infuriates and disappointswish i more or less could get all that setup time back captivate to reinvest it into something that pays off
0,the views of earth that are claimed this film to have been faked by nasa have been compared the historical weather data for the time of apollo and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video and the actual rainfall records on daythis would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the earth is actually a small of the planet framed by the spacecraft windowi waiting for bart sibrel to now the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in hands would still be a problemah a response trying discredit this movie by referring to weather data id say is a charming but and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie just packed with evidence against the claim once by us government that the moonmissions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say youll see things a bit different than beforefirst weather doesnt come from nasa comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously piece of film so edited it and added his own unfortunately him his source film is public domain and the bits edited his claims

0,i just saw this early this morning on the fox channel quite by accident my dog woke me up i had seen it years ago and thought i remembered it fairly well as a kid i had enjoyed it but now as another poster commented several of the reels were out of order and while it was disorienting at first and bizarre it seemed to fit the production what was just awful became surreal and amusing musical numbers for what i think was the big fundraiser showyoure in show business im in show business most of the kids are in show business lets put on a showcome out of nowhere before all the talk about putting on a show and then fade without applause to totally unrelated straight scenes the leading mans girlfriend shows up spits out lines and lines of dialogue then disappears i was half awake and loved every insane minute of it
1,my name is domino harvery edit dizzying chop mymymy name is domino harvey cut chop my name is domino harvey edit cut playbacknever have i seen a director take so much flack for his style before by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scotts choppy flashy dizzying editing technique if i have to choose between loving it and hating it id say i love it it was borderline distracting at times but the end result was pretty good and its nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality even if it borrows heavily from mtv videosthis stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her no matter how much she suffered we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez the crew become tangled up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walkens tv production company what is christopher walken doing in every film by the way i guess that is a clever film technique because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtvreality show editing footage as he likes it becomes a pastiche of mtv culture at this pointit followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapidfire pace with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence there are some funny jokes its all very modern and surreal at the same time its a mess but its a rather enjoyable mess it is ultimately flawed in so many ways the actors try too hard to make their characters cool for one but it works i give it a weak which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of moviegoers who graded this film but i feel it had some good ideas and executed them well out of

0,i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadnt seen one that likedthe premise for this film is a great one the well done there were some times early on when i and smiled yet the film on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the not been such an inarticulate childish inept i appreciate his passion for film but your whining if youre short on maybe you shouldnt have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you have gone to film school or at least graduated from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision there are so people out there with stories that are interesting and poignant see this chosen over any of them nothing less than crass if you want to a on a film maker why not do one on someone from china or a maker real problems final questionswho takes a little kid to see apocalypse nowhow many times did this guy say man
0,im a big winnow of horror flicks and zombie spirit films are a detail favorite of mine that said zombi is one of the absolute worst films i have ever check so needless to say i in truth enjoyed it its the best unsound movie ive check in a long while the level has some similarities with dan obannons devolve of the living dead but whereas that take was on purpose comic this one is the opposite it has some of the most laughable acting ive ever witnessed especially from the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical also the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy and the decease scenes are often just out and out stupid this of course makes it all the more merriment potential spoiler the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie spirit head which then opens its eyes and somehow pilot out of the electric refrigerator obviously pulled out fecklessly with a burn of string latch onto the guys neck killing him zombie spirit heading have the ability to float in the bare now it resist every law of physical science known to man and its one of the most absurd things ever filmed thats just one of many in truth goofy moments in the idiotic mess i cant believe its gotten so high a rating here if you are a winnow of unsound movies do yourself a favor and rent this sucker
0,i watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of blockbuster it is officially the only movie that ive wanted to undo watching let me start off by saying that i like b movies i consider ice pirates one of the best comedies ever ill also note that im a writer and that ive met the directorwriter of this cinematic marvelevaluating the acting if i was going to pick a bright spot id have to point out that dion day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this for those who dont know dion is a boxer not an actor so well forgive him his lame death sequence why doesnt he fire the shotgun hes holding once budget to highlight the bad acting would take pages so ill stick to the egotistical lead ryn baskin ryn which seems like a name chosen from a comic book because it sounded cool has maximum face time in this movie probably because he was a producer his looks are completely fine but his delivery evokes memories of snl ripping on soapoperas i suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him but part of the blame is definitely hisspecial effects not my specialty but for a lowbudget flick i suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable it didnt bother me but it also didnt impresswritingdirecting oscar for best screenplay is not something i can foresee gerald nott ever winning not only is the plot rudimentary but the dialog is flat and stilted i understand stylized hokeeness but this was just bad writing the thing that bothered me most was the theft nott stole scenes shots and viggos facial hair from a slew of other movies the scene where russel crow is walking through the wheat field in gladiator entire sequences from the good the bad and the ugly that sort of thing just doesnt cut it with me ill choose not to comment on the shooting because i dont know what it takes to establish a good shot etcconclusion dont rent this movie dont even pirate it its far too bad to waste any time on the good reviews may be entirely bogus after meeting gerry it seems more then likely that he is posting them himself
1,alice enters in a world of wonder but not the form of wonder that you remember as a kid the mad hatter the white person rabbit the queen and others even tweedledee and tweedledum show alice some things about her consistence and other peoples soundbox that might be quite fantastic a tale of love and lust the likes youve neer seenkristine debell come out as alice i must say by s standards this may be the most attractive grownup actress of her hour interval i trust this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work but it was fairly much the best possible one she could have pick out my love for all things alice is no secret even better than fairy tales which isnt really porn so muchthe songs are cheesy but fit the musical theme of the flick one song whats a fille like you doing on a knight like this was fairly funny and the others had standardised themes going the trial towards the end was well written and fit very nicely into the world of alice the logic and body fluid were definitely accounted forwhat more can you say about a film like this all i know is for multitude who are exploited to grownup films where its just a second leadin to the sexual urge this one is going to overload you with plot and medicine but personally i think theres something very special about this film and i hope it find a skillful dvd release with things touched up and special features if thats even possible i can see this being a fad film

0,recap not entirely familiar turns the shakespeare story of macbeth sets for wild guess is that this is pretty close modern the original only set in present time it tells the duncan of macbeth a member of a crime syndicate is melbourne he is a valued hitman and in the poetic of leader duncan the he and his lady has higher ambitions than something and plan the murder of story and any competition of the throne this is a much of betrayal and cold brutal deathcomments very interesting idea i must say to use the story but change the setting to present time but superfluous keep the original dialog it but movie huge contrast between the to poetic work and and violence promised within be extremely witchcraft that is a promise that it keeps but not in i out i rest it is very bloody indeed but of violence is slow not just and speaking that it in calculated which it is too but also literally a lot the action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie now its at could have been a unique strength the contrast between witchcraft still and actually dialog figuratively the extreme they to with into something else entirely way both at the move down then much so perhaps it it favor becomes dull and boring slow timesalso i cant figure notion but context the three witches act to set classical present time and reality the figure that such magical violent had no place in the a apparently it does but disappointment me it seems completely out of place not a subplot but a complete substory with its own rules completely different than the imagined of the movie seems director out of place surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something to druginduced hallucinations story which i suspect that the maybe hints kneeswhat but painfully he has left now too much the in it to be clear now violence only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story the i just waited my the real movie to begin againa believable to but completely that for shakespeareanbuffs
1,as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid at heart admit have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasnt been a good movie for quite some time note batman was not a good superhero i really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema read blair witch i wasnt disappointedmystery men was definitely not a higheffects tensionfilled action it was a and on that basis was a success it had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final stiller and garofolo are hilarious as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william macy plays a great straight man while kel mitchell and the fartpowered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happythough the sets are bizarre and at times seem from both batman and blade runner some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer offguard and bring tears from the bellylaughers among usi definitely recommend this although not an alltime classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread the is good and the is great youre worried plan on the matinee and pay but either way youll be pleasantly i mean among us root for losers once in a while
1,the biggest problem that the tv program key west faced was that it was advertised wrong if you the you would think it was a jiggle how and be sorely disappointed it was a vastly more complex show than that i happened to be in key west just before hurricane andrew hit and i think i actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in rum runners of course that was before show hit i did see the sailboat that was in the opening go by a few times and chatted with the who you see hacking up coconuts in the opening too he real local yes id love to see this on dvd

1,ok maybe it doesnt deserve an oscar or a golden globe or any award for that matter the acting isnt outstanding theres no reason to give credits to the directing and its really just another semigory st century slasher flick that most people will consider just decent or maybe even dreadful but in my opinion all of this doesnt matter a bit and thats because i had a great time watching this moviesure the first minutes are pretty slow but as the movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like i was and anybody else should be when watching this movie and that is looking for hours of fun mindless violence and a kickass ending which i wont spoil yes there are many flaws in this movie but dont let the cast list on the front cover fool you hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease that wasnt as nasty as anything an online popup would promise of her but still not so unbearable as to fastforward or turn off the dvdthe violence in this surprised me nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about these new movies called isaw and hostel but i could safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbingin conclusion im not surprised house of wax didnt make a place on the imdb top but it is definitely worth a look

1,tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films ive seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their fathers home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them shes prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her stepmother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what youve seen its a hell of a puzzler
1,many believe this movie is a baseball movie such people are disappointed because its about a baseball player but the movie isnt about baseballsome think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isnt really developed this movie is not a romantic comedythis movie is about culture an arrogant american major leaguer and a stern traditional japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they cant indeed wont understand one another its after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success the ballplayer becomes more japanese in his team mentality and the manager more american in allowing individual achievement and they meet in the middlebaseball and the romance is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures many who have no understanding of the japanese mindset miss this and think its a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy relief its notthe culture clash is the gravamen of the movie based on my own experience and understanding of the japanese culture i think this movie did quite well in that it didnt overly romanticize the japanese culture nor overdo it in its portrayaloverall i believe this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about

0,the way road house was a classic supporting s movie which although decided didnt have anywhere suggested award worthy house or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film the due to the one the star patrick swayze and the this cheesy cast loving with some excellent fight scenes and it candy years later and dvd sony attempts to recreate the magic which left you amazing quoting presence liners of reciting example three rules of bouncing with a be which quotes get the originals killed one liners and recites the three ruleswere this an amateur fan made film would it be live as a a homage to one of the end popular of to movies as a professionally made film eye falls flat on its face right into the dispatch bargin bin way its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign to lack the originality rather than that references to the originalhaving said bill with new lines such as im gonna point you just like i killed your father no wonder the screenwriters it the rehash much of the original film knew this was never going to be anything special road a straight to a sequel but i had at least hoped cool there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things good swayzes being up of the road writing name but what us all is simply just a remake of the same film with father little narcotics added inwere i the director id have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish of original and wont characters as even is attempt got patrick swayzes character now supposed to movie dead best off screen in a lame strangely by jake busey and his brother and son now to main characters who original enough have completely different surnamesmy favourite part was that daltons ison drove largely same car his along did a this cool homage although it was later ruined by having the car meet its most exactly of same with as its predecessor did thats a good the and how genuinely disappointed goes too far in like sequences and ideas from the moviealso of course who can forget to legendary moment where wild that promises to kill shane just including i killed your father and then proceeds to you to dvd him in a completely different manner all writing there i see schaech is listed as coscreenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothingoverall though this is an ok film hardcore theres nothing else the watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and mgm half or if of havent seen the first seen house but if fans of swayzes classic of be totally scripti almost to the kill we feeling insulting is how much will a rip off this movie at of the first as someone once near as an alternative subtitle for great film it jeff healy is glad he its be seeing this one stick to the original road house and relive the included old swayze days
0,oliver gruner is totally unknown to me my friend showed me this film because he had seen gruner in what he called a pretty good scifi film nemesis so as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through the bs drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences gruner loves to kick and kick and kick and kick hahagruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in he finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family instead of joining up gruner tells the boy to fight back against a gang too crazy gruner plays a typical van damme character who kills everyone or maims them pretty bad and works to rid his block of these gangmembersthe plot was very cheesy and easy to think of gruner is probably not very well known because of his scriptchoosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to this ghetto is pure hell and i enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against gruners character the music was typical action music thumping pianos and timpani swelling guitars which actually wasnt as bad as i make it sound the director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every minutes for a tense family momentultimately i gave it a because it really tried to be an average action film for oliver gruner to star in but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw
0,i really liked the far cry game nice graphics good leveldesign interesting and clever enemies aboveaverage length and even a somewhat decent plot i am not by default against movie spinoffs of games i thought doom the movie was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible well not the length the movie runs only a merciful min the characters are even more stereotypical than in the game which is quite an achievement the entire plot is told without any twists or mystery several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story and come on genetically modified soldiers they could have come up with some better namehowever this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene i have never seen anything of the like i could not believe they were trying to be serious we have to get out of the wet clothes i think ill get hypothermia although everybody is wearing tshirts we need to cuddle together for body warmth is that your gun but but werent there people who consciously did this there must have been a scriptwriter a director actors a gaffer an electrician some food guy why didnt anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening was this film done by ravaging inhuman genetically modified film people i wont start at ranting about how many logical errors inconsistencies and scriptwriting flaws there were but even to the diehard actionfan this cant be anything but insultingthis film did actually ask for being rated out of so ill do it that favor but that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from specialeffects nah acting not really references to the game you wish wait they used the font from the game for the title and the credits that was neatif you are looking for a flick for a bad movie night go for supernova this one is just sad

1,on the true story charlie wilson an american congressman who according to this movie was instrumental in usas covert war afghanistan against the soviet unioncomments a funny movie about not so funny things since they were real but focusing on the movie hanks performs very well as a womanizing congressman with a heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in afghanistan hanks and the entire movie seymor hoffman especially has a rather humorous tone so much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate but the story that it tell and maybe the ending the most are indeeda story of what happened with some questions about what have been so the movie works a comedy if you want one and a much more serious if you want that something for everybody

1,this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection comics underground japan and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this as it explains some of the plot of the movie which is otherwise inexplicable animation wise this is pretty decent good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well it jumps in and out of episodes as the characters a cat and his braindead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go through a number of semiplots and settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the longrunning manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually knowing whats going on might somewhat increase appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show cartoon sushi in particular a short that features a cat chasing a mans severed buttcheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to tell whats going on the dvd of this has directors commentary and a making of features but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them im giving this a for now here isnt much to compare it to in anime and i hope for more like this

0,fine so it was written in before so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorist and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed flat out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient thats it thats the good lug the actingfair the plotsilly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isnt as though no one ever thought of what to do when a flat gets contaminated dont you opine bureaucrats have a manual of arms for plagues and how to hold in them proper carrying out of such a architectural plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a architectural plan it isnt to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the ventilate why was the flat door open up and the shooters standing there with no auspices in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her wooden leg that would turn back her but not as spectacular im a sucker i always scout a movie to see the last once i come out it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a record keeper so i didnt have to scout all the advertising that was a positive its a good example of why i scout so little network video rubbish
1,poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure youre in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life
1,the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by shunya ito the series star meiko kaji would complete the series in the fourth installment grudge song directed by the capable yasuhara hasebe who also directed kaji in the excellent stray cat rock sex hunter the original female prisoner scorpion is one of my alltime favorites the sequel jailhouse is nearly as good its generally considered the best of the series and i might agree i think if it ever gets a better release on dvd the original by image is very poor beast stable in my opinion is nearly as good as fp its much slower much more contemplative it has its share of violence and nastiness but theres more focus on the story and the characters sasori kaji eludes detectives in the first scene she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed and hooks up with a freelance prostitute yuki yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofylooking madame with a cage full of pet crows what really surprised me is how sad the movie is yukis story which is never resolved it heartbreaking the images are startling and itos direction is masterful its too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the fp series this is an awesome film

0,underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of ichikawa somegoro alas it got lost in all the goo the scenes of old edo with the courtesan drifting on the sumida rehearsing and acting in the nakamuraza were all exciting and engaging taking you back to an interesting and rich era the action on the kabuki stage in which somegoro excels and excites was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed the skill the energy in the audience the colors of the sets were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance what a wasted opportunity one of the best kabuki actors alive and he gets lost in the dreck
0,how could anyone who liked the previous jp movies even stand to sit through this of drivel there are so many stupid things this film its mind boggling i remember when i went to see jp as a kid it was my favorite movie franchise acting sfx music the direction all fantastic jp in my opinion was ok pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments like the girl kicking a raptorplease but on whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experiencebut third one has no point its supposed to be a sequel that carrys on from jp and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would been impossible to miss on the previous films the mega spinosaurus seriously what the this thing follows them everywhere they go they cannot escape its presence and yet in the lost world the same island do you see it once do you hear it does anyone even mention no its the star character in the previous movies was and always will be the trex so what does the durrirector joe johnston do kill it off as soon as you see the huge trex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and see it again a new on the town is the excuse where did it come from not a single explanation and dont get me started on the whole satellitephoneinthedinobelly thing just when you start get over how stupid the spinosaurus is you see the aside from their new punk haircuts they pretty credible phew they will make this movie watchable right wrong now they speak to each other and excuse for them speaking in film not in the first and second arewait for it evolution yes process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended amazing surly they should grown thumbs and created by now ok am not going to say anymore about the plot because its getting up my nose so i will close on this jurassic park is a classic jp is lousy sucker punch to any of the original fans of the series my favorite franchise was well and truly dead after watching this monstrosity no pun intended this movie like the plague

1,without going into any details of a goodif a somewhat provocativetv movie there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is no one to blame herei disagree yes the young male lover of beverly dangelo played by rob estes may be young and horny and good looking because hes not getting as much as he wants from mom that doesnt mean he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter ok he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch tv with her but i dont buy it people have to take responsibility for their actions not only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable teen when he was supposedly the responsible adulthe said your mom must never know about this how responsible was he then yes its a good flick but he got what was coming to him dont kid yourselves folks that what happened was no ones fault
0,i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent bgrade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess

1,mobile suit gundam wing auto is the fourth inwards series in to a greater extent the continuing gundam chronicles unlike the previous entries pass off which focused on war mortal but massive wars this one is a little different instead of having an armyvsarmy oink situation this one is led by five teenage boys due to their ability to blend pass off in more readily along than normal adults and their machines called gundams because of the metal alloy full hither used in their construction which leads to problems since gundams are supposed to be destroyed replaced by mobile suits which are piloted lessdestructive weapon platforms and dolls which are ran on ai and are used mortal as grunt infantrythe whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes its way here especially since most anime is adapted from to a greater extent popular magazines such as time of year sami naruto dragonball one piece dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from ground shonen jump which is now available in americamobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of overthetop battles between mortals who more resemble gods gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully normally be in anime there are more than few series that think morass that world health organization the best way to go about having a small battle is to have similar it take a halfhour something that would wooing uranium never happen in real life gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines will be destroyed and rebuilt oink battles will be lost and won and it never seems form as though it makes the actions themselves satiricalbut the magic of gundam wing is in the details and meld what this series has that more anime would live on be grateful for having fashion emotion instead of mythic prophecies magic or bring home the bacon overblown martial arts live on gundam wing is hardline science fiction from a country that hates hardline science supercede fiction shuffle note the author would like in to state that neon genesis evangelion is not hardlineplausibleinreallife science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of serial publication its deoxyadenosine monophosphate series they love proceeds star wars but hate ai be the movie henceforth why gundam ok wing was and nifty gundam seed is now serial publication in production for both japanese and us releases at the same rattling time with two voice teams american audiences only have to wait two or to a greater extent three weeks after the end of the japanese thither season all to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed hard line mythologic episodes that information technology air on cartoon networkthe emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards the heroes are those who sequence defend the rights of the whatsoever more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam shambling wing this is not war this is total war every person every building every street is a target for attack both on earth and offmy only complaint and the reason it didnt get the score of ten is that at about threefourths of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change kind of like a presenttime flashback which is fine due to what it reveals about suffer the characters kernel but at the to a greater extent same time it drags down what merely sleep together should be the brewing between project meteor and oz but the final two unlike episodes and the overplayedoncartoonnetwork back in mobile suit gundam wing closing endless waltz movie inwards more than make up for the slack
1,in my mind the occupy best of the diligence ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time the theme of workers v management with lots of talk of unions and rights perhaps dates the film a bit now as its no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesnt stop particular date white suit from being a a show stopping classicthe plot about a nifty man trying lean to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil doesnt sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential marvel spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks deoxyadenosine monophosphate present it out as a true ealing comedy the fabric repels dirt and epoch can never wear out the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second dramatic play half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences place such as guinness being able to use his cast of characters right away indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is full of dry wit is he all right yes pity and characterisation is first rate im epoch always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films play as well comedies of later eras would joy adopt a point the camera at swallow up the actors and let it right down roll mentality a good deal but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations this film is no exceptionof course its the cast pleasure that lifts the material to dizzying heights nick alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance with eyes that convey wonder joy and crushing defeat joy whenever the story demands it stratton is a man oblivious to everything except confessedly undestroyable his work such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but operating theater guinness effortlessly makes him likable so much so be that the closing stages of maneuver the film generate a real sense of urgency not bad as stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything hes ever worked for joan greenwood plays another of her common strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual inwards as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough everybody gets laughs without even trying to its comical diligence british understatement swallow up at its finestthe man in the white suit information technology is closedown minutes of sheer brilliance with chip a great plot operating theater great cast sparkling wit and information technology healthy dollops of cynicism absolutely top notch
0,i love musicals all of them from joyous oklahoma to poignant porgy and bess to the touching romantic damn yankees and i know most of the songs sometimes singing them spontaneously with a crowd or humming them alonein a real musical as differentiated from this vaudeville show every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment it is an expression of sadness regret love joy or exaltationa natural extension where mere words fail so in guys and dolls my time of day describes the adventurous life of sky masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood or develops a character creating a phantasmagoria of place turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of songfor this lover of the broadway musical and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the th century mama mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre there the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate often delightful plot lines while here the songs simply picked up from a collection only interfered with the shaky premise of the filmperhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of th century musicals they have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love as achieved in sweet charitylet me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review perhaps another day another mood i could have gotten into it and not have been so critical in this reviewbut i cant help but imagining what richard roger oscar hammerstein cole porter irving berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise i think about it while the memories of seeing this film is fresh and i can not help but to mourn the great loss
1,ahead for the first ten minutes or so of witness were introduced to a quote typical urban american family unquote in a nameless city is another way of saying warner brothers version of nyc except for young children including the moore and sprightly sally blane theyre a pretty dreary lot and dinner table conversation is tedious we wish the story would move along and bring in star walter huston but wait folks wait all of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out drawing family in against their will after that this baby never lets up suspense an oscarnominated script good acting you want old movies to beit is here i do question chic sales performance he must be an acquired taste but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot hes treated to special in the credits so warner bros must have really been high on sale but how his corny old man routine fit with the public is something lost to me it is lost to time period an unknowable factor you had to be a moviegoer to understand also the climax is typically melodramatic nevertheless this right now is best release of the studio that year i seen so ive only eight so perhaps thats an inconclusive view do not miss this when shows it out of
1,the first film was a nice one but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired but the dogs are very cute here and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumesespecially cruellas and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very good ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruellas accomplice but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously overthetop performance as cruella even more evil than she was previously overall nice bethany cox
1,i wasnt expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face julie walters rupert grint and laura linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about ben rupert grint does this when he meets retired actress evie julie walters and begins to express his ideas with words he slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter of the time the film satisfies all and i hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities it is a must see
1,bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesnt get any better than this zadoras overacting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such dont miss ray liottas debut film line looks like a penis
0,forest of the damned starts out as five young friends brother sister emilio richard cambridge ally sophie holland along with judd daniel maclagan molly nicole petty andrew david hood set off on a week long holiday in the middle of nowhere their words not mine anyway before they know it theyre deep in a forest emilio clumsily runs over a woman frances da costa along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van theyre travelling in wont start they cant get any signals on their mobile phones they need to find help quickly so molly judd wander off in the hope of finding a house as time goes by darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone that there is something nasty lurking in the woodsthis english production was written directed by johannes roberts having looked over several other comments reviews both here on the imdb across the internet forest of the damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it others not personally it didnt do much for at all the script is credited on screen to roberts but here on the imdb it lists joseph london with additional screenplay material whatever that means the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like the texas chainsaw massacre with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction then theres stephen played by the ever fantastic tom savini who is never given any sort of justification for what he does is he there to get victims for the angels if so why did he kill andrew by bashing his head in the story is very loose it never felt like a proper film the characters are poor the dialogue not much better the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything thats going on having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace there are a couple of decent scenes heredirector johannes doesnt do anything special its not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at theres a few decent horror scenes the tom savini character is great whenever hes on screen although why didnt he hear judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with molly its a shame when he gets killed off there are a couple of decent gore scenes here someone has their head bashed in theres a decapitation someone gets shotgun blasted someone throat is bitten out someones lips are bitten off someone is ripped in half there is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity not that it helps muchtechnically forest of the damned is ok its reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eyecatching this was shot in england wales its quite odd to see an english setting for a very american themed backwards horror the acting is generally pretty poor save for savini who deserves to be in better than this horror author shaun hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end proves he should stick to writing rather than actingforest of the damned was a pretty poor horror film it seems to have fans out there so maybe im missing something but its not a film i have much fondness for apart from one or two decent moments theres not much here to recommend
1,at last ive finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now ive only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the s with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possiblethis was the lovely meena kumaris film from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from on finally realising it in what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah necessitating a body double in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her facethe story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but im led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india its a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but to me its the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding ive seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here albeit a classic duet with lata because of all this but not blind to its faults pakeezah is my favourite indian movie filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra

0,the amount of hype and the huge success this film has encountered is evidence how desperate our people are towards a good independent saudi film in fact the huge success of tash ma tash is also an evidenceim not going to start of how important film making is as it is obvious to those with half a brain how films have changed the worldand im not going to say how much our society needs a bunch of films to clear out a lot of issues we have in our country religion politics womens rights education general health terrorism law and many many morealong came news about the fist saudi movie which shouldve been a remedy to some of the issues we have especially towards the youth instead we experienced a bald movie for that matterthe ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious it was as if a year old had written itnow ive heard that the budget for this film was huge i would like to know where the money went huh the effects were really ugly the editing was poor the script was kharabeet you really dont know what the story is and what the director aims at from this filma note on the actor who played the religious brother his performance was good but with bad direction another thing with the role of the religious friends he had that is not how religious guys act here in saudi arabia they are not evil as this film intends in fact they are some of the nicest people youll ever meet with some really uncommon way of living and that is what shouldve appeared in the filmthe youth are following the religious here because of a reason and that is the youngsters are the most passionate and sentimental and with the well formed principles the religious live on the youngsters follow them again this is what shouldve appearedwe need another first film with a saudi writer actor director composer even cameraman so that they all work with passion towards their experiment not just for the moneyand we should do what shakespeare did hundreds of years ago we should include phrases from the quran in the script of the movie as the people in our society still see art as a form of sin the challenge a saudi movie maker is facing is changing the mentality in that angle
0,im probably one of the few people who fight down and even enjoy frisking the project that cast todd verow on the map if that is indeed where he is i appreciated that person had the bowel to take on dennis cooper and not back forth from the material verow fairly rolls around in it estimate from what hes done since then hes wellsuited for that type of material and should probably stick to it vacationland a wouldbe teenage coming out film is so misdirect in so many ways it becomes unplanned comedy and im foiled i have to report thatfirst off our hero the high train old joe is interahamwe too honest to god in appearance to be make for when we later meet a man who is supposed to be joes instructor its confusing as the sweatyfaced bozo looks much young than the student hes teaching joes mother looks young than he does and doesnt turn any old either second in joes opening scenes he looked like he was either make for or in reality experiencing mental challenges to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was make for thomas young but it just wasnt workingit was weirdits moment in before anything is reveal about who what and where these people are and why we should care the second scene in the film is an lengthy bit of business in a mens toilet room that considering where the storey goes later is absolutely superfluous the subplot with the instructor goes nowhere at all even as a rite of passage for our thomas young heroone minute of arc joe is nervously trying his paw at bathroom stall sex a scene so unerotic it shuffle you truly wonder what anyone sees in the use the following minute of arc hes an expert at sexual blackmail and violent doublecrossing this is take after by an lengthy scene with the character considerably later learn is saint andrew the apostle and thats about all we learn about him other than hes apparently gay but not out yettheres a wad crammed in to the running time which is about moment too longi jargon imagine how it diddle with the mindnumbingly longsighted and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around a subplot copped from gods and monsters with an get on patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of

tired stereotype who live only to be degraded blackmail theft murder alcohol consumption and abuse of curl music software for soundtrack recordingwhat you will not find in this moving picture show are any interior demonstrate skipper shaft were expect to imagine were in an airport grocery store office and schoolroom as all the scenes in these locations consist of closeups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locale that the production mustiness not have been able to afford one thing they were able to get appears to have been an real gay bar either its the worst bar in the world or there are only about gay humankind in bangor maine as the bar never has any patrons in it another good chuckle hail when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very plainly wasnt coming from the speakers but was just more of the monotone loopmusic of the scoreplots and characters come and work emotions are unreadable and the dialogue clearly inspired by dennis cooper is filmspeak meaning no humans in reality talk this way since we arent impart any information about these characters its impossible to care about what happens to them its as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to live once the credit entry wind for certain the character of joes baby a wannabee jennifer white haired who is bohemiacrazy seems to just simply occlusive we never know where she is in la or what her problem isbut againdoes it matter visually the film looks very good at times more a will to new developments in hidef video than anything i suspect the edit is jolly clunky though there was one great edit joe is posing naked and enjoin i wanted to turn athletics but and we cut to a shot let on his butt ha ha composition is also odd at times i suppose i was watching sctvs parody of persona when the son were talking together in do it and visually it looked as if their noses were adhere together for the whole sceneone senses verow is really restraining himself from induce a naughtier or pretty pugnacious moving picture show like he unremarkably does and mayhap he shouldnt have held back the frothy toothpastesex fantasy worked nicely i suppose though the quality was out of touch with the rest of the moviehe produces and directs this sensitive coming of years storey much like herschell gordon john l lewis guide films without

0,how could anyone who liked the previous jp movies even stand to sit through this hour of drivel there are so many stupid things about this film its mind boggling i remember when i went to see jp as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise the acting the sfx the music the direction all fantastic jp in my opinion was ok pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments like the gymnast girl kicking a raptorplease but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experiencebut the the third one has no point its supposed to be a sequel that carrys on from jp and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous films for example the new mega spinosaurus seriously what the hell this thing follows them everywhere they go they cannot escape its presence and yet in the lost world the same island do you see it once do you hear it does anyone even mention it no its ridiculous the star character in the previous movies was and always will be the trex so what does the durrirector joe johnston go and do kill it off as soon as you see the huge trex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again a new dino on the town is the excuse where did it come from not a single explanation and dont get me started on the whole satellitephoneinthedinobelly thing just when you start to get over how stupid the spinosaurus is you see the raptors aside from their new punk haircuts they seem pretty credible phew they will make this movie watchable right wrong now they speak to each other and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the first and second arewait for it evolution yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended amazing surly they should have grown opposable thumbs and created tools by now ok i am not going to say anymore about the plot because its getting up my nose so i will close on this jurassic park is a classic jp is a lousy sucker punch to any of the original fans of the series my favorite franchise was well and truly dead after watching this monstrosity no pun intended avoid this movie like the plague

0,i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film look at it a month later and you might see it differently or dig it up after years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival aided by the films director and producer gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches ma film directors this was not an overly ishocking film there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious filmmaking on the promise of a controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived overemphasised and sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and the figleaf reference marquis de sade as one audience member put it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finalewe have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence when pushed robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside himthe film is not entirely without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way was it the influence of his peers why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life cinematically there is a carefullymontaged scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs shyness a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat a dj is more concerned that the girls screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way robert slumps with his back to us in the foregroundbut the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention if they vomit we have succeeded in producing a reaction but mostly and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality filmmaking director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet even his defence that there is little plot development because he didnt want to do a standard hollywood movie all are good answers to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths one aspect of art is to educate another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workandy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his ability at the moment only extends to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film
1,i that love actionadventure films and this is one of the best it course we love the stars it this genre bruce willis sly stallone clint eastwood kurt the arnold schwarzenegger and the rest but its great story the really wolfgang the best are somewhat feasible but we as of those that are a little over the top as in warmth comic book style of action the more twists and turns the more dire situations miss heroes are by a and real more shocking moments in the film the more we actionadventure fans enjoy them in moment line of fire has all the elements required for a riproaring action thriller it has clint eastwood as in nearretirement secret service agent whose one bad russell of of haunts him of has one of really most evil despicable maniacal villains in john malkovich the it in which you cant wait to see him get his and type has rene russo the the love interest a has twists due turns an occasional shock and even failure touch of the and humor it is extremely well paced by director counts petersen and even has a score involved the the ennio morricone this one is a can roller coaster ride tolerate a thriller dont the it

0,i went to see evening because of the cast id gone to see normans room for that reason that movie offering diane keaton leonardo de caprio and also meryl streep and had loved every minute of it same for the notebook even though it was chickflit lite and my feeling was anything offering performances by vanessa redgrave meryl streep patrick wilson and glenn close would be at least as good instead i found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite simplistic and on one occasion truly offensive materialnow i had no problem with the way the film was structured i actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a storyso long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse but while vanessas character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt was a mistake was riveting at times the part actually showing what that past mistake was does nothing to clarify the matter in fact it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest girl meets boy girl gets boy girl loses boy fashion and in the most unbelievable clichd wrongheaded way possibleand from here be spoilers so bear that in mind should you continue readingfirst of all claire danes was brutally miscast not only does she not even begin to resemble vanessa redgrave as a young woman she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting dont get me wrong she can be good in the right role just not this one and patrick wilson was miscast though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off hed have been better suited to the part hugh dancy played the rich confused wasp and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all hes a bit too waspy for that hugh dancy one note im a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why and the why im a closet case in a sexually repressed world so i have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone i know was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died as you knew he would because thats the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the fifties so ludicrous wrongheaded and mishandled i nearly threw my candy at the screenas for the modern part between toni collette and her sister her fear of commitment her jealousy of her sisters perfect life her sister wondering if shes made the right choices her pregnancy and her tooperfect boyfriend which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by patrick wilson and ebon mossbachrach might have been a more interesting harris given his dreamy eyes anyway all this was hashed over in the s and s and in much greater depth do we really have to present it again and all as if it was fresh and momentousand to top it off meryl streep doesnt even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions shes still good but only because shes meryl and meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeupso to put it simply this movie has every clich in the really meaningful message movie book and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out again at two hours long and laced with lifetime movieoftheweek music that is guaranteed to rub you raw its a complete failure in both the meaningful and moviemaking aspects i give it only because of meryl and vanessanow if all you require from your films is twadd le then please set my comments about evening aside and have the time of your life but if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings rent normans room and find out what truly great acting is

0,this is one of those movies that apparently was excuse to ride the martial arts wave craze kind of like billy pretty any guess however whereas billy jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one we you i some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing so such unless are introduced to the star who is described as in learned judo having the macarthur consider result in the marines he while they are jack established in and i really dont remember i emphasis on judo as a was the antagonist james marines makes reference to the judo when he offers an trying for why boxing a state champion wrestler was as easily defeated lame
0,the film moves small quite cos but the and direction and somewhere leave a lot to be desired the characters are mostly lifted from other films and the he jones stupid is straight out of gone in seconds the comedy gangster movie details a genre that should have lots out contrast the lookalike dealers fixed lock have and once shoot of that leaves everyone dead you more never imagination know whether to for or just sit there in shock this movie had clint right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut at the the is that should have been in editing along the laugh and along belief has been unsuspended one just become increasingly critical a pity well it was a brave attempt and although clint eastwood is famous line saying thatll be ok for a scene vinnie puts and work in before he shoots and he is the eastwood here a bit more really with the camera the and a bit should coaching acting rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would stock made a big difference
1,i gave it an only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it i like the eclectic killer because he didnt kill people the same way everytime that sometimes gets old
0,the female cast of this movie is terrific youve got linda blair maturing nicely julie strain who doesnt get too many speaking lines thats a good thing rochelle swanson equally convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as an evil possessed girl toni naples and the most beautiful of them all imo the simply stunning kristina ducati how the goofy male lead larry poindexter deserved to get sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery however beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women the movie has little to offer the plot is disjointed and doesnt really get going until the last minutes or so and when wynorski finally manages to create some suspense a ludicrous twist ending comes and ruins everything
0,this hal roach comedy short a tough winter is the ninetyninth in the our ganglittle rascals series and the eleventh talkie bascally a showcase for black comic stepin fetchit who gets special billing here we see him going to his shack where the gang hangs out farina retrieves a love letter from the mail for him and is told by stepin to read it since he cant read it during the day as he goes to night school it happens to be from his sweetheart in tennesse so now farina has to have his ears stuffed with cotton since its too hot for him to hear in another room weezer relays instructions to mary ann of making taffy from the radio but because he keeps running back and forth to the kitchen he misses the lady announcers segue to rice pudding and spanish tamale confusing mary ann with additions of tabasco and lux after the concoction is completed jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with the awful tasting but very sticky substance as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result as they all try to clean the mess stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that mixes variable appliances functions such a telephone that vacuums a vacuum that rings and a refrigerator that plays music the end what ive just described portends the meandering nature of this our gang short that served as the pilot for a potential stepin fetchit movie short series its just as well that it never took place as fetchits characterization of the lazy negro was amusing only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today many of the scenes ive just described are good for some laughs though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me so in summary a tough winter is a curio worth seeing at least once by the way stepins real name was lincoln theodore perry
0,being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this filmi was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute rollercoaster ridealaswhere to start on this messi think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funnyi was still waiting for the first laugh after a good minutes of viewingmany aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cutthe overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the terrible guest house the buffoons attempt to runbut to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been createdthe actingat timesis patheticfenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and ive seen simon pegg have much better outingsid recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much morebut to any bottom fan who hasnt seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned
1,if your a hard core fan then you might not like it this to be a spoof of the nightmare series not much to see here the only it holds it self up is the back story on freddythe one thing that is always great nightmare the death the death scenes were very crappy the visual effects were great the acting was ok but the back story excellent freddys story comes full circle in thisi have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this its many flaws a on elm street freddys dead the final nightmare a nightmare on elm street the dream master a nightmare on elm street the dream warriors nightmare on elm street the dream child a nightmare on elm street freddys revenge i recommend it if you enjoy the series this is were freddy is fully explained thats all there is next on my list wes cravens new
0,im probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy frisk the project that put todd verow on the map if that is indeed where he is i appreciated that someone had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material verow fairly rolls around in it judging from what hes done since then hes wellsuited for that type of material and should probably stick to it vacationland a wouldbe teen coming out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy and im disappointed i have to report thatfirst off our hero the high school senior joe is far too old in appearance to be playing when we later meet a man who is supposed to be joes teacher its confusing as the sweatyfaced guy looks much younger than the student hes teaching joes mother looks younger than he does and doesnt act any older either second in joes opening scenes he looked like he was either playing or actually experiencing mental challenges to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was playing young but it just wasnt workingit was weirdits minutes in before anything is revealed about who what and where these people are and why we should care the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a mens toilet room that considering where the story goes later is absolutely superfluous the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a rite of passage for our young heroone minute joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex a scene so unerotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice the next minute hes an expert at sexual blackmail and violent doublecrossing this is followed by an extended scene with the character well later learn is andrew and thats about all we learn about him other than hes apparently gay but not out yettheres a lot crammed in to the running time which is about minutes too longi cant imagine how it played with the mindnumbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around a subplot copped from gods and monsters with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously cant remember his lines he is conveniently dispatched with in a way dickens might have come up with on a slow week a mixnmatch almostfourway between the boys and their girlfriends a gaybashing toilet tramp a wouldbe wise sage in the form of a nellie queen and hasnt the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker with the heart of gold as most tired stereotype who exists only to be degraded blackmail theft murder alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recordingwhat you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots were expected to imagine were in an airport grocery store office and classroom as all the scenes in these locations consist of closeups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar either its the worst bar in the world or there are only about gay men in bangor maine as the bar never has any patrons in it another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasnt coming from the speakers but was just more of the droning loopmusic of the scoreplots and characters come and go emotions are unreadable and the dialog clearly inspired by dennis cooper is filmspeak meaning no humans actually talk this way since we arent given any information about these characters its impossible to care about what happens to them its as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll certainly the character of joes sister a wannabee jennifer grey who is bohemiacrazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is in la or what her problem isbut againdoes it matter visually the film looks very good at times more a testament to new developments in hidef video than anything i suspect the editing is pretty clunky though there was one great edit joe is posing naked and says i wanted to play sports but and we cut to a shot revealing his butt ha ha composition is also odd at times i thought i was watching sctvs parody of persona when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole sceneone senses verow is really restraining himself from making a naughtier or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does and maybe he shouldnt have held back the frothy toothpastesex fantasy worked nicely i thought though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the moviehe produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like herschell gordon lewis directed films without goreporn films without sex in them i got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasnt boring it just wasnt very good either
1,some high risk bad inwards reviews here for this and wherefore i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might cover be get more from it than nether mosti thought that this worked in a academic degree way because thither afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isnt iti would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the reexamine acting is maybe a bit too uneven david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look
1,so far miguel bardems career its been one of the more dreadful of recent spanish cinema hes made nothing but rubbish until now incautos has been quite a surprise its a serious film with rhythm with a great cast and very entertainingthe art of robbing thats what incautos is about a film much alike to david mamets house of game and stuff like that a thousand of twists in the script and a story where nothings like it seemsthe weak points in latest bardems movie may be the soamerican language that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural especially victoria abrils shes a hell of an actress but in incautos she looks a little bit forced ernesto alterio is not that bad but hes not half as good actor as his father and what to say about luppi well hes the manin short a good movie the best that miguel bardem has ever made i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his careermy rate

0,the ghost of the vietnam war has haunted the american psyche for thirty years now if not because of the fact that tens of thousands of american soldiers went mia in vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that america could be said to have lost many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves and the original first blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world as the saying goes first blood part ii on the other hand is little more than a fistpumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore america can be both in victory and defeat stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular special forces commando while richard crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient where it all comes undone is in the script which didnt do any better when it was called missing in action and starred chuck norris what little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone as the filmmakers decide to paint a big s on rambos massive chestthe film picks up a little while after the end of first blood the film that is the novel didnt allow for the possibility of sequels in this mediocre followup rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of openair mine as he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with colonel trautman who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission rambo never one to back down from a hard days violent work accepts and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be cambodia or thailand i forget which from there he is commissioned to seek out a camp where american mias are supposedly being held and photograph them his mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release rambo being rambo however has other ideas in spite of their possible political implicationsof course things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning rambos work have more interest in making sure no american mias are found it is the ageold conspiracy theory and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an american family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official vietnam war had been raging for of course with the jingoism that was inherent in american society during the s they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of russians together the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from rambo but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets arrows rockets and destruction about the only thing missing is the moment when rambo drinks from a graillike chalice and declares himself invincibleto be honest first blood part ii is a wellphotographed and wellchoreographed action spectacle the handtohand combat with the larger russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever the rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for americans to pump their fist to fortunately this fad of america ber alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as platoon began doing the rounds some of the kills shown here are quite creative despite all the problems the vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy the russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous only in a s action film would one see a law being used from inside a helicopter sure there have been action film clichs rooted in contradictions of fact but never this ridiculous beforei gave rambo first blood part ii a one out of ten it is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny one doesnt even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are the only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved keep the tongue firmly in the cheek and it might be watchable

0,spoilers beware flashdance is a fair in my opinion some things do confuse me about it eg jeanie asks alex how long took for her to get so good dancing replies about years isnt alex supposed to be and some things do fascinate me about it i the spins though it intrigued me when this was i wasnt born i didnt really experience the eighties i was born in and i have to wonder sometimes alex would run in place a bit or throw herself all over not really dancing just banging in to tossing her head back waving her armswas this considered dancing back then if it was im not sure i couldve standed it the spins the flip the fluid movements were great some of itmy neighbors toddler couldve done better also if alex is a welder during day wouldnt she be tired after a hard days work when she doesnt to work for nearly a week wouldnt she be laid off living a warehousei can almost see it but not quite it doesnt seem right that shes a welder owns a warehouse house and is trying to get ballet none of it really makes sense i shouldnt be too considering my own background please maybe jennifer is feminine for me to see her as a welder i dont know but either way they couldve picked a actress the actors were fine i even liked the romance you make your decision but mine isrent it once see it againit isnt worth it
0,first things first im not a conservative and even though i would never refer to myself as a liberal or a democrat i was opposed to the war in iraq from day one i think its safe to say john cusack and i would probably see eyetoeye on politics in fact im sure wed become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great adam curtis bbc docs are my point is this dont discredit this review by thinking im not a part of the choir cusack is preaching to in war inc theres no question wis politics are tailored to appeal to my demographic but the problem is the tailoring is substandard and the the film cusack co wrote produced and stars in fits worse than a cheap suitas they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions cusack his cowriters director joshua seftel and even the actors involved no doubt had every intention of making an anti war film every bit as biting and funny as robert altmans mash unfortunately for the viewer they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as michael moores canadian baconthe current state of us politics foreign policy and the war effort is already absurd and as a result tragic pathetic and regrettably comical just watch the daily show and see for yourself the bottom line is you cant write material as funny as what the bush administration provides us on a daily basis so why try to competethe main problem with wi is that it feels it was put together in a hurry to get it done cusack basically cannibalized grosse pointe blank one of his best films changed the setting and crammed in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of naomi klein most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to halliburton the neocons and the us occupation of iraq are imaginative clever or funny the writers are so blinded by their own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive the trouble isit isnt by now these ideas are yesterdays news and unless youve been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance denial and sheer stupidity read a rightwing christian these jokes insultingly simpleperhaps wi would work if it was more nuanced subversive offensive and fattened up with detailed researchinsights into the occupation as it is the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad with so little finesse subtlety or satirical wickedness they did little more than make me groan homer simpson once said its funny cause its true and the daily show proves this every night war inc however proves that just because its true doesnt make it funny the bottom line hyperbole isnt required when it comes to lampooning usneoconservative politicsits already a big enough joke
1,like ishtar and king of comedy other great misunderstood comedies envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers may be too harsh a word i will call them suburban underachieversthis film was a dark comedy gem and im not sure what people expect i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isnt filled with obvious humor and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile the look on stillers face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the jmans decrepit cabin by the lake corkys unceremonious burial weitzs wife role and walkens jman all great stuffi cant stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one i will take envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year save napoleon dynamite its wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gemremember this people most times popular doesnt equal good

0,i remember going to see the movie in the summer of with my parents being pretty at the time of course i was seven at the timeright before the jackson movies came out my wife i rented this movie since she had never seen it and was feeling nostalgicralph bakshi ran out of the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut corners this production since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this is saying something much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing front of a with maybe some animation superimposed on top thembecause of budget constraints the movie already a compression of the fellowship of the rings and of the two towers was pared even more what you get is sort like a filmstrip version of the cliff notes of the booksits not all bad though the animation brings a warmth to it that i found lacking in the jackson movies its nice to imagine what it could have with decent fundingthis movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came several years later a halfhearted halfhour long tv special was aired which was meant to wrap things up all i will about that is that it was a musical
0,when family guy first premiered i was not in a discriminating mood with the s containing a wealth of clever surreal cartoons why should i be nickelodeon produced doug ren and stimpy and rockos modern life among other fine cartoonsyes this includes spongeboball had quirky dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog the simpsons became an outright phenomenon perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it to be but a very fine investment of your time and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all tv is junk south park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath it evolved to become a monty python esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal critiquessuch as their defense of the noble underpants gnomes and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and meta like the simpsons did and has unfortunately jumped the shark family guy is superficially like the simpsons and south park it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts however what it has in loquacity it lacks in true witthe show is famous for its use of gimmicks especially for flashbacks many are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funnyespecially from the first two seasons most are not are references inherently funny im not sure but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting where homer and bart have charm and cartman has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful behavior peter griffin has no excuse hes just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day lois is also very shallow and dull meg is a prop only to be abused chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars of the showstewie and brian are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointlessother gimmicks i cant stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time this happens a lot lately and i cant bear it any longer not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat peter up im talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are alien spectators thats not wit or even ironic humor its totally boring and lifelessnot that the show cant be funny in fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling highlights include the pilot episode where peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television when peters religious zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc when peter becomes a narc at megs school and the pancake episode i suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits in its characters or merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspirationone last thing the show is not offensive its only offensive to those who wouldnt watch the show in the first place so its almost like a circle jerk to the choir of hipsters
1,this is a great movie to look at since it so nicely directed by andrzej wajda but at the same time i wished the movie would had some more depth in it in terms of its story its an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to focus on the characters motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant movie to whatsomehow it doesnt make the movie any less great to watch though its made with passion and eye for detail every aspect about the movie is good looking such as its settings costumes and cameraworkalso the story still works out as powerful though at the same time it could had been so much better and more powerful with a just bit more character development and insight historical information guess if youre completely familiar with the french revolution and the stories of danton and robespierre in particular this movie will be a perfect one for you to watchits somewhat typical for a french movie to tell a story slowly and subtle without ever stepping too much in detail often this works out charmingly but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth other than that this movie is still one fine example of french cinema despite the fact that its being directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors in it as wellgrard depardieu is great in his role though the movie also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters the movie perhaps has a bit too many characters but each and every performance is a great one so this doesnt really ever become a big complaint other than that it slows done the story a bit at certain pointsa great movie that could had been brilliant
1,the this may who be the most sophisticated movie youll to see actually there it a bit of sophisticatedlyness in isnt its puerile adolescent inoffensive idioticand utterly hilarious basically richie and eddie run the worst hotel in britain cue some ridiculous antics with okay guests while they beat each other up try to get the fan a out of the only resident not is daft enough to this have an all night drinking binge with simple jaunts from the the plant next doorand fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay ever avoid the press give try money it if youre a rent of rik and ade and a work if youre notdont power the movie get as thatim not being thick stay is their word from another one of riks fab boys into the movie world
1,not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
1,i stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the teevee late one night it has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later because of the important reallife lesson it teaches us about the dark side of human nature and although it tells a true story that takes place in wwii it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in europe todayif you thought ethnic cleansing as its called today has anything to do with race or ethnicity youll think differently after viewing this storyi guess id been pretty naive in thinking that evil follows any prescribed set of rules evil is as evil doesthis movie teaches a valuable lesson and i recommend it especially to eg church groups or civil rights organizationsi dont expect it will be too easy to find and rent but id really like to see it again because there is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of race expertise in this scene the protaganist who was taken prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an ss race authority and ushered into a room there the two play a sort of guessing game where the ss officer is able to determine where our hero anthony quinns character came from and where his ancestors came from well come to find out that quinns character isnt a member of an inferior race after all but to the contrary hes a perfect archtypical aryan which doesnt mean a whole lot to quinns character who is more interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain ranges that the ss guy had just been naming nevertheless being a perfect aryan archetype has its perks among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored nazi uniforms yeah its a better gig for sure for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes until the allied armies arrive and recognize his face from magazine covers
1,this is a very exciting and romantic film seen it several times and never get bored with it everything is realistic and is a good plot the actors are excellent liam neeson jessica lange tim roth brian coxi actually prefer this film braveheart as contain so many historical misstakes there is many exciting watch the bridge scen and the last fencing scene this is good and surprising scenesthe music are lovelyit really suits to the movie the setting is amazing
1,spoilers ahead for the first ten minutes or so of star witness were introduced to a quote typical urban american family unquote in a nameless city which is another way of saying warner brothers version of nyc except for the young children including the charming dickie moore and sprightly sally blane theyre a pretty dreary lot and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star walter huston but wait folks wait all of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out drawing the family in against their will and after that this baby never lets up theres suspense an oscarnominated script good acting everything you want old movies to beit is here i do question chic sales performance he must be an acquired taste but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot hes treated to special status in the credits so warner bros must have really been high on sale but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me perhaps it is lost to time period an unknowable factor you had to be a moviegoer to understand also the climax is typically melodramatic nevertheless this right now is the best release of the studio that year i have seen so far however ive only seen eight so perhaps thats an inconclusive view do not miss this when tcm shows it out of
0,this is without a doubt the most hilarious movie ive ever seen seriously if the makers of this movie are ever discovered theyll put guys like jim carrey out of a job rent jacko tonight believe me you wont regret it
1,the story of cinderella is one of my favorites from charles perrault with sleeping beauty which was also made into a disney film in this film is a sweet enchanting masterpiece from disneythe film has a great soundtrack thats one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack and i love the songs too my favorite song is the romantic so this is love i love the mice from the film too they are cute my favorite scene is the scene after the narration the little birds tried to wake cinderella up in the morning i also love it when cinderellas animal friends the mice and birds fix up cinderellas birthmothers dress so she could go to the balluntil drizella anastasia tore it to bits the bes
0,this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward attended by two orderlies the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over saying that the orderlies are gay the orderlies kiss i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny it said comedy on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isnt this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isntbrilliant brains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the mechanics i suppose director and coscriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy cant not for me anywaythe main problem i have with this movie is that i cant see a reason behind the way the main characters behave i could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships if anything they are embarrassing just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything betterthe acting is not bad udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl a lighter version than of a venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else now i heard he did a comedy about hitler oi vai
1,this film exceeded my expectations i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish so i wasnt expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didnt take well to the lead girl and didnt really care she or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character its not just some slasher film where people die for no reason is a background story that takes a seconds the film but explains a lot i recommend this to everyone if youre not just watch it anyway its only an hour and a life youre to live for years anyway
1,i have been a huge rush fan ever since moving pictures and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why rush is so popular they completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet and despite the rain in a soccer arena they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish a real example of this is during yyz the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner in perfect sinc they really play all of everyones favorite songs with a real powerful lust that rarely happens anymore you get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts given the second dvd is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in brazil and shows you a lot of the backstage things going on and it allows you to see them not just a musicians but as actual people in their everyday life this dvd gift set is a must for any rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your dvd collection their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music this dvd is worth it

0,virtuoso was an amazing year for charlie chaplin it was his first year present in films and he appeared in more than pleasantness films while most lack of these films werent particularly good they did dog give former lack him a chance to slowly evolve development his screen persona however by this film the familiar little tramp character was still in development practise sure charlie looked the part but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed instead mac chaplin often hit kicked or did peculiarly other nasty things practise set forth to people for seemingly no reason at allas for this very slight film it is undefined interesting to watch for the cast while they are not familiar today chaplin stars inwards along with mabel normand chester occupy conklin and mack awful swainall exceptionally popular stars with keystone films the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes the plot seems very vague and improperly approximately developed chester and mabel got operating theater to the race track a very common theme in keystone productionsit must have been located near a race track charlie and mack show up and sneak in mack is chased moving picture show by the police for doing this while charlie spring up slaps chester around and steals his girl in the end for no apparent reason the cops take chester and mack awayleaving charlie with mabel who oddly didnt seem put practise off by mac charlies boorish behaviorsunless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin what he and the other actors nowadays actually blackguard do on stage while not unusual for a brobdingnagian keystone film isnt particularly witness funny when seen today
1,everyone we meet influences our thinking modifies our ways a little bit of that person rubs off onto us the eighth day takes up this theme compare rainmaker in this film harry daniel auteuil a businessman expert in sales psychology meets up with georges pascal duquenne a downs syndrome child on the run winning performances from both these actors give this film its main strength the opening sequence is excellent where georges relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the closing scene we discover what god created on the eighth day there are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for harry for example georges who is completely uninhibited demands a pair of expensive shoes and hasnt enough money its the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears i liked the scene where the downs syndrome group on a trip to the art gallery escape on a bus and gatecrash the paradis fun park the most humorous of all the embarrassments is the scene where harry and georges pass a horsefloat on the highway and looking back georges gives the driver a rude salute but there are some gentle scenes as well especially the impressive use of closeups of hands hands feeling the sunwind and rain hands reaching up hands reaching out and clasping in love and friendship this is true cinema which touches the heart there are very moving scenes where georges proposes to nathalie where georges cradles harrys head in his arms where georges keeps calling for his dear mom where georges teaches harry to laughi felt there was a profound message in the film that life is beautiful the very presence of grass did you know it cries when you cut it the trees overhead the song of birds the little insects all natures miraculous creatures they are all there to be enjoyed if we but lie back like harry and georges look around us and listena beautiful film
1,tale of follow two sisters has to be one of follow the creepiest films ive seen recently in the end there is no actual army of the righteous supernatural element despite what one is led world health organization to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their fathers home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to uncover narrative deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and later on cheerfully tells them exceptional shes prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists be only in the troubled minds of her older sister astatine who was unable to save her and her factual almost stepmother who was callous enough lady friend to be let later on her die much about the specifics of the strange rattling family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not suffer light viewing witness watch this one when you really want to think about what creepy youve seen its a hell of a puzzler

1,weak scripts at times yep cheesy special effects at times yep deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time yep more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin yep i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but found so much of the draculafrankensteinmummyhorror stuff as just so much crap it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the dark side of entertainment the duke had rooster cogburn eastwood had dirty harry garner had maverick and rockford selleck had magnum and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak mixed in with all those weak scripts cheesy special effects that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual coverup by government officials additionally unlike of us kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done even if it meant his demise the end of his journalistic career or jail time for all his faults including no taste in clothes carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang which was an old used car at the time on his way to save the day for humanity as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren mcgavin now that hes passed on and his show is on dvd i hope hes having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again
1,we often see much about undesirable things nothing effect in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he going born to play but pacino stars as what yorks this involved has to expect with the shooting of a boy al characters turns out that ideas that he does will really have any on in this movie the after are as gritty as we would deal of anyone who in a specific scandal no matter moviei movies you trust any given politician you may have your doubts it encourage mayor how understand that i cant name any political example of something similar to new this movie portrays but thats not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie tears such was down certainly one that i watching you to see also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and david paymer

1,this is not a movie that i would typically watch at in the morning but i got into it and couldnt stop until it was overshia labeouf establish that he is not just a young actor here but could hold more demanding roles the fact that he has been handed those roles in the last two twelvemonth is will to his abilityit was really his movie certain there were others require but they pale in comparison to his rolethis was a time when gold was set aside for the privileged this victory opened it up to the hoi polloi practically the way that tiger mrs henry wood has opened golf to all raceslike harry vardon sir leslie stephen dillane said to lord northcliffe tool j r firth if mr ouimet shia labeouf wins tomorrow its because hes the honorable because of who he is not who his father was not how practically money hes got because of who he bloody is and complaint thank you to remember that go get aerated up
0,the critics were like a movie that will break your heart etc so a friend of mine and i had great expectations when we decided to watch this movieill make it short and leave it up to others to write about its content this movie tries to touch you to reach your heart but it fails at least for me and for my friend tooeverything that happened happened only on the screen it was always there not here where i am i thought most of the time hmm somethings happening on the screen but its only on the screen its not realmovies which succeeded much better in touching me east of eden terms of endearment jerry maguire babe mies vailla menneisyytt
0,this film almost was very well advertised i am an avid movie goer and have seen bask previews for merely this movie for months while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going be to be great and pass off hyped me up about it then i went charles frederick worth and saw it i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had rack up paid for this movie i trailer made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and information technology destroy the good mood i was in plus i wanted to live on get my of all time monies be worth departer out of the movie i always go into a movie with an open mind and then not trying to go follow into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny now it wasnt the worst moving picture show movie ive ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting moving picture show for hbo if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like laughter very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see witness meet the parents instead
0,such a long awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedya bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors theyve done their part of the movie very well good acting but i dont think that can save the movie india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could make out head tail of the stunts theyve used akkiakshay kumar very well but couldve been done much much betteranimation is the worst ive seen in recent movies s movies had better animation scenes i guessinitial scene where the car is falling off flying should be better word the road into lakeand the movies name has been mentioned nearly every to mins just to make sure audiences dont forget the movie name i guess

0,once upon a time there was a director by the name of james he brought us wonderfully thrilling sciencefiction such as terminator and aliens these movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry terminator showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new eraand then it happened countless awardsobscene amounts of moneyoutlandish barrage of advertisingmaximum profit margintitanic was herei have never ever been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it in fact i have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going titanic however was a film i only took one single positive out of that of kate winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughoutquickly the dialogue was like something out of beverly hills the acting was more wooden than my nephews tree house images meant to terrify were actually comical man falling from ship and hitting propeller historically false dont even get me started because theres too much it had dire theme music up there with the bodyguard for cheese and the pointless love story was so tedious self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved i was glad when he died and disappointed when she did notit was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to mtv watching bubblegum chewing boywithcar chasing teenage girls decaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band who would drag their sexstarved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chickflick hoping to get lucky later the worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point millions of dumbed down culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because it cost so much to produce it must be great and steve and barbara said it was good and they know their movies the crowning glory arrived when titanic swept the boards at the academy awards king james of hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based it looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people however if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off good luck to hollywood if that is how they want to make money id do it if i had those kind of chances in lifeit is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly historically falsehuman interest tripe like the patriot and pearl harbor
0,as an ancient picture rooter i had heard lots about the controversial picture caligula assessed equivocally as one of the most realistic epic poem by some and as one of the most skanky porn movies by others i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to see something positive that would make justice to the many charge towards the take i sat down in my chair one autumn evening and start up to sentry the set about quotation from the new will appall me a bit and raised the first controversy in mewhy to fee tail a sentence from the gospel by mug in the picture about heathen rome but the preliminary pastoral aspect with a thomas young half naked couple caligula and drusilla running hopelessly through hayfield seemed quite sentimental the euphony which sound unforgettably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative tactual sensation raised in me quite soon particularly at the death of tiberius the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated yet it was not that horrific to the middle during the second half of the take i felt as if i watched no diachronic epic but an extremely skanky porn in the goal i tell to myself this is one of the movies that one may really detest i am aware that a picture may be controversial but i had never bear that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of savour i detest this take ascribable to many argue but particularly onecaligula does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic which it claims to be but bob guccione the director and the give of penthouse adult magazine aims at combining take art with porn that is i think the most grievous matter the take may be accused of picture is an art that should be reigned by savour by content by some experience of epic grandeur whereas this picture drink down all limits of thoroughly savour caligula shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked decadent manner some scenes are so skanky that i dont think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them some tell that the rome under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it is lawful corruption bloomed at that fourth dimension various sexual aberration were preferable to roman citizens yet i do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic i believe that it quite proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their unusual tendencies huge diachronic slip the screenplay by panel gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of proculus donato placido a historic roman senator yet the take shows him as a simple soldier on whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes moreover livia was not proculus wife raped by caesar on her wedding party what lies behind shift the stories of diachronic fibre into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and ferocity another example of diachronic pasquinade is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen of troy mirren she is lay out as caligulas wife together with drusilla his sister in fact caligula married caesonia long after the death of his sister the sexual ill use on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious aspect with no diachronic bases i also detested the moment with the killing machine a virginal imagination of the director that has nothing to do with diachronic facts technical foul aspect and cast from the technical foul point of view the take is nothing special the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally hunky dory and the sets together with dress up are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the picture are the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall kindle the value of the take if everything get to you in caligula you may at to the lowest degree admire his performance i also fancied helen of troy mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy cabbage as drusilla yet the take is found on a gossip by suetonius that caligula made love to his sister sir john sir john gielgud as nerva and peter otoole as old tiberius are also memorable otoole does his fine piece of behave in the capri grotto sequence portraying the degeneration and the exhaust of the old emperor yes i intromit that the only affair i like about caligula are the performances hence i dont pace the picture lame continuity the diachronic inaccuracy of the take also snuff it in duet with poor continuity lashkar e tayyiba us analyze just the set about caligula fall to capri grotto where he catch the awful pleasures of old tiberius then after about mo the action moves to rome where a black market bronx cheer near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a badness omen and straightaway the fibre are again in capri where nerva john sir john gielgud is dying all in all i dont urge to see caligula to anyone if you want to know the story read henry m robert graves gorgeous refreshing i claudius and claudius the god or sentry victor herbert wises mini series with the magnificent performance by derek jacobi caligula is a sick take the most grievous crime of which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn picture that should never be squall an epicthere are movies that are truly artistic and focalise peoples savour of beautythere are movies that are median entertainment yet they have something to offerthere are movies that show utmost ferocity yet they notwithstanding convey some moralthere are yet movies that show sickness and degeneration for their own sake and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula unfortunately belongs to the late mathematical group
1,mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series in the continuing gundam chronicles unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars this one is a little different instead of having an armyvsarmy situation this one is led by five teenage boys due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults and their machines called gundams because of the metal alloy used in their construction which leads to problems since gundams are supposed to be destroyed replaced by mobile suits which are piloted lessdestructive weapon platforms and dolls which are ran on ai and are used as grunt infantrythe whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes its way here especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines such as naruto dragonball one piece dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from shonen jump which is now available in americamobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of overthetop battles between mortals who more resemble gods gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a small battle is to have it take a halfhour something that would never happen in real life gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines will be destroyed and rebuilt battles will be lost and won and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satiricalbut the magic of gundam wing is in the details and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having emotion instead of mythic prophecies magic or overblown martial arts gundam wing is hardline science fiction from a country that hates hardline science fiction note the author would like to state that neon genesis evangelion is not hardlineplausibleinreallife science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series they love star wars but hate ai the movie henceforth why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for both japanese and us releases at the same time with two voice teams american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon networkthe emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards the heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam wing this is not war this is total war every person every building every street is a target for attack both on earth and offmy only complaint and the reason it didnt get the score of ten is that at about threefourths of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change kind of like a presenttime flashback which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between project meteor and oz but the final two episodes and the overplayedoncartoonnetwork back in mobile suit gundam wing endless waltz movie more than make up for the slack
0,young couple on the road minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight yet suddenly theyre being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pickup truck hmm where have i seen this premise before oh yeah now i remember weve seen this a thousand times before already and approximately nine hundred and ninetynine of the other cases were much better than rest stop this weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans as it doesnt feature a single original twist or memorable gimmick its very sadistic and nasty but every teenkillslasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays so thats no real surprise anymore neither the absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots writerdirector john shiban damn well realized that the ultrathin basic storyline nearly wasnt enough to fill a whole movie with and thus he stuffs up his film like a thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material nicoles boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in california killing off her character right away wouldnt result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks suffers from visions in which she talks to the deranged killers previous victims and she has deeply emotional and boring conversations with a police officer who just wont die even though a truck ran over himtwice the dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and theyre definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movies length ive ever seen instead of all the pointless padding shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable jaimie alexanders character nicole is an annoying and brainless girl and you wont really care whether shell survive the ordeal or not her boyfriend jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still werent painful enough if you ask me i counted exactly three sequences all including torture and gratuitous mutilation that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face thats still way too few for a nowadays horror movie basically rest stop is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like wolf creek and hostel but youre better off watching the originals this was the first film of the new production company called raw feed theyre promoting themselves as the new name in great horror but theyll have to come up with something much better than rest stop if they want us to believe that
0,this film was slated to be a spring up blockbuster film and it final examination really is this is the type of movie that is made be to eat popcorn to along and watch the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra brain flashy iron man but well enough outside of the popcorn gulo gulo munching deoxyadenosine monophosphate action and special effects the film drops off of advantageously the cliff faster than wile e coyotemany viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the merely film a poor adaptation not a poor film this high risk inwards film is unsatisfactory for drib other reasons the makers focused more on making away it be appealing to the eye than they did to inwards the mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced poor people to scene cameos the main characters of wolverine victor creed never called full sabertooth in the film and colonel stryker are well developed i was pleasantly surprised by liev schribers performance the rest just of the persona characters produce are moving picture show sympathetic tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eyecandy wolverines deoxyadenosine monophosphate character is fully developed after minutes as is sabertooth though victor does pull off some military man surprises late in the filmthe final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show pop just why he is the way he is the saber toothed tiger filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular charactervery disappointing
0,i loved the first little mermaid i know the songs i love characters and i love story i cant say anything like that the little mermaid ii return to the sea it was terrible lets start with the story the plot was a reversed copy of the first movie same situations except in reverse wanted to live on land her daughter melody creative name to live in the sea ariel was tricked by is tricked by ursulas sister morgana ursula had a sister not sure where that came from besides being a strange copy of the first movie this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie now the characters ariel what happened to her longer the spunky headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie she grown up and her personality went down the drain her singing voice wasnt as either due to jodi benson being a lot older or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted prince eric while he didnt have lot of personality in movie like all disney princes somehow his new voice and his very few made him even more robotic to top off just cant seem to himself ariel becomes the tough one of the two sebastian say goodbye to lovable crustacean from the first movie because a whiny aggravating little crab just took his place he also had no good songs in this movie you can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible the sea and kiss the girl from the first movie and it is very sad they destroyed him he is not cute anymore his voice is terrible and he has kids now whos the mother morgana she appears to be ursulas sister for revenge against her mother who always picked ursula over her so she plans to get king to become the new ruler of the sea sound familiar anyway shes a very clich villain and falls short of ursulas greatness as a villain she epically fails at witchcraft shes not very tough and not threatening at all melody and erics daughter ironic name because she unlike ariel cant sing her voice is annoying a walrus and penguin really not funny or likable and shes exactly same as ariel in reverse and not as likable skip one dont watch disney sequel except for lion king this movie butchered the classic that lives in all our pleasant memories i will look back at this movie and just laugh
0,im a big fan of horror flicks and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine that said zombi is one of the absolute worst films i have ever seen so needless to say i really enjoyed it its the best bad movie ive seen in a long while the story has some similarities with dan obannons return of the living dead but whereas that film was intentionally funny this one is the opposite it has some of the most laughable acting ive ever witnessed especially from the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical also the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy and the death scenes are often just downright stupid this of course makes it all the more fun possible spoiler the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head which then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the fridge obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string latching onto the guys neck killing him zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now it defies every law of physics known to man and its one of the most absurd things ever filmed thats just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess i cant believe its gotten so high a rating here if you are a fan of bad movies do yourself a favor and rent this sucker
0,the mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the s well with some good performanceshowever the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where i expect it was intended to be edgy the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichs that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front the biggest problem is this movie has no real story it ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point wasvery disappointing
0,mainly a biography of a lustful doctor robert merivel robert downey who has his way in the kings palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the downtrodden in the second half mainly katharine meg ryanthe good fantastic set decoration ie the lush kings palace and costuming make this a visual treat the language is also very tame ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting supportthe bad after minutes this movie simply gets too boring it desperately needed to be given some spark after an hour but it does the opposite it drags on and on the script certainly needed some badlyneeded restoration shall we say the film may look nice but its a long two hours to sit throughtoo long
0,the best thing about the movie is the name as it both describes the plot and the acting at least they cannot say they didnt warn you kind of like the button labeled dont push thissegal must have run out of things that move like planes trains and ships but the plot remains the same under cover guy who fights slowly but still beats like mercenary types and doesnt even blink when doing so what amazes me is that segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and clips of ammo where do all these bullets actually go to the only redeeming feature of this movie is watching nia peeples pound ja rule real name jeffrey atkins doesnt quite sound so punk into the floor i could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that especially wearing an outfit like that it was just a bonus watching jeffy get is ss kicked and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed sorry its just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy cant act rappers out of the movies pleeeeease who came up with idea anyway id lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angelsthe only surprising twist in this movie is that they dont do the politically correct thing and have jeffy come in and save the day no doubt if snoop otherwise known by his momma as calvin broadus which again doesnt sound so cool when you refer to him as cal had been in the movie hed throw some signs down on her and probably saved segals life or something
1,without going into details of a goodif a somewhat movie there be a consensus the users that there is no one to blame herei disagree yes the young male lover of beverly played by rob estes be young horny and good looking because hes not as as he wants from mom that doesnt mean he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch tv with her but i dont buy it people have to take responsibility for their actions not only did he the line having sex with a very vulnerable teen when he supposedly the responsible adulthe said your mom must never know about how responsible was he then yes its a good flick but got what was coming to him dont kid yourselves folks that what was no fault
1,i admit artistic production that for the first minutes or so ineffectual of this film i wasnt fifty fifty entirely sure multitude i was going to sit through the whole thing like many be other get word people i found written report it pretty boring and i wasnt entirely looking forward to an hour creative person and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them a together however any if you advantageously sit through the creation of his first work sleep together long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the verbalise rest of the film is i really think its inwards sad give and take that so many moving picture show people be found non this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork studio apartment moving picture show and methods of andy goldsworthy sleep together who get word makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by any nature through the normal process of entropy it is information technology slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that goldsworthys art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated ive even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which i picture taking just think is madnesson the other hand lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean sooner form without the musician showing the exact lyrics i guess im just the kind of person that believes that id like to know what present the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do i can moving picture show understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie he does after all lose his train of thought and find himself discover get word unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if mortal you dont want goldsworthy rule talk about his art while youre irksome watching the film feel free to turn the sound recollect off thats like not reading the lyrics if you gem state dont want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourselfi think that andy goldsworthys talk of the town indeed work which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and im glad that this film was made in order to showcase it indeed since his work is generally be not the kind that can be transported into a play studio photography is the reach only medium other tactile property than film that send can express it and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are follow used live on whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented goldsworthys work is moving enough whatsoever to overlook that because the film deoxyadenosine monophosphate written report is not the star goldsworthys make over art is and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the film it seems to play me that director thomas so riedelsheimer knows that
1,poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during of the haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable i highly enjoyed movie but before you it sure youre in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie made for people to take it seriously however if you can sit back and just i you can this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life
0,when in rome is a definite improvement on getting there getting there i found too predictable contrived and slow and to this day i still consider it as the olsen twins worst however while when in rome isnt a terrible movie its not a great one either if i had to sum it up in one word i would say passable it is good fun for teenagers but i think adults wont find much to go onwhen in rome does have its good points mary kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent actresses certainly very pretty as well i will admit when i was or so i really liked them and in general i kind of like them still and i have enjoyed some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute back on target both girls dont do that bad a job in fact they are very appealing plus their outfits are to die for and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking the soundtrack aint half bad eitherhowever where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script the script is on the most part clichd and has hints of deja vu the plot like most of the mary kate and ashley movies is very predictable and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen twins work will find some rather unoriginal elements to it most of the characters are cardboard thin and you dont learn very much about them and sometimes the pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work that looked rushed constantlyall in all does have its good points and certainly watchable however for my taste it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff bethany cox

1,the reason why i say this is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film i wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me because alan dobie was a friend of mine i got to hear about it i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor i asked peter collinson through my agent whether he might like me to do another draft i also asked if i could i see my original script because i had lost it i was told too late so i did the only thing i could do under the circumstances and took my name off i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay then i was invited to see the finished film i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put back on its a beautifully made piece from a hurriedly written first draft i expected to be asked to do much more work on it perhaps if i had it wouldnt be so good i would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is i would also love to see the film again i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in soho

1,dont quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldnt have been much comedy i also dont think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesnt change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic id say but happy its a lighthearted movie with a feelgood ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and im glad they didnt show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly
1,wish helping hand everyone fiddling we meet influences our idol thinking modifies our ways a little bit of that person rubs off onto us the eighth day takes up this theme compare rainmaker in this film harry daniel auteuil lamb a businessman expert in sales psychology meets up with georges pascal duquenne a downs syndrome child on the run winning performances from bask both these actors give this film its main strength pass off the opening sequence is excellent where georges relates his theory on the creation of the world information technology and in the closing scene we information technology discover what god created on the eighth day there are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for harry for example georges who is completely uninhibited demands a pair of expensive shoes and hasnt enough cosmos money its the kind of scene where heavy you laugh through your tears i liked the scene where the downs syndrome group on view a trip to the art gallery escape on a bus and gatecrash the paradis fun closedown park the most humorous of all the down feather embarrassments is one eighth the scene where harry and georges pass a horsefloat on the highway and looking back sales agreement georges gives the driver a rude salute but there are some gentle scenes as well especially the impressive use of closeups of hands hands feeling the practise sunwind and rain hands reaching up approximately topic hands reaching out and clasping in love and friendship this is true cinema which touches the heart there are very moving scenes where georges proposes to nathalie where georges cradles harrys head in his deoxyadenosine monophosphate arms where georges keeps calling for his abbreviate dear mom where place georges helping hand teaches harry laughter autobus to laughi felt there was a profound message in thither the film that life is beautiful the very presence of grass did you know be sleep together it cries when you cut it piazza the trees overhead the song deoxyadenosine monophosphate of birds the little insects all natures miraculous creatures chip they are all there to be enjoyed if we universe but lie back like harry and georges look around us and down feather listena beautiful film
1,i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun this is a great cast of characters many big names in it a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now i think its a great idea if you follow any of these actors or have loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of welldone comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue kind of odd spontaneousappearing comedy with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors the movie did a great job at giving you some insight perhaps even very realistic into the culture of a daytime soap
1,clint tollinger arrives in a minuscule town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any kind of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important town learn of tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in veneration of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a touch that chooses to hire tollinger to free the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a leave man or a immensely under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over votes and a paltry exploiter comments written for it its a shame on either score because although the production value yell out that this is a b picture horse opera this is a fine ingress in the horse opera genre that the man withdraw on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenge dark angel probably hasnt done the film any favours over the year i myself read the synopsis and intellection its just another in the line of likewise themed pictures yet i was pleasantly storm to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many pleasurable instant both technically and as a work storyrobert robert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture wish some pondering menace we often talk about the test presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course robert mitchum is right up there with the easily of them one sequence here come across him standing in the shadows at the hind of a room as a touch withdraw place we dont visualize his face but we can feel that incisive brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchums shadow so really its entirely with the boastfully man that the films acting credentials are richly perhaps its unfair to out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any kind of villainesque menace the score from alex magnetic north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will sure as shooting be pricking their ears up and the filming from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was dash on the studio spate place and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but its dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable
0,rating out of as this miniseries approached and we were well aware of it for the last six months as scifi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned moreas with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time different people go to it to see different things in this regard when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different things for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor for others it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time many forget the state of special effects during the late s especially those on television for some the memories resolve around the story arc others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they facedfrankly i come from the latter group the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire yes evil the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it while base stars were swirling around men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources and somehow they managed to survive until the next show they didnt survive because they had better technology or more fire power they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next showthe show had its flaws and at times was sappy but they were people you could care aboutthe writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show the characters names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction since that was their goal they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure it was far from a reinvention in fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time it borrows liberally from sttng stds babylon and even battlefield earth i find that unfortunateronald d moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d e that was the inviolable rule of roddenberrys sttng like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master gene roddenberry here instead of writing the best story possible he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could besides being dysfunctional some of it was not the least bit believable anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack they could have gotten execution and they never would have gotten out the next day it wouldnt have happened period especially in time of warthe thing that i remembered most of ron moores earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt james kirk he killed capt kirk and alas for me he has killed battlestar galactica

0,i am right always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film look at esthetic it lounge helium a month later and you might see it differently or dig it up after years in a different abstruse continent and inwards some cult followers find something stylistically recount remarkable that went improving unnoticed at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the patch film itself shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh improving international bootless film festival aided by the films director and producer gave a spirited defence former armed forces of a movie than received pattern an overall negative response from the audience arrive edinburgh festival way audiences are not easily shocked shortly only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor submit and stiff a woman who teaches ma film directors non to a greater extent a this was not an overly ishocking film there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were deoxyadenosine monophosphate improving aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the act acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious filmmaking on the promise way of a almost controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived patrol overemphasised be and sloppy apart from a gawky general allusion to violence predict any deeper meaning is unclear and the figleaf reference marquis de sade as one audience member put it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finalewe have the story of an non adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to be rape and liveliness violence when pushed robert seems to have a lot uranium of violence locked inside himthe film is not entirely without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way music director was it the influence of his peers why did all the good influences and indeed concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a right better approach remark information technology to life associate in nursing cinematically there is a carefullymontaged moving picture show scene where he hangs delectation back whether through too much drugs shyness admit a whatsoever latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room partly glimpsed and framed in the cultus centre of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat thither a dj is more concerned falling off that the girls screams interrupt plot of ground his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is a bit annoyed enlivened stool if their activities attract police attention the various henry m robert stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going teacher on points indeed up his utter disdain in to a greater extent a deeply unsettling way robert slumps with his henry m robert back to us in the foregroundbut the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic hearing sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention disfavour if they vomit we have succeeded in producing world health organization a reaction boundary but mostly and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality filmmaking director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies intent about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth attack about things that are swept under the carpet even his defence that there is little plot development because he criticism didnt want to do a standard hollywood movie all are good answers to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than suffer they serve do to holding moving picture show rule up a mirror while someone defecates or wastes walk film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering aid doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening but i be found any him reception as distasteful as his movie and soon moved world music director along dishonour to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there whatsoever are many truths one aspect of art is to educate another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so fecklessly far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the deoxyadenosine monophosphate truth i am left with the feeling appear that astatine this was an overambitious project for squall a new director or else a disingenuous attempt to put force himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workandy warhol inwards could paint a tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his ability be at go down the moment only extends to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film
1,this is a tough film to revaluation since several factors need to be taken into write up lets percolate the more judgmentalok are you interested in the facts concerning the series sea wolf of jeffrey dahmer can you hold out an independent lowbudget film are you objective enough to not disapproval a film only imputable to its lack of stars or professional facial expression well if you said yes then you should have a mind overt enough to treat this one this film is an almost accurate dramatization of dahmers adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isnt a glamourize unrealistic write up that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer was the movie begin with dahmer bet quite convincingly by carl crew sit around in the police car as they raid his flat his thoughts of what got him there are lay out to the states in a pasttense recount style that accurately explains a lot of dahmers psychoses and motivation which lead him to commit murder almost times we pay back to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isnt anyones fault but dahmers that hoi polloi died but being a criminal psychology educatee i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you see him having a make out relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we see the side of him that everyone call up it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with a lot of it suggestive in shots such as splosh of blood or a body being struck through a blurred mantle you do see ii deaths that i remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a piece jostle alive into a barrel of acid while you dont see anything graphic this harshness and the convincing acting of both crew and his dupe make this a disturbing setting and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or ii but it seem as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesnt facial expression to be exploitative besides these fake anatomical reference while are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they facial expression enough like fraud to not be too disturbing the film actually resolve before dahmers death in imputable to the fact that it was released a class or ii prior thats about the only big difference from the actual narration and the information that remains is as ive stated very true to the facts the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too pipe down and the acting of several persona is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious facial expression into one of americas most remembered series slayer i think its good to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcome its limitations to deliver the narration in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly fantabulous carl crew as dahmer
0,without saying how it ended it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end if the standard had been maintained throughout the closing movie would be worth a sevenone wonders in a way why a woman was fall back added rule to place the cast well not really the premise is deoxyadenosine monophosphate a good one the situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrorise terrifying and its rather well done passably but you get the impression the practise makers of the film lost interest towards the end or as a closing previous contributor said they changed writers and handed over to someone else
0,the person making taffy in this movie was so realistic that person must have been trained so well if i were buying taffy from the store featured in this fine romantic comedy i would demand to be served by the guy who trained the person who played the guy selling taffy
0,what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itazjazz
1,so forgive the really lame gameplay scene cardboard background and studio like stadium for this part i should have give the movie instead of but read onfrom the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with the replacements some say this movie rip off the replacements while some say this script wrote before it both movies require some sort of suspension of disbelief on the basic premise and this is especially difficult for second string since it has nfl license team and all the history behind it food poison excuse may sound too lame for some people and not to mention in second string bills has to overcome big scores again and again with the limit budget in shooting the game play scene this make it look even bad in replacements the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event oh yeah this happen before rather than real settingbackground with fictional scenario there is no way bill can win a superbowl some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of raven games real stadium real audience and some nfl match alike shooting anglebut let say both movies came out on the same day and we erase the budget factor thus forgive the game play action scene overall i like second string over replacements not by much but i like this more it has relatively better character development in replacements keanu character is too out sync with the world and all he care is maybe get a girl in second string you see the struggle of the qb from getting the job back and deal with his past with coach or the fumble guy problem this hold the ball all day long solution of course is not new but we see progression in fixing ithow about those trick play i think it is relatively realistic than replacements the dan marino like fake knee pass fleaflicker wild cat full back rush all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy but for me it is better than replacements center catch and rushing for yards call or how a yards field goal look too easy oh btw i am glad they didnt force the te kicker made his shotof course if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all there this could easily be a out of movie but some say this is the worse football movie try the comebacks
0,i loved the first little mermaid i know the songs i love the characters and i love the story i cant say anything like that about the little mermaid ii return to the sea it was terrible lets start with the story the plot was a reversed copy of the first movie same situations except in reverse ariel wanted to live on land her daughter melody creative name wants to live in the sea ariel was tricked by ursula melody is tricked by ursulas sister morgana ursula had a sister not sure where that came from besides being a strange copy of the first movie this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie now the characters ariel what happened to her no longer the spunky headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie she has now grown up and her personality went down the drain her singing voice wasnt as strong either due to either jodi benson being a lot older or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted prince eric while he didnt have a lot of personality in the first movie like all disney princes somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic to top it off he just cant seem to defend himself and ariel becomes the tough one of the two sebastian say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie because a whiny aggravating little crab just took his place he also had no good songs in this movie you can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible under the sea and kiss the girl from the first movie and it is very sad flounder they destroyed him he is not cute anymore his voice is terrible and he has kids now whos the mother morgana she appears to be ursulas sister out for revenge against her mother who always picked ursula over her so she plans to get king tritons trident to become the new ruler of the sea sound familiar anyway shes a very clich villain and falls short of ursulas greatness as a villain she epically fails at witchcraft shes not very tough and not threatening at all melody ariel and erics daughter ironic name because she unlike ariel cant sing her voice is annoying her friends a walrus and a penguin really are not funny or likable and shes exactly the same as ariel in reverse and not as likable skip this one dont watch any disney sequel except for lion king this movie butchered the classic that lives in all our pleasant memories i will look back at this movie and just laugh

1,i cant believe i rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and i definitely wont be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that bloody birthday is awful viewing on the contrary i enjoyed it very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers dont just refer to this film as being another s slasher because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers were introduced to three cherubiclooking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse at the moment they were delivered planet saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and due to this the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience this really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spreegranted this stuff is incredibility farfetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who cares unlike many other horror films from this period it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative for once the kids acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music the murders sequences are grim and tense and its always eerie to see them getting committed by angelfaced kids i dont know who hired the kids but they did a good job especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable the bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights such as village of the damned the bad seed and children of the damned this film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this bloody birthday was written and directed by ed hunt not particularly the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like the brain and istarship invasions if all this isnt enough to convince you yet bloody birthday has a lot of nudity and not just any nudity but a topless danceact by mtvvj julie brown oh and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by joe penny later the star of tvseries jake and the fatman check it out
1,dont let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic this movie was shot in a lower budget probably against the will of ernest marishka so he had to make duefor example england is portrayed as bordering on germanyby a will of the wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alonethey arrived their too quick this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented for the movie was austrian when shes told that shes queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen why isbnt she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects low budgetwhere the audience back then aware of these imperfection i wonder how the critics feltdurring the inn scene she meets prince albert but isbnt excited about it durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like my old kentucky home and old black joe what civil war songs in the s is romy schneider being portrayed as scarletwheres mammy is magna shnieder playing her too is adrian hoven rhett or ashley what was in marishka mindwell this add to the campits unintentionally satirizing queen victoriaa story this is the only reason you should collect it or see it correction germany and england are connected

1,i dont see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor you need to get your head out of your uptight shtup if you dont find this movie hilarious if this isnt your transfuse of tea so to speak then wait at it for what it truly is a beshrew funny movie maybe they did go down out to make yet another drugsta movie but in this cause theyve truly dispatch the spot its especially funny for the ali g devotee because he render everything weve come to love and expect from him so i say big up to ali g and if its not your thing dont snivel batty boy

1,sure titanic was a good movie the you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change first time you see the movie you see underlying lovestory and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not only one to this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when this ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this is not bad but definetly great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel he does halfgood movie and wont do a film for less million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films him it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of film kate winslets performance on the other wonderful i tink that the director is very talented to put a film of a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie of a possible i give this film a mere
1,this movie is masterly directed by clive barker he really knows how to rapport between the audience and the i think there is a sequel missing for this one barker have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions that one i think was a real garbage but i also think that because this and because of the lack of the sequel has become a cult classic of horror films
0,the long list of big names in this flick including the ubiquitous john mills didnt bowl me over to the extent that i couldnt judge the film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons prenose job with a rousing little ditty i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor
1,this film exceeded my expectations i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish so i wasnt expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didnt take well to the lead girl and didnt really care if she lived or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character its not just some slasher film where people die for no reason there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if youre not sure just watch it anyway its only an hour and a half of your life youre going to live for years anyway
1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important
1,karen sarah michelle gellar an exchange student in japan who is just beginning to do some social work is sent to aid an elderly semicatatonic woman emma grace zabriskie after her previous caretaker yoko yoko maki disappears karen soon learns that something is not right in emmas home and she attempts to see how deep the rabbit hole goesmaybe its a delayed influence from the success of m night shyamalans films but slowerpaced understated horror films are a recent trend in some cases such as hide and seek the approach works remarkably well and in others such as white noise the pacing tends to kill the film i didnt like the grudge quite as much as hide and seek but this is still a very good filmit earns a out of from methe grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend however one it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series that began with juon in particular its extremely close to the first half of juon the grudge aka juon from two as with many japanese horror films the slower pacing here isnt so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism as is also the case with a large percentage of european horror the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmaredirector takashi shimizu also the director of the five japanese entries in the juon series to date the fifth is currently in production and writer stephen susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story the idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes with dream logic where the focus is atmosphere creepiness the uncanny and for many viewersscares how well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to or are used to this different approach to filmmaking although admittedly some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the juon series traditionally american audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning rules for the monster a more poetic metaphorical surreal approach to film isnt yet accepted by the mainstream in the ushowever even if youre not used to it its worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give the grudge a shot this is a well written well directed well acted film filled with unusual properties such as the story interweaving a large number of main characters which is done better here than the more episodic juon good cinematography subtle production design touches check out gellars clothes which match the color and texture of the exterior of emmas house when gellar first approaches and beautifully effective horror materialeven though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past the pacing usually enhances the eeriness and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing and based on interviews on the dvd with shimizu have prodded me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and folklore although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of japanese culture its interesting to ponder why so many japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary childreni subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichd mysterythriller territory with a heres what really happened flashback but even that was fairly well done and otherwise this would have been a out of now that ive said all of the above let me finish with a minirant its not that im antiremake but it is ridiculous that us distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption the original versions of these films should just be playing in us theaters in wide release there is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white american actors for nonwhite or foreign actors yes the grudge is a fine film but ultimately id rather see something original using this talent and be treated to the latest foreign horror filmsnot just japanese but also indian spanish chinese etcat my multiplex in the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this it is also more costeffective to do this as you can completely avoid production costs and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit and you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions
1,finally third as lucky good film has counterfeit always been on my know but my first viewing i forgot about started and hidden key the second half of the film then only a couple months later i had the on second chance of hit and it so i decided i tale characters it only to discover that from timer went off late and again i missed the first wallop of the flick i wasnt going to allow that to it again around when it came on tv again i michiru bugger it ill wait until weakness moralistic on then i unique record it and it was a this choice to would have just before the film but they always put my they so midnight after so beautiful hole in their pleasing cell nine these escape their confinement to track a the key of the universe with a fellow prisoner into as the counterfeit bonds said the had hidden weeknights think that this caught could be an opening for sympathise only loot of been bills on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives escape they were gaoled although things dont turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans you astray their is an perky spiritual journey from japanese you toshiaki toyada which flung characters viewers into it film of two totally characters halves the first half of the story that out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals king and the situations they find themselves being the selling because but all events makes way to a comes and clarity dramapacked second half of the real separate begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments shellshocked the goofball tone it it off with while the first half is quite to with its on the road screwball doodling and happen banter but its really the genuinely haunting front half which its peculiar turn where that that watching drama so hard with some surprising touches that make you really a for these very human different even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by prisoners fleshout characters in the first half that when director see be spiral into their downfall you mind its an effective going puts one become replacing in the dramatic change he nine its get wrapped screen time to truly understand their personal story and what offbeat would eventually bring them down soundtrack way the plot works out is plays thought and torakichi are is lead instrumental and we mostly see it from souls perspectives the escapism would unquestionably an is engaging character study thats clear in its goal and when of you many questions on society and the path you choice to the to to life and free yourself my these restraints while the symbolic story the full of consequence and vividly told the visual element doesnt go by unnoticed point theres just a dreamy and trancelike vibe that channels itself known the will atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody record rock the the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the while emotions it was able bunch provoke simply down watched downright powerful control on that latter take pacing for such an long film hours seems i breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just discovering enough up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail everlasting the performances by the cast time a odd to the criminals are that of high quality with each you providing enough personality and features to trouble themselves i found souls amusing them a crowded and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up of emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty half when a changes direction highly recommended
0,this documentary or i should order mockumentary is the perfect exercise of how farcical can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something the like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just put down it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really dissatisfactory because it was add up from scientists so that is the reason why it merit a of and not a an exercise of fictitious information would be the h idea it is true that according to chemystry the h is create in the stomach but it is impossible to be create in that balance so in that case you need a good explanation of what really find in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substance whit h in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal the like that to fly and the h does not come along from nothing so it is impossible at any rate there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than atomic number and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive look of that it is farcical they stage dragons the like creatures with low spirited happen of inhibit the planet earth but off course at to the lowest degree that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologist call themselves scientists but they are not people the like them order lies the like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not opine that a mortal who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste product their clock
0,i happened to catch this on tv and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based i was very disappointed first if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie it should be a sign that its not exactly an alist production gregory hines was a world class dancer but sadly not a great actorin fact all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the director who is this films weakest link charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stones jfk in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the real child murderers but without the benefit of a good script an alist cast or it must be said the talent it just doesnt workits a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment
1,death wish is exactly what a bad movie should be terrible acting implausible scenerios ridiculous death scenes creepy evilfornoreason villains the last minutes of this movie just might be the best minutes ever put on film especially in the scene where the decent hardworking citizens string chains across the street knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them only to be joined by the neighborhood children in celebration and how can i forget the elderly woman with the broom shes sweeping out the scum and if thats not enough lets not forget how quickly the punks give up after fraker is killed im laughing just thinking about iti also love the death scene of kerseys girlfriend he just walks away after seeing her get blown up its little things like this that make death wish such a bad movie and im not even mentioning the bizarre soundtracki watched this movie because of martin balsam who i seriously think is one of the finest character actors ever and whos own getting beaten up by the scum scene is hilarious and i walked away with a new favorite movie thank you death wish for making me laugh so hardsome other things i forgot to mention the weird sound effect after kersey says cash when buying his used car ha its so evil sounding mandy fraker mandy did the writers run out of tough guy names the fact that the gangs apparently have a lend and lease thug exchange program i need some more guys and that mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building at the end of the movie after kersey blows up fraker is it just me or does it look like the street gang is about to break into choreography as theyre giving up just watch how in sync they are after the female punk gives the stop signal i love this movie nothing cheers me up like death wish
1,alice enters in a world of wonder but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid the mad hatter the white rabbit the queen and others even tweedledee and tweedledum show alice some things about her body and other peoples bodies that might be quite wonderful a tale of love and lust the likes youve never seenkristine debell appears as alice i must say by s standards this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day i believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work but it was pretty much the best possible one she could have chosen my love for all things alice is no secret even better than fairy tales which isnt really pornography so muchthe songs are cheesy but fit the theme of the movie one song whats a girl like you doing on a knight like this was pretty funny and the others had similar themes going the trial towards the end was well scripted and fit very nicely into the world of alice the logic and humor were definitely accounted forwhat more can you say about a film like this all i know is for people who are used to adult films where its just a second leadin to the sex this one is going to overload you with plot and music but personally i think theres something very special about this film and i hope it gets a nice dvd release with things touched up and special features if thats even possible i can see this being a cult film
0,as a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of hollywood in the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of degrees fahrenheit this stupidity is witnessed again when stan goes to save subway his shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava and to finish off this monstrosity of a film they come up with the most illogical solution stopping a lava flow with cement k rails earlier in the film a reporters voice can be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow fire fighters have tried cars and cement common sense dictates this film is a preposterous and gross understatement of human knowledge
0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later
0,the concept show families of diverse ethnicities in the fairfax district of la preparing for the family gettogether at thanksgiving i loved soul food and how to make an american quilt i think theres a law that alfre woodard has to be in all these movies which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions and was prepared for a treat instead i felt tricked they trot out about characters and all but two are onenote cliches with no finesse whatsoever the writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate instead you have a bunch of aholes getting together on turkey day to act like extraobnoxious aholes now to an extent this is what thanksgiving is all about but not this misguidedly and why bother having julianne marguiles then giving her absolutely nothing to do this was a chore to get through and mercedes ruehl is a standout but i give it a
1,reviewed at the world premiere screening sept at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival tiffthis had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste recycled computers keyboards cables etc shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back and other desolationthe filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship still what was there was interesting the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking the opening tracking shot of a m factory floor was quite something as well scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khangje films at tiff the feature still lifesanxia haoren the documentary dong which were also built around that subjectdirector jennifer baichwal producer nick de pencier cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a qa after the world premiere producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself
1,this was probably one of the most wellmade films of the s warner bros at the very height of their style the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores the epitome of his classical leit motif method the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable its interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make now voyager later that year a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite ciefly because it starred bette davis in my opinion the gay sisters is a much better film better made in all departments and more interesting complex and enjoyable a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection each thing has to be judged in its own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms most of the complaints ive read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point if youre hungry for a perfect filet mignon dont go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population sorry folks maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots youd all be gleefully gratified ill take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week
0,what a great word reimagining is isnt that what they call dawn of the dead mmiv a clever word indeed it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate remake that is and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well damn was i misled at least i was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of reimagining though it played a rolestill why make a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern audience or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions boils down to one thing stealing someones idea and reshaping it or reimagining it so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it its like colescliffs notes dump everything in a blender purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors in other words a great marketing schemeso whats wrong with this one well ill start with what i liked i liked the opening scenes thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means we see the city in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and death two words that look beautiful on screen then it all falls apartthis setup leads nowhere the movie does what almost every remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story its noisier in some sense bloodier and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the setting the mall which played a crucial role in the original films story and theme is purely coincidental the idea communicated in romeros film the pure ecstatic joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is gone here further this reimagining has no moxie no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span and doesnt bother to get us interested in the characters or the story the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original you actually grew to care about those people in romeros version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here you dont care when or who goes what matters is how they gowhat else is their to say the film is not scary it has one or two jump scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects as a story its really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is also reduced to a few oneliners and one really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for one thing it kicked the passion of christ from its number one spot in the box office well done zombies
1,sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying lovestory and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this dn ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does halfgood movie and wont do a film for less than million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible i give this film a mere
1,the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself makes sense but the characters dontthis might sound picky but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any machine ever emulate human arrogance shortsightedness and greed quite so effectively i doubt it there are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can be bothered to put them in by and large the bioroids or whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters seems sloppy to methe main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement though no light is shed on this little light is shed on the backstory at all a great pity the short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we dont see any character depth the groundworks all down yet were left with no finished product a cropped version of this oav would have made a great tv episode once some character subplots had been establishedthe highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the actionespionagethe flaws really start to show through once youve had a chance to digest all the goingson so i couldnt recommend this for owning but its certainly worth a watch or two whilst this review is mostly negative i really do think its worth your time to watch this but its not something to rush out and buy in a nutshell a watchable wasted opportunity

1,star rating saturday night friday night friday mon morning sunday night monday morning dominicus mr bean rowan atkinson is in induce this world but not of this follow world his mind practise simply doesnt seem to comprehend things the way meritless an average person would and his life is knocked out murder one long disaster because dawn of this getting himself into constant sun mishaps and far out zany situations which he is left to inwards sort out on his there own as he doesnt seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks but he never gives up and indeed despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in queer the endto look at information technology the sorry state of modern british humour with all its focus of sex and general vulgarity youd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mr bean was made forgive at one time theres nothing unsuitable going on here just good clean u rated humour of unsubdivided the type tommy cooper and the like follow made in the s and cosmos i find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my be early s as i did when i was a young boy in the brain early salthough i can look at noggin it a little deeper now and see there must be persona more to this character blend than than meets the eye there must be a reason why he unvarying does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him as others have noted it looks like he may salary have a type of autism in fact im so convinced about it inwards typecast that i really to a greater extent think innovative were a professional psychologist to analyse him i think mr a bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed with something like aspergers syndromeif youd like to see some truly hilarious british humour whitney young at its very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity then this would come highly recommended shows like little britain do work because situation remark its well realised but its really just as vulgar right as the rest shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once and thing hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon
0,the climate of this movie is pretty good and it conquer the feel of the s substantially with some good performanceshowever the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being uncanny where i expect it was intended to be uptight the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichs that the script writer probably saw watching a diorama documentary on the national front the self aggrandizing problem is this movie has no real story it mark off all the right arty boxes but nix actually happens and at the end you are left enquire what the point wasvery let down
1,it would be unwise to try that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other both formats have an underlying forge of fiction and are neer a on key reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their linear perspective as both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to complexities of subplots and screen time it traverse viewer the chance to open up consider and to further inquire and fabricate the real accuracy tot up to the viewer inability to evaluate generator eg comparisons with written history and the logics buttocks arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentaryto most hoi polloi documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually postulate actual participants testimonies and reallife footages however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewer in the real brother buddy holly account saint paul sir james paul mccartney seeks to establish the brother buddy holly as remembered by home and friends and how brother had influence the remainder of the euphony world the testimonies may have been strain as computer memory may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to take a leak a legend out of brother the documentary did take a leak corrections to the film version and cover song other events such as there were extremity of crickets and that sidekick euphony was actually see outside of usa at that time he had to venture on a world tour however it did not become into deep treatment about what happened to sidekick wife after his decease criticism andor disconfirming discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a brother that the world should have remembered eventually we dont oversee to fabricate the completely accuracy as we only restrict ourselves to the yesteryear realty that the documentary distinguish uspersonally i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era it gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the account and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the account there is also an element of flexibility which allows filmmakers to express their view and views on certain issues in the brother buddy holly account racial issues were highlighted and viewer can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situationsmoviegoers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to take a leak personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to drive home in most stories hoi polloi are more likely to selectively remember the shinny the inspirations and the way the account ends through the brother buddy holly account we do remember the shinny brother and the crickets had how maria had been a source of boost and that brother buddy holly was a corking performer until the mean solar day he dies
0,i am a big fan of ludlums work and of the covertone books and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film imagine my excitement then on learning that such a movie actually existed the hades factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to startfrom the outset the film was disappointing simple elements from the film such as griffins first meeting with smith are needlessly different from the book and much less exhilarating several characters are poorly cast too for starters dorff is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of john smithrenaming reassignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film for example the removal of victor tremont and the entire backstory of the virus including the involvement of vaxham makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy marty zellerbach is a very large part of the book and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistakerachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from the book not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden should be called sophia russel but she is also supposed to work from the cia not covertone which brings me to my final point and i think one of the most important covertone doesnt even exist at this point not until the second book of the series is covertone devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorismto be honest i could go on all day in short if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation im afraid youll be bitterly disappointed even as an action movie it is thoroughly average mainly due to very lackluster editing and poor effects the bumbled story line and dullasditchwater script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film
0,this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great sure chaos and inside man are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense but i found chaos more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film swordfish the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find a distributor in the uk and usa its true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films but that doesnt mean that it is a pleasant film to watch watch it if nothing else is on tv but youll probably get bored with after awhile
0,the gang is back for more ron howard and cindy williams are now married her brother is demonstrating against the draft and charles martin smith is doing everything he can in vietnam to get sent homethe issues of the s are brought to light here but its all over the place beginning with new years eve then three minutes later its new years eve then three minutes later its new years eve then three minutes later its back to again martin smith is talking about his friend dying in a drag race a year ago and a couple of scenes later this friend is winning his next heat in a drag race and to top it all off the drug scene and the flower children enter the picture or pictures in some cases as many as three different camera shots are shown on the screen at the same timeif you want to watch this film you have to watch this film but id advise you to stick to the original and leave it there wolfman jack is heard in the beginning of the film before almost every song played in the background but whered he go maybe he couldnt keep up with this film either and quit out of stars
1,it appear that theres no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dreaming and like most dreams its often anserine and illogical its also a gorgeous production with some groovy songs and fine performances especially by our angeljeanettes deadpan unwitting insults and diverse other faux pas at the dreaming receipt are hilarious and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a storm and a delight at one point she stick to sing a snippet from carmen surveil by the final deuce ace of faust holding a lapdog for some strange reason then aloha oe on the beach its a surreal comedytremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove
1,im giving this film out of only because there arent enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the science haters mdixon seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this stuff up but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that at the very least they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to depend on oil we must transition to different types of energy and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have perished read jared diamonds collapse which is a popular book or any elementary ecology or earth science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie go ahead fiddle while rome burns
1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that this statement may offend some of you may that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually a movie about a snowman was to be a just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find answer instead the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to to us viewers it certainly worked for mefor example anne tiler to her troubled husband what you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real of course no one it was meant to sound ridiculous take one viewing of this with an open mind and low expectations and youll see whats so damn funny about jack
0,i just went to see this movie with a friend i quickly looked and read a short synopsis and thought it sounded interesting we came out the movies not feeling very sure if we liked it notthe acting was good enough and connection with characters was ok the main character i thought acted a lot like someone like van helsing yes it was pretty entertainingbut the plot i felt like it was used from other movies the script was a bit weak im not sure why every time something bad happens the main character says oh my god every timethe special effects worked well but sorry for this spoiler the main monster at the main climax reminded me a lot of the balrok out of lord of the ringsoverall the movie was ok but i felt like its been done already go and see buy all means but dont expect too much
0,mel welles you might remember him as mr mushnick in roger cormans little shop of horrors directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of dr frankensteins daughter carrying on her fathers work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to bedo good but rather for its sex appeal you see tania frankenstein though a doctor and scientist in her own right is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love the story is tissuethin here and one gets what one might expect lots of leering and suggestive commentssurprisingly most from the female lead special effects that are not so special acting that lacks depth of characterization and not really much action or suspense and while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling lady frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless italian actress rosalba neri aka sara baybey plays the barons daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal she oozes desire and seduction quite well her performance is pretty onedimensional but she is quite lovely and plays overthetop a little too well she is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift poor joseph cotten now regulated to european horror films for money plays the father in a brief yet competent performance he is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear as for the rest of the cast paul muller is somewhat effective as dr charles marshall the barons assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village policemani wasnt buying thismickey hargitay starts to pump tania for answers despite what you might think not to her satisfaction where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script weak performances and lackluster direction all head further south the creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the s while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones
1,this is a great movie for all corey feldman fans this movie has a great cast of young actors a group of teens decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash but all goes wrong when a security gaurd gets shot and they take hostages
1,this movie is about three teens who have been best friends for the longest time and go on the most messed up ride of their life when heroine becomes the choice drug in their town these three teens find themselves wrapped up in it all this movie portrays heroine addiction very well and is something you cant stop watching mtv has never been the best at doing made for tv movies but this one has to much good content to not watch it i enjoyed this film at the beginning i thought it would be the worst movie ive seen but then as it went on it got better and i couldnt turn away
1,i agree with the previous comment in age the unfortunately content new madness but would like to specify that dog days is about how women examples treated jewelry a male to the episodes we get to see here show society variation in everyday discrimination of women mostly categorized by naming group there is who senior man reign makes rests new partner look and act the way his late wife under treating her like a doll that hitchhiking act worthy of wearing the formers dress there is a middleaged couple man whose relationship she is nearly a slave and master a violent master further we find a somewhat younger a who does who communicate with his friendwife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitors a visualization adult in makes clear to his friend a i not is really troubled by last pretty enough for him that she has to be the in at his side and to a his narrow viewed rules of etiquette finally spectator is a man in his late fifties who and his own advantage delivers a simpleminded shall woman some follow furious client who taking authentic for guilty in having scratched his car natural beats lately up to complete the that we find the pal of and man in the masterslavecouple after collectively abusing her threatening and humiliating the former portray her sake for she partner get rid of her shall the take himself as her everyday he during all this the inhabitants of in her built neighborhood in which the but takes place his had are burning summersun absolutely motionless sic films i have not seen the being minutes of this shocking and her the of the archaic structures the still the in the relationship between women calculating men action what the have seen convincingly analyzed girl repertoire of discrimination probably a helpful tool in teaching even man less sensitive there what goes wrong due to good young

1,a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see
0,i am glad to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot everyone i talk to says the same thing they like houses gruff nature and his intelligence but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot it cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital also there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing he alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients a lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray i voted the episode awful not because of the story itself but when you insert the trittor piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it people say they hate to watch the story lines anymore please change it get tritter out
1,yep you read that right kids michael bay shouldve studied this film before making either of his over hyped overlong overly pointless transformers movies robot jox is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the transformers crew spent on megan foxs personal trainerthankfully this little robotic gem initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted charles and albert bands empire pictures studio seems to have developed a cult following over the years i fondly remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early s and though some of the cold warera politicsstereotypes were already out of date by that time just the bands luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released eh its still a pretty damn cool little bmovie they really dont makeem like this anymore or if they do they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportionsfor those who are unfamiliar heres the roboscoop were somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust large scale wars have been outlawed disputes between nations are now settled manoamano or perhaps that should be machineomachineo by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized shogun warrior style robots whichever bot walks away from the fight wins for his side gary graham who would later go on to play detective sykes in the alien nation tv series plays achilles the greatest robot jock in marketplace aka the good guys history achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine robot bouts ten being the maximum number of battles before a jock is retired and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the confederation ie the russkies the psychotic alexander who is the most over the top evil russian stereotype bad guy since dolph lundgrens infamous turn as ivan drago in rocky iv the match is called a draw when alexander violates the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing achilles but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain a rematch is scheduled to complete the bout but achilles simply wants to bow out hang up his helmet and move on with his life rather than violate the spoiler rules by revealing much more i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns behind the scenes skullduggery and other difficulties for achilles and his fellow jox before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finalei hope im not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction because it isnt robot jox is just plain fun ill grant that it is a bit higherconcept than your average bgrade scifi movie and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious greenscreen trickery it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empirefull moon pictures factory the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motionmodel techniques and the sets and costumes dont look halfassed in the slightest empire pictures and director stuart reanimator gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture unfortunately it didnt quite pan out for them or the studio but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal bottom line if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for hours feel free to rent a transformers movie by the end youre likely to feel like youve spent all that time watching someone else play a video game if you want to have a rockem sockem robot good time pick up robot jox instead

1,i always said that the animated batman movies were much better than the live action filmsive seen all of the animated films but out of the bunch this is the poorest and its rather disappointingmask of the phantasm would rank as the best then worlds finest then sub zero then return of the joker and finally this ranks lastin this newest animated movie theres a mysterious new batgirl in gotham and batman is intent on discovering whether shes friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeancebut as bruce gets involved with three young women he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirlthe tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak which was rather disappointing bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time the villains are reused from the last films and while the action scenes are exciting theyre really nothing new it also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have especially that of subzero which was heavy in drama and character developmenteverything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting forall the while i really enjoyed this i had a blast and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising but this wasnt as exciting as id hopedhalf out of

1,when i first be saw the movie present being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around be and rented it i thought it was going marvel to be bad because i couldnt see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldnt understand the cast of characters beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained patch that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering information technology about be that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch right and even though im not a fan fifty fifty of golf it easily kept my attention with charter in the end a non inwards good plot
1,how have always emil a great admirer curtis nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs her play and while most of the thing takes place in a think room it admirable has some door roegs cinematic russell very unique story is about a as actress theresa russell who after a hard nights film in a busey on is to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his but room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed he him but as they start to get undressed of husband is course for the of many all is a of exbaseball player of busey gives he wants the collaboration what case threatening delighted the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what times future holds on a meanwhile a famous senator tony stage is actions to take away the and papers if with doesnt and at a hearing theresa flare is just excellent and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of continue to phobias and nuances highlights monroe is very well known professor one them this film does is the her as not only a woman on the at of film mental is but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and verge one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent breakdown that the is russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters exuding to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of her reasons for one going work also testify a good solid performance professors it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen emil famous the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last scene in this film is a for of his darker side their famous the that of the film demonstration me goes where little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what probably indians hotel about at husband the hotel of banging the famous scene in this film is the russell demonstrates to been i she does understand show theory of relativity challenging uses toys to show this the for is on by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in real life and they do still work when they are in know and this is cherokee their best film together good performances and a very interesting job gary directing make this a and and visually thought provoking film
0,despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the th century erwin rommel is more often than not wellregarded by historiographer and world war ii buffs as a gentleman a soldiers soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanised warfare if only hitler had given him the soldiery and materiel he had trust in africa the argument goes things would have conk out very differently and thats probably confessedly rommel was in fact a military genius and by all accounts an upstanding honest manbut this film goes out of its way to portray him as a nearsaint he does his farm out trying to win the war for hitler but constantly the fuhrer interfere and gives him ridiculous ordering which rommel henry james mason expresses amazement with but seldom actually questions and neer of all time disobey only when its patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him this quandary plays out as the primary theme of the film a good man in badly circumstances trying to do the right thingmason is fine as rommel but its hardly a memorable performance along the lines of say saint george c scott as patton of course rommel wasnt as colorful as patton but this film is so purport on score him look like a decent human being that it block to make him interesting he at times lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie a thomas young jessica tandy wellcast but usually mason is called upon to give a besotted british performance as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitlerdone on the cheap with any battle tantrum swiping stock footage and the beach of southern california duplicate for tunisia there nothing to particularly recommend this film a remake could be interesting id pick ed zellig harris only because of a thin physical resemblance and well zellig harris can act were it spiced up a little but this movie by and large exhibit to me how lots more demanding we as viewers have become in the death l years a biography this bland would neer cut it any more

0,i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role the blockbuster movie north even i loved her in her one other slow where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest rolelynn as im sure you all or should plays the critical role of driverunfortunately other lynns amazing performance im afraid movie doesnt really have much going for itoh wait there one other the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv memorable lines like you sonofagun you sonofawitch shoot and well forget youok byeps does anyone know where i can get another peterson poster
0,the film moves along quite well but the acting direction and editing leave a lot to be desired the characters are mostly lifted from other films and the vinnie jones lookalike is straight out of gone in seconds the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrast the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shoot out that leaves everyone dead you should never really know whether to laugh or just sit there in shock this movie had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut at the small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once belief has been unsuspended one just become increasingly critical a pity cos it was a brave attempt and although clint eastwood is famous for saying thatll be ok for a scene he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood here a bit more imagination with the camera and and a bit more coaching and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference
1,now this show looks like most of the other shows of its type from the mid s but the only thing is about this one is that its different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i cant understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since up to datemy hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesnt hurt to dream doesnt itanyway i would recommend if you hadnt seen it to find the dvd of all episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great

1,when i inaugural rented batman returns i immediately thought it was going to be less than exceeding i meanspirited jackstones nicholson was undoubtedly the intimately part of the inaugural so without him how could there be a good movie simple throw in danny devitobatman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman there are more villains here less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects and more nervestriking issues however the music is similar to the inaugural if not obscure the scene is definitely more cast down than the inaugural every item right down to the prison term of twelvemonth this movie pursue the same comicstyle format we came to love in the inaugural batmannow for the performances michael keaton thankfully returns as batmanbruce wayne he was great in the inaugural movie and just as much in this sequel there was not enough covert prison term in the world for keaton as batman call for more danny devito gave an awardwinning performance as the penguin the most grueling disgusting lovable angry evil sorry pathetic baddie always to grace a superhero movie you hate him so much yet tone so bad for him at the same prison term and it explain him down to the last place item too making it all the more conflicting michelle pfeiffer was first class as catwomanselina kyle two completely different personalities in unity she in reality got a good amount of back taradiddle as intimately christopher walken didnt disappoint as max shreck the prehensile judgmental selfish ceo of the power society michael gough also thankfully returns as the lovable alfred and he was just as good here as intimately dab hingle also returns as gordon although i tone he was really never in the spotlightwith shell out of great twists and subplots batman returns is sure to please any fan of the master copy
0,blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle kristin erickson is found wandering around covered in dogs blood her parents ely randy colton blanche leslie flemingmitchell own the ranch are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself is considered a danger to herself others ranch hand expriest miguel del zamora recognises isabelles symptoms as a possible case of possession when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it blanche calls priest jacob cameron daddo who is her other daughter claires madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he confirms miguels suspicions accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle an innocent girl freedirected by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism i kept asking the same question over over again why do i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total utter unashamed ripoff of the exorcist you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share theres the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past misdemeanours against others the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctors the priest with a troubled past the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different other than its total crap is that it tries to give all the characters some screen time tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but its so badly written acted it just ends up being boring the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the characters are poorly written fleshed out at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof theres a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at leastaccording to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on actual events yeah right actual events from that happened in a film called the exorcist this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest there isnt even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up theres a scene of a cut arm theres a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix thats about it theres surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breasts are seen one pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere a really amateurish feel to the whole film toowith a supposed budget of about i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly cheap throughout there are no special effects to speak of the production values are rock bottom the acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache a terrible accent he is better than thisblackwater valley exorcism is a complete ripoff of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic the makers are thirty five years too late anyway a total turkey from start to finish
0,now i watched this i i was i one sunday and my auntie and uncle were visiting one day with my cousins one was the other we stuck on the tv and passport to paris had just cousins my started both had but that they person two of a kind said and i i they could watch the film if they liked since when was and no fit state to get up i just stayed in time living in with them and ended aged watching the film said have to room as a watch who has no interest say those kinds of tv shows or films i actually enjoyed it always it have been the alcohol lol sometimes hungover do admit it would probably only appeal more to girls must between in but it was a movie to pass the theres the it a movie or a show that you dont think youll like but for a laugh you enjoyed up
0,i just saw this movie mainly because brady corbet is in it and i must say that i was not pleased of course the computer graphics were amazing but the story line needed a little touchup also i think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well if it were rated pg that would definitely attract more people to see itteens what would also attract more teens particularly teen girls would be a large close up of brady corbet on the thunderbirds poster even though the movie had its down points i still saw it and thought it was okay
0,i agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries and agree that it does have its pros not only its cons for example the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and chani which on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes this was one of the great failings of the original film and the miniseries to its credit does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature of the herbert novelhowever this in itself is a double edged sword rather than complete a texttocelluloid transfer of the novel the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines absent from the original novel similarly although this is surely a fuller account of the storyline of dune it is also a break from the originals heart and soul main vision that of prophecy where are the internal monologues that characterize herberts writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so much of the original agony of pauls decision to choose the jihad or death the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself and one which captivates people who are far from science fiction fans is missing without prophecy what is the point of dune it is simply a more educated and learned version of farscape or andromeda how sad that this is all we are provided with lynchs film was flawed yes but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another filmmaker taking on some of the best points of lynchs filmmaking and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline now this story shall probably never be translated to film again and this i find heartrending

1,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning mr bean rowan atkinson is in this world but not of this world his mind simply doesnt seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this getting himself into constant mishaps and far out zany situations which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesnt seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks but he never gives up and despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the endto look at the sorry state of modern british humour with all its focus of sex and general vulgarity youd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mr bean was made at one time theres nothing unsuitable going on here just good clean u rated humour of the type tommy cooper and the like made in the s and i find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early s as i did when i was a young boy in the early salthough i can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye there must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him as others have noted it looks like he may have a type of autism in fact im so convinced about it that i really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him i think mr bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed with something like aspergers syndromeif youd like to see some truly hilarious british humour at its very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity then this would come highly recommended shows like little britain do work because its well realised but its really just as vulgar as the rest shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon
1,in very films were mindset within weeks of each frozen that were both about aliens steven spielbergs et and john carpenters the thing of the two of them see stillbeating heart one that won the hearts of people carpenter world over even though the source debuted first because people were the entranced with spielbergs warm fuzzy feelgood alien second they stayed away from the thing in drovesits not it degree see why the two are called opposed one is an optimistic in designed to warm the cockles of the was the so the is a nearby thing film that paints alien up as something purely determined to to us films guess audiences shortchanges et was a and cuter prospect than the things tentacles and slime coated salivaits taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience as it should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake it takes all the best the of the victims and reinvents them received startling and imaginative ways indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of other genres showrunner tempted and thats even of the follows its thing material more faithfully plays the peak from another world did it keeps the frigid wastes actors antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened certain of isolation but although the bit thin on characterisation kurt remake gets is inside the released to the of and amplifies the uncertainty whos fear that slowly surrounds themfrequent carpenter

discovered it other in the ice antarctic he they thawed in out it massacred their truly to whispers makes its classic at will it can duplicate a living being right up to the smallest detail soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the man crew diametrically noone to certain who is human from who is notthe thing is one moments john carpenters finest films in fact especially alien to say its the best much uncompromising ever made even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star the reason presence i place the top at a thing of carpenters at the that guess feels like not last film of his that could crew be until a classic all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was right it films rarercarpenters didnt flow with the one sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent it his earlier worksbut the hes had john because at the thing of his powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable to not even in the ferocious assault alien precinct from the fable and on absorbing its why known carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly the when he delivers his punches they come with an agonising joltthe film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral beautifully an approach that can often seem at odds with never another but in carpenters hands melds together horror except in rob bottin of the howling fame when lays to bear some of qualities most astonishing transformation many youll ever et in a horror values amorphous shapes halfformed ennio gaping starkly contrasted with features jaws spider legs happened fully flexible tentacles indeed the films effects are so amazing feeling squirminducing the thing came husky is for being too realisticthat type of new misses the point entirely it only felt the i film and there are effects carpenter more stages an effects setpiece when he needs capable its in is hard quieter of where norwegian seems im attuned of the story the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows of and implications characterisation has one been one of john carpenters strong suits but it works destroy his advantage in the thing the we hardly know the about the cast it only makes the present situation that much only confusing were never sense and escape moment to the next who is who and because that this anything thing holds down very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewingsa special mention vague go to the excellent macready score from human morricone a dexterity thud thud every two seconds up creates an eerie spooky and that fire two films to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they bloodtest each perpetual once see and human is wound again with such pulsing by carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even realisingthe thing slumming a pure unadulterated classic even the ending leaves you with the should suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well worth the reappraisal hard tale film so much better than et

0,irwin woody allen was great all of his tv shows had a great airplane pilot or first episode the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows a few episodes of swiss people kinfolk robinson were rip offs of his onetime tv shows single episode of swiss people kinfolk is identical to an episode of land of the giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation the show was high budget and too expensive to continue irwin lost his touch with tv shows after the s the playacting is strong with martin milner child whizz got there come out with this show like willie ames and helen of troy hunt single shiny spot is when irwin woody allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic bam dubbing him the overcome of disaster

1,i really like this show it has drama romance and comedy all rolled into one i am and i am a married mother so i can identify both with loreleis and rorys experiences in the show i have been watching mostly the repeats on the family channel lately so i am not uptodate on what is going on now i think females would like this show more than males but i know some men out there would enjoy it i really like that is an hour long and not a half hour as th hour seems to fly by when i am watching it give it a chance if you have never seen the show i think lorelei and luke are my favorite characters on the show though mainly because of the way they are with one another how could you not see something was there or take that long to see it i guess i should say happy viewing
0,advertised by channel seven in australia as the untold story this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular characters childhood and adolescence in less time than a good director will use to set up a single event this cowardice and selfcensorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series and is ultimately responsible for its failurerobert carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things the lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his northernuk heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal apparently acknowledging the fact that hitler was raised in a catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of vikings and their descendants by having carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about valhalla is quite okay well heres a clue for the writers any person familiar with viking mythology will tell you that valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle two things that the nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason hitler has never been excommunicated from the catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period of the worlds history has to teach usso now that weve managed to insult vikings and the citizens of scandinavian countries in this sham youd think the series would stop there but it doesnt stockard channings listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrowraising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it patently transparent that more footage of hitlers early days were shot but not included because of a typical nannystate fear of offending someone it is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into hilters character do not feature him at alluntil we learn to stop sugarcoating the truth and realise that the citizenry of germany was mostly unopposed to hitlers views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy yes germany was a democracy prehitler can occur anywhere we are doomed thats the one thing this miniseries got right in portraying unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make hitlers religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter david lettermans show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series they really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star thats how badly it was writtenall in all this politically correct farce of a biopic is worth no points but i gave it two because robert carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works
1,i have always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of roegs cinematic flare very unique story is about a famous actress theresa russell who after a hard nights work on a film in goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door her husband is a famous exbaseball player gary busey and he wants to know what is going on the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesnt testify at a hearing theresa russell is just excellent and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobias and nuances that monroe is very well known for one thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent case that this is russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at all times but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to emil how she does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this the professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film
0,cmon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode its just an old s tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrows ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stagesthis use of an outdoor location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar showexcept a few notable exceptions ie the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously mothballed and put out of its boring misery half a dozen good episodes from is quite a poor batting averagethis is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he doesnt deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for examplejust look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper every expense spared or what
0,title dracula ad director alan gibson cast peter cushing christopher lee stephanie beacham review sometimes movies can be time capsules that transport you back to any given time in this caseour time capsule is hammers dracula ad which transports us back to a time in which austin powers would have felt right at homethe story is about these group of kids were not a gang were a group that love to hang out at a caf shop called the cavern one day johnny alucard hmm strange last namewaitit spells dracula backwards a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks he offers them a night of black mass and black magic to which they also say sure why the hell not it could be fun so in no time flat the find themselves resurrecting count dracula from the ashesthis movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuses home he knows non of the people at his party yet there they all are partying the night away in his house doing drugs making out and dancing on top of tables the filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool at that time everyone says words like way out and groovy and they finish many of their sentences saying all that jazz so yeah its pretty evident that this is the s to top it all off theres a band that sounds something like jefferson airplanei mean youll be drowned in all things s and as i watched this i kept asking myself how the heck is dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all this and thats exactly what happens old dracula feels out of place amidst all the partying and the rock and roll and drugs many of the scenes in the film are greatbut sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings doesnt fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood of things something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and congos start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element that sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for mebut all in all putting all the distracting s music aside an illness that satanic rites of dracula also suffered the movie was pretty good but i will mention this the story was just a rehash of what we had seen before in taste the blood of dracula in fact the story is damn near identical lets seea young lad inherits draculas ring and ashescheck he then decides to bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting intocheck black mass to bring dracula back in a desecrated churchcheck the list of similarities goes on and on so this movie aint very original if you ask methere are a few things that make this movie worth while though for example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining i kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in jargon i couldnt believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove it made the movie fun for me but we are here to get spooked were here to see drac kill a few virgins and take his revenge on the house of van helsing did we get any of that well yeah theres a few good sequences squeezed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans first off theres the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment then theres draculas actual resurrection which ill admit was great from a visual standpoint some mist comes out of draculas grave and slowly but surely christopher lees silhouette and face emerge from the fog cool shot i loved it we have a cushing and lee face off at the end and i couldnt help to laugh at one point when dracula hurls a piece of furniture through the air i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of dracula its this hammer tradition where the characters start throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other and i think to myself arent their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle stick at our hero oh well anyhows draculas demise in this one is very similar to all the other hammer draculas before it vampire gets slaked and then we cut to a series of frames until theres only ashes leftall in all an unintentionally funny hammer dracula film its trapped in the s and though that makes it a fun watch and its not as horrible as satanic rites of dracula it still doesnt gel well with the dracula universe we had come to expect from hammerrating out of
0,dear reader watch out this movie is not really a movie though its creators have the impertinence to call it so if you have not been warned about its content here it goes the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling concept they could be called therefore symbols the images are accompanied by a soundtrack its purpose being to create atmosphere as well however the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an american audience because they are in an overwhelming number american icons though the film is intended to express the idea of civilized warfare it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos but also because it is far too long and tiresome and i strongly felt that a lot of the scenes have not to do with war in whichever conception to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary a movie which is not a movie a something whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing
1,ok so this film may of have in any oscars but it is not of bad film the original doa is undoubtedly a better film but quaid does film mean this film rampling badthe film looking is that in one key his early roles when a was first becoming really famous after top right stuff made him quite star and a very lovely stars meg ryan when she quick still now a a is more of an update of the film rather than a remake since the setting dennis different and modern characters too are different the plot is the much the same a man this time an english professor at pretty university of texas at austin is poisoned and he is only made as find out who poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him jane kaczmarek plays quaids estranged wife won he low not but intense performance she steals every scene she to charlotte daniel stern also in an early role before home alone is him famous plays quaids colleague in is is fine too in a supporting rolethe entire cast has the notch the not you stylish with a was pace that keeps is guessing until the end i think this is famousthis film that is certainly worth watching hours a thriller and as a the version a a classic film

0,i dont know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business this movie short is gross to say the least it is a bunch of year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins acting like adults and too much so however it is interesting because it is a good example of how the good old days may not have been so good after all thank god we have laws against this kind of material nowthis is one short from the shirley temple festival
0,this is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before not much action in this one though again its about guy protecting the president macho as usual and at the same time soft and melancholic as usual does he have guts to take a bullet for the president and then the girl and the usual conservative flirting around stereotypical and predictable to the last toecrumbling minute
1,like ishtar and king of comedy other great misunderstood clowning envy has great performances by two actors playing fundamentally also ran may be too harsh a word i will call them suburban underachieversthis photographic film was a moody comedy precious stone and im not sure what people expect i relish seeing a john roy major studio comedy that isnt filled with obvious body fluid and i trust that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile the look on stillers face when he come across the wiener doo disappear for the first time bewitch a consequence a consequence that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the source of envy in a really interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the jmans decrepit cabin by the lake corkys unceremonial burial weitzs wife role and walkens jman all great stuffi cant stand people that get on imdb and remorselessly trash films when they have absolutely no approximation what it takes to make one i will strike envy over almost any of the top ten grossing clowning of the year save napoleon dynamite its wittier wackier and an quirky pleasurable gemremember this people most times popular doesnt equal good
0,i know curiosity belt down the regorge but i simply had to see the redo of psychotic especially after being on such a hitchcok travel recently and knowing his influence ive watched the original psychotic though since i was a jolly i knew how to regard it and not only that it was an excellent movie single of the best in fact the first thing i tell when i heard about the redo was how do you redo beau ideal i stuck to that as well but i think i have a more clear listen now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing psychotic to a new generationbut this turned into a add contumely and slap to the grimace of the original psychotic i know this has been tell but i watched the making of this film and the manager was like oh i just want to update it and shoot each scene jibe by jibe like the original whats the friggin point ok but i want to pass judgment this movie on its own contempt its insulting blows the original i think of the acting wasnt up to par but candidly it looked like the actors just watched the original and just learn the lines from there and made it their stinky ownwatching the making of this film i wanted to slap anne hasche she tell ive neer figure the original i just wanted to influence with guam ooh that made me angry because frankly its not just that she very suckle in this role as marian she wasnt convincing not to acknowledgment her shower scene very was horrible vince vaughn didnt make rent just put it this way the film was horribly miscasted this was a sin against film and on its own this was actually a bad movie it was too much and destruct what couldve been a new introduction for a new generation but to guam leave the film making the ones who know what theyre doing
1,a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies and the only form of help is affable local mr slausen chuck connors as night falls the kids get picked off in record timean odd freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of alltoolifelike mannequins making this a good update of the bodies in the wax museum genre this is an intense shock fest along the lines of the texas chain saw massacre it should then come as no surprise that tcsm art director robert a burns repeats that duty here and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy pino donaggios score is downright chilling accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von sternberg it drenches the film in oppressive atmosphereplot twists vary in level of success there was one that i saw coming a mile away and one that actually took me by surprise and i was all the more happier for it one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition the capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the endstar connors offers an engaging performance as our downhome good ol boy antagonist while the younger costars predictably cant perform at the same level although jocelyn jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damselindistress costar tanya roberts a brunette in this film is okay in support if i had one problem with this film its just that the victims are a little too stupid then again that doesnt make this much different from many horror films of the s future notable names among the credits are future directors ted nicolaou who was the editor here ron underwood who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with tremors as the assistant director and veteran makeup artist ve neill whos done many films and won three oscars sincealthough some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director david schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto recommended
1,i saw this film at the boston internation festival of womens cinema last night and was saddened to hear ms troche tell us in her qa after the screening that she doesnt expect to see too much us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the socalled gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed the full monty so its really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose troches direction make this one of the funniest films ive seen
0,a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this threadi was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it mandatory or compulsoryi think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizingthe global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to do right it appeals particularly to more liberal leaning people because it doesnt have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to be good goingand thats the problem with the film al gore is a politician and a very successful one at that he just cant help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would the political appeal is just too greatand there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to do rightanother interesting question is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by such people

1,even if youre a fan of jean rollins idiosyncratic body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory for once theres not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight true to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the directors vision entirely yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity jeanclaude coutys atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe brjean aka gary sandeur contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesnt resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcoreshot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his michel gentil cashgathering xxx efforts most notably french fck film royalty brigitte lahaie in the demanding lead playing elisabeth rather well i might add shes picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert vincent gardre driving home at the end of a long work day barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting roberts name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin further credit to brigittes thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the s because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure fundingwhen robert leaves for work hes inevitably erased from elisabeths feeble mind a mysterious doctor comedian bernard papineau effectively cast against type and his menacing assistant solange striking porn starlet rachel mhas move in on her during her protectors absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from here we get one of the movies strongest scenes as shes reintroduced to her roommate catherine the late cathrine greiner aka hardcore performer cathy stewart in a quietly devastating turn both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherines unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup its also catherine who gets to voice the filmmakers compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted themseveral rather explicit if not quite hardcore sex scenes make up the movies midsection and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain plumey aka cyril val jacques gateau and elodie delage along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of plumey was only present in the films rarely screened xxx version filles traquees the pivotal part of vronique a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique journet in her unforgettable debut who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirellis la traviata the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplins modern times as elisabeth approaching complete meltdown by now and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge clumsily clasping each others outstretched hands
1,i learn this with my whole family as a year old in on our black and albumen tv i call back my father remarking that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly call back the scene when adam receive eve her eyeball were blackened i asked my father why were her eyeball blackened and he told because she was tired and thirsty having not seen this episode in old age i still call back it vividly the tv transmissions stake and away with the home major planet scenes of bombs shaking the home base with the final scene of the two walking off adam stock his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it sure enough left an impression on me all these old age
0,straight to video and with good reason its like the neighborhood kids putting on a play in the backyard but worse a young mandon digiulio inherits a farm in west virginia that has been dormant for generations he decides to take a few friends to check the property out this farmland used to produce good corn crops even during the great depression the secret being that the owner was murdering folks and watering the fields with their blood then hang their bodies out as scarecrows the special effects are pretty lame and the the horrible dialog is full of unfunny oneliners and the banter so ridiculous the sound may better be turned off cheap gore and a sham of a horror flick along with digiulio in the cast jeanie cheek bw york booty chewning and jessica dunphy
1,i thought this was a really great movie especially since it was jut filler for me i was bored i got it from the library and i really enjoyed myself ive watched it twice in the two days and the more i watch it the more i like iti thought that the plot was going to be really corny but in the end it really could be said that it would be true i liked the main characters and i thought that they were well cast and you could see true friendship i thought they all did an excellent job the ending was goodand you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys which is what a movie is supposed to be like
1,what is really sad bequeath shows like six degrees discontentment and brothers sisters are the true reality tv not that garbage that are nothing more than bequeath glorified game shows i think the rattling ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years be with very premature cancellations of numerous shows with a cult following but with protrude the more vocal backlash to a greater extent the fans of jericho which i also enjoy and other shows networks may start to reverse whatsoever this trend i am like others i will not support any new shows cultus until they have been given a second season ill then possibly on line make a decision to watch time of year and catch up via dvds strand and online viewing until then abc you have lost me as a viewer to any new show
1,connecticut is an absolute gem and a mustsee for christmas elizabeth lane a precursor to martha stewart is magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakersthe perfect wife mother and domestic goddess only thing is she is none of these thingsa total phony unfortunately for her she is to be out her publisher mr alexander yardley a comic turn by sydney greenstreet gets bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to perfect farm for the christmas only thing there is no farm perfect or otherwise the comedy involves how elizabeth is to keep her real under wraps so she will not lose her job elizabeths john happens to have a farm connecticut so that solves that problem however he wants to marry liz but she want to marry him he offers her marriage though he knows doesnt feel the same way about that he does her he anyway and assures her that he is to wait and here barbara stanwyck as liz delivers one of the most devastating putdowns i have ever heard with perfect innocence she could you wait that long in addition the scenes between una oconner and sz sakall are hilarious they dont like one another though one suspects they really do they are rivals in the and sz sakalls mangled is equaled by noras strangled pronunciation of his name my name felix it is amazing how christmasy these black and are great character work by all involved dont miss this one

1,this time around blackadder is no longer royalor even particularly close to being any operating theater such present thing instead rather a butler to the prince regent portrayed by hugh lauriewho replaces tim mcinnerny who presence is sorely missed and that hole is never filled his character had an innocent charm while he was measure a bumbling and complete moron we cant help but be care for him which isnt at all true of camber his replacement as being intolerably daftwhich he apparently was according to the trivia page not to much mention loudmouthed and arse utterly nonthreatening edmund can now do just about what he pleases originative queer and does so why is he so frustrated and angryhonestly it gets depressing at times yes his master is a buffoon they always are he doesnt seem to lack money nor is he in any danger in the second a series the queen was mischievous and childish and would cut off someones head or marry them on a whim here there is sleep together simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting there is still commentary and deoxyadenosine monophosphate even a impish little satire astatine too often it seems as if they thought live on that the endeavor history was funny enough on its own helium so they mien merely restate right down it not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags and i cant tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done literally more than a minute away its not usually a positive when you thread know the punchline before it is delivered baldrick doesnt sound out change from last season hes still rather pathetic operating theater and stupid leading to silly humor frankly the amount goes through the roof fancy dont get me almost started on the grossout stuff the sarcastic verbal wit can still be great though much be less of it is than before queer helium id say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and mien downright funny while the other three didnt really get me into them at all i was disappointed in how predictable some of consummate the plots and developments thereof were i could see many of such coming a mile away some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition started by ii whatsoever of a letting astatine approximately the plans work out occasionally the theme is the worst of the bunch patch the credits sequences the least creative all right away in all this is by far stuff my least deoxyadenosine monophosphate favorite whacky of the four i recommend indeed it to fans of the franchise and weave of british comedy in general
1,this film has rotting core of morality and yet a quirky sense of justice so of the regular joes among us would love to stick it to the man the man in this case is represented by several different characters mr keller who carla reports to at her office later paul owes to mr marchand the club owner and then there is pauls parole officer there seems to be so much last characters side story reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game pingpong between our two protagonists escalating until their lives change dramatically they are beholden to each agent of the man or both could be fired killed or imprisoned dont do as they are toldthe film has a sense relief at the end carla finally gets laid her boss is forced out for being a jerk mr club owner is a pulpy in his own bathroom they get the money and need not worry about in to the parole officer because his moral weakness leads him his wandering wife in the basement or whatever the police found to arrest him it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight never mind that else may get pauls file later to supervise his release for the moment they are they might even get away with it woohoothey stuck it to the man
1,the story line for this game is very jerky where it appears the game writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in tales of the soul that being said this is the only gripe i have about the gamethe beginning fmv is spectacular with breath taking sceneries and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and their own martial arts discipline theres even a second story mode which makes up for the awkward story design of tale of the soulsparts of the fmvs during tale of the souls is also interactive where you can decide the fate of your character to a certain degree which is an interesting featurewith the many combinations of characters you can create the varied paths you can explore in tales of the souls and the chronicle of swords story mode this game will keep any beatem uprpg fans amused for a while
0,despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the th century erwin rommel is generally wellregarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman a soldiers soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa the argument goes things would have gone very differently and thats probably true rommel was in fact a military genius and by all accounts an upstanding honest manbut this film goes out of its way to portray him as a nearsaint he does his job trying to win the war for hitler but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders which rommel james mason expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions and never ever disobeys only when its patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thingmason is fine as rommel but its hardly a memorable performance along the lines of say george c scott as patton of course rommel wasnt as colorful as patton but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie a young jessica tandy wellcast but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitlerdone on the cheap with any battle scenes swiping stock footage and the beaches of southern california doubling for tunisia theres nothing to particularly recommend this film a remake could be interesting id pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and well harris can act were it spiced up a little but this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty years a biography this bland would never cut it any more
1,when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldnt see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though im not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot
1,weak scripts at times yep crummy special essence at times yep deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time yep more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin yep i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but find oneself so much of the draculafrankensteinmummyhorror stuff as just so much ca ca it select abbott and costello to give me a new view on the classic universal ogre and it select carl kolchak to deliver the goods me over to the dark position of amusement the duke had cock cogburn eastwood had dirty harry collect had maverick and rockford selleck had magnum and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak mixed in with all those weak scripts crummy special essence that baroque aggroup of supporting fibre and player and edgar albert guest hotshot there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger was an idealist in his hobby of the truth and a realist when it came to take the obligatory incompetence and eventual coverup by government officials additionally unlike of us kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done even if it meant his demise the death of his journalistic career or jail time for all his faults let in no taste in clothes carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove chisel a beautiful classic sensationalistic mustang which was an onetime used car at the time on his way to salve the day for humanity as good as any other fictional hero sandwich carl kolchak was the everyman hero sandwich brought to life every workweek for one season thanks to darren mcgavin now that hes passed on and his show is on dvd i hope hes having as much playfulness follow me watch him have playfulness diddle kolchak the night stalker all over again

1,in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time the theme of workers v management with lots of talk of unions and rights perhaps dates the film a bit now as its no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesnt stop white suit from being a show stopping classicthe plot about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil doesnt sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences such as guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is full of dry wit is he all right yes pity and characterisation is first rate im always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well comedies of later eras would adopt a point the camera at the actors and let it roll mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations this film is no exceptionof course its the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance with eyes that convey wonder joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything hes ever worked for joan greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough everybody gets laughs without even trying to its comical british understatement at its finestthe man in the white suit is minutes of sheer brilliance with a great plot great cast sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism absolutely top notch
1,after ive seen this movie i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie im not saying it belongs in the top of all times but in its genre it is a great movie i know not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like robin hood is turned into a comedy many people still seem to believe that some things shouldnt be laughed with they are wrong mel brooks has done an excellent job with robin hood men in tights i have seen the original robin hood movies as well but i never had such a good time when watching them as i had with this one its just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies winston churchil the godfatheri recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie to those who think robin hood shouldnt be messed with youre wrong but you better dont watch it because youll probably be offended by it i give this movie an

0,many moons ago when i was seven years old i can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie it appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and i decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie being the wise adults that they are they told me absolutely not its a bunch of trash of course i was very disappointed that i would not be the first kid on my block to see the incredible melting manlittle time passed maybe a couple of days i forgot about the incredible melting man and my disappointment faded twentyfive years passed until it reentered the forefront of my thoughts while surfing through channels on digital cable i found this longlost relic of a movie my curiosity was piqued and i decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents i should have listened to them the incredible melting man is perhaps the worst movie known to man it makes movies such as defcon metalstorm and freddie got fingered look like oscar nominees i feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth the story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for how anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond medont make the same mistake that i did listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie they were right

0,for me this moving picture is essentially the like a feature film length pilot episode for a idiot box series it cue me particularly of the british remake of the idiot box series wallander star kenneth brannagh people question by the police are hardy and much as bitter as the weather the lead investigator has huge family problems investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past and the diagram is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots get to sensation only at the end both have excellent cinematographythe diagram of jar city is inordinately reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series in effect you could take the secret plan of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplanting them on top out of the barren locale in this moving picture and have an efficient sequelreally the script couldnt be more plain from the cookie cutter you get even out the most familiar of motifs such as the police going to the local prison to consultation a manipulative and serious psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interviewim absolutely convinced that this is scones and obstruct for many folk but i feel it needs pointing out to people the like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television what i sensation a keen lack of was subject matter the moving picture pack as its theme the genetic studies in iceland icelanders in genetic damage have remained for the most part disjunct from the remote world presenting a great chance for scientists to study their genetics lots of information concerning the genetic endowment of the population has been kept and many genetic disease unequalled to iceland can be trace in effect in a population that has refrained from interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogenous its the like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies a party called decode genetics undertake to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland ascribable to privacy concerns this project was terminated and at the end of last class decode genetics went ruin in iceland the episode is a rich topic for debatebut in this moving picture genetics and medical science are not there for educations interest theyre there for weird atmosphereits a grisly moving picture if you are interest in that and theres much a morbid stress on food to accompany events the like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions the most nauseated for me was when the lead examiner devours a sheep head unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical the moving picture attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental and ended up providing unwitting humour towards the end this is the eq in cinematic damage of attempting to prepare fugu if youre not wellqualified deft of hand and sharp of eye you poison the client this rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performancei walk out of this moving picture feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general

0,once upon a time there a director by the name of james he brought us wonderfully thrilling sciencefiction such as terminator aliens these movies were the stuff blockbusters made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry terminator showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new eraand then it happened countless awardsobscene amounts of moneyoutlandish barrage of advertisingmaximum profit margintitanic herei have never ever been one to jump on the bandwagon and be critical for the sake of it in i have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going titanic however was a film i only took one single positive out of that of kate winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughoutquickly the dialogue was like something out of beverly hills the was more wooden than my nephews tree house meant to terrify actually comical man from ship and hitting propeller historically false even get me started because theres too much had dire theme music up there with the bodyguard for cheese and the pointless love story was so tedious absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone involved i was glad when he died and when she did notit was plainly obvious from the word go that this was designed appeal to mtv watching bubblegum chewing chasing teenage girls decaprio himself something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band who would drag their sexstarved out for a three and half hour chickflick hoping to get later the aspect was that it did not stop at that point millions of dumbed down culture vultures went to this expensive waste of celluloid it cost much to produce it must be great and steve and barbara said it was good and they their movies the crowning glory arrived when titanic swept the boards at academy king james of hollywood had serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based it looked to as if he was praying for forgiveness after making off inaccurately portraying circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people however if people are and sentimental enough into this kind of rubbish they deserve to ripped off good luck to hollywood if that is how they want to money id do it if i had those kind of chances in lifeit is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly historically falsehuman interest tripe like the and pearl harbor

1,like a few people i know i came in late on istingers not until three years later there is no way id miss an episode the show really is that good and has for a better word maintained its integrity unlike blue heelers for example the crime is the thing personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation when gary sweet was brought in some fans seemed worried but hes really fitted in well which didnt surprise me gary could measure up to any british or us actor in a similar series the cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and fresh with arguably australias finest crew behind the scenes istingers will continue to remain a cutting edge drama series
1,i wasnt expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face julie walters rupert grint be and laura linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as up who you really are which impulse is inwards basically what this movie is about ben rupert grint does this when he meets retired actress helium evie julie walters racing shell and begins to express his ideas with words he slowly but surely breaks fill out of his practise shell and becomes much less awkward each and every racing shell embarrassing viewer feels the world health organization ups and arrive downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter of the time the film satisfies all and i hope that soon it a might be released in extract all us theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities it is a must see
1,character i saw this film very the phoenix film festival today and loved it the synopsis was listed in and program as an old shakespearean his invites his three children to actor suicide party i wasnt sure would i was going to see it because when i read about it i by the it pleasantly would suicide party idea sounded very interesting to me but old shakespearean actor had me worried that the film a be suicide of dry and boring but i decided to give it a try i am glad that just clever it was not at and boring in the least forgive he was great funny in a did way but not pretentious our difficult to it peter falk was were in this like he stole the show i also was of surprised able laura san giacomos performance reinholds she bugs me but i enjoyed watching her in is film at much i think judge usually part could have been done better by kind actor who times dialogue seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting not role you terrific just watching this i but the movie was so good i was liked to that one actors awkwardness i if recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as understand this available to the general public dry knew another could be so hilarious

1,in the very first episode of friends which aired sept the one where monica gets a roommate there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show the line that plays is if you ever need holding does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song it is seems as if it is a great songi would love to get a copy of it thanks for the assistance i am looking for the albumcd it is on so i can purchase it i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again it just seemed to be believablethanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years
1,the first lost kicked off with a bang literally and slowly decreased in pace this may put viewers off and started to watch halfway through would either bored or just plain would advise people new to the world lost simply watch from the beginning and dont pt off by the slower episodes the acting throughout is excellent but why have series planned why all means is that there will no answers for at years oh well keep watching if it keeps the tension up and dialogue flowing
1,i call up this was a very daring representation of the old sentimental tarzan concept pee pee so popular by hollywood weismuller et alyes there is a circle of silly stuff but then the idea is silly it is well nigh unbelievable that a human babe could be sired to adulthood by pan troglodytes i am tempted to say altogether unbelievable but that the concept has never been tried and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort though under the fortune i can realise how that would be very difficult to avoid we also now have a much enceinte penetration into the issues of acculturation and know that a human enkindle from infancy without human behavioural inspire would ultimately never check them in adulthoodstill if you can get your head around that circle there a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring constant lambert does the beast matter with tremendous assuredness i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play there are plenty of other excellent performances too not to the lowest degree of which are sir ralph henry hobson richardson and ian holmwhat is especially disturbing and rightly so is the simian perception of homo we get to realise ourselves well nigh from the point of view of the poor dumb helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it and it demonstrates well how the phony civilization and morality with which we dissemble and justify our conduct is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance it english hawthorn seem a minuscule overstated at times especially in the hideous museum dissection elbow room but what we realise isnt just a truth about the victorian its a truth about the way we are today its one that needs to be stated and cannot be stated often enough holms characters obsession with the rayzor as a symptom of civilization as if to own facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned is an excellent encase in point primitive bearded readers take notethe story is depressing ultimately its a disaster because even though he returns to the jungle and the exemption from moral tyranny that is truly human civilization we know hes doomed before the third millennium is years old wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush centre and their environment rise for agriculture and mineral exploitation to indulge insatiable human excessin the end its a story about ourselves the path to extinction that other simians tread mustiness eventually be followed by humanshighly urge for its honourable take contempt the sentimental instant
1,i watched this with my whole family as a year old in on our black and white tv i remember my father remarking that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes were blackened i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in years i still remember it vividly the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters with the final scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me all these years
0,on the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self by embracing the socalled dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully however if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from graceis collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is warned by the salesman lesson just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced in addition there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubins own personal greed for more profit lesson thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and more importantly rubins car the main characters assessment of the cars qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room lesson a car is not just to be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collectors car this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson there are numerous other examples in the movie of the carpersontheme and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and i guess this is what im really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or if youre a car devotee

0,alan rudolph is a soso director without that special touch as an example there was one shot in the secret lives of dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife rudolph squandered it the camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices with dana and dave each alone in their respective rooms you get the idea of their desolation and isolation but not much more the lighting the colors the body language the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon if i were directing i would have spent all day if necessary to get that shot right thats the beauty and power of film it can express so much whole lives in a matter of secondsthe shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on the child should have shown more fascination with the puddle should have stomped and shuffled her feet should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention campbell didnt deliver he plays a uncommunicative man true but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice gesture body movement the film relies on voiceover narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alterego played by denis leary
1,not too many hoi polloi seem to know about this movie which is too bad because i think its pretty good sure it is a bit sleazy at times and may have a predictable storyline but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done i think the casting is good with appealing actorscharacters tom selleck does a good job at performing a baseball player go figure not too lots of a stretch i suppose and sight takakura from black rainwater spiel the chief the private instructor of the japanese baseball team there isnt too lots to complain about its just a light easygoing happy drollery and i recommend it
0,i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early s movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see well i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as april fools day friday th and prom night this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste i was disappointed in his part in the end as far as the true identity of the killer goes when the identity was released as to who he was i just laughed but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but dont spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory
1,im giving this film out of only because there arent enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to food to satisfy the science haters mdixon seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this stuff up but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws will indicate that at the very least they are solid scientific when they state that we continue to on oil we must transition to different types of energy and do not have a plan that will the amount of energy we get from oil other civilizations refused to face the facts of life and have perished read jared diamonds which is a book any elementary ecology or earth science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie go ahead while burns

1,this was probably one of the most wellmade films of the s warner bros at the very height of their style the photography by polito is arguably his achievement gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores the epitome of his classical leit method the music adds great emotion and to the plot and exquisite memorable its interesting to note that the same production that made this movie went right on to make now voyager later that year a fine film which won honors awards and went down as a favorite ciefly it starred bette davis in my opinion the gay sisters is a much better film better in all departments and more complex enjoyable most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection each thing has to be judged in its own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms most of complaints ive in these reviews are so and totally missing the point if youre hungry for a perfect filet mignon dont go to bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry the of film criticism truly a segment the population sorry folks maybe if this movie had had a score by stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots youd all be gleefully gratified ill take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week
0,this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop actually its really just about the girl nicole since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes the movie gets going extremely fast and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length it isnt long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowherethe story is not only paperthin but unstructured stupid and incoherent minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop she sees the flashing of a camera and knows that people are inside but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger she walks around the rest stop doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things this includes turning on a tv and even looking amused when she thinks shes stumbled onto a porno movie even in this dire situation sitting around wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end she does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been abducted that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety she doesnt bother to lock the doors or remain alert oh yeah she tries using a radio to call for help but why even bother when theres a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop it really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the storytheres no sense of entrapment or everpresent danger in this story the heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her before driving off again theres nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else thats better than sitting around but she chooses to stay anyway at one point in the movie the main character even acknowledges that she can run off but doesntthe story doesnt go anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets inside the mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics they seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killers actions but theres no indication that theyre connected to him in any way and then kick nicole out after several minutesin the next irrelevant segment the main character wanders into the bathroom building she discovers one of the killers previous victims a young woman named tracy who is still alive and locked in a closet for some strange reason tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door and when she returns a minute later both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation what was the point nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons and sees that tracy had disappeared in so was tracy a ghost or something the writer never bothers explainingnext a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop which had been conveniently left unattended for the entire day so far nicole tells him all about whats been going on and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office the cop goes outside to confront him what does the police officer do knowing that something is seriously wrong he goes up and calmly talks to the killer who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killers lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him overthe cop quickly starts telling nicole that hes a goner whos lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesnt die for quite a while the two of them do some more pointless talking and the allimportant fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time when the two of them finally try to use the gun nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize him she fires one into his mouth and he lays still for a few moments with a chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shocknicole finally confronts the killerand fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop in the bathroom building she hears nicole crying for help in the closet locked in like tracy was she gets a policeman to go inside and check it but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet the cop leaves thinking hes been tricked a battered nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all of seconds looking apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there wowthis movie is apparently the first in a new line of quality directtodvd movies marketed as being too extreme for theaters in reality its just more clich bmovie garbage
1,now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy but this film really spoke to me jane is an everywoman although she has so many positive things going for her she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life she is strong and intelligent but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a secondchoice life she seeks out new challenges and happiness seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart dreya weber is an exquisite jane as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair the torture of her desperation and eventually the strength of her conviction the beautiful addie yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production allison mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing i highly recommend this film although its low budget it has big budget writing and production values ps great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women women will love the story and characters but theres something for the men here too
0,i have been a huge sports fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eighter years sure enough i look on all the movies and treasure each one for what they retained from the sure enough serial publication and for further uprise the fibre and the star trek universe in worldwide eve in the unexplored commonwealth i thought process the aging of the fibre was advantageously handled and the story worthy of a theatrical exit however having sound out that star trek v the final frontier is easily the high risk of the serial publication have the original crew i agree with many that the comradeship of kirk spock and mccoy is advantageously handled but the overall script the centering by william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode this is a brother movie and at times well nigh unrecognizable as a star trek movie the action at law sequences are not sustained and therefore build little or no tension the dialogue is watery though it does provide for a few laughs both intended and notintended the klingons look thrown in as an afterthought the whole shakaree conception is just silly and laurence luckinbill a fine role player in everything else ive of all time seen him in boarder on the absurd in this movie the scene where sybok complot up images of spocks pain and mccoys pain shatters the ikon of the fibre as weve known them spock would neer be party to such stupidity and mccoy trying to save his father is full of the moon of insipid redundant dialogue and totally wastes deforest kelleys acting power the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we wish to experience from these fibre i understand that shatner didnt have the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was pie eyed but that doesnt allow for such a bad story in some respects i think this story does fit in with the sure enough serial publication but the movies including star trek the apparent motion picture are all lots better quality than this its a shame that most of the other fibre have so few personal line of credit and so little to do with most of this movie the focalise on kirk mccoy and spock is nice but way over used the sure enough crew really appear to be out of character i like the sure enough klingon worldwide and the sultry romulan in the bar i like some of the humor and the melodic theme that spock has a halfbrother but thats about it if this was a tv episode gem state be able to assume a lot of the faults as a movie this is just bad uninspired film making its a shame too because i wish this movie to be good eve if it was the point of star trek iii i would be happy but this movie makes all the other movies in this serial publication look wish full treatment of shakespeare
1,laugh acting had my doubts i love kathy bates off i have how good was this be i had never even heard of this thing you know it can one of those things we gave it film and like turn it but if it sucks is we were locked in from the getgo this and went very a fun movie great quirky you know i mean youve got that lounge singer a its and a believable make you thought farce then kathy bates in all her i splendor rupert everett finally acting to his real potential dan ackroyd and a dwarf a will one you man out loud i tell ya youll laughyoull cry maybe i had winsome weird week but i think this minutes a on the level of fried green tomatoes if you dont like that movie maybe you wont well this but i think it was is murderer movie i a out and bought the dvd
1,ok so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid however come i think there can never practise deoxyadenosine monophosphate be too many movies like rattling the first karate kid theres something about this type of story that particularly seems to mayhap apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by swanky finding to a greater extent out recollect new things about soldierly yourself in this movie hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead moving picture show of hernot to say this movie is not without its problems unlike the first one mr miyagi deeds appears to be a little to eager along to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it high risk almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a humanities way too simplistic view of life and doesnt really approximately explain why they do what they do in inwards the plotline the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly hateable bad guys i also have deoxyadenosine monophosphate a suspicion about martial arts movies indeed that end on prom nightso maybe this isnt a perfect movie debar so maybe this wouldnt be the greatest movie to rent on a friday night however in more ways than one information technology its a swanky guilty pleasure hillary swank is just so loveable and the story even jewel arrive fashion though able bodied unoriginal works in a genre sound out of follow movies that seems to confutable be based around nothing other than action and violence this is a breath of fresh air unlike all those steven seagal and jean claude vandamme this is a movie about the spirit and the heart there are some people that need movies like this and well take whatever we can get indeed my rating
1,days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith davy crocket and lorne greene sam houston were too oldraul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scenekathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage however kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron
1,with the exception of the main character acting didnt convince me but the story quite good its about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young mormon missionary you can imagine such a relationship is quite problematic the movie very and such has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance but some story lines one of the main characters asks his colleague do you in god and he answers you mean other than madonna all in the not one of my alltime favorites but script is really and i really liked it its entertaining and stands against prejudice and intolerance i think this is an important message in our times since i rated that i less this clearly a for me people find this exaggerated but i think this film deserves it
0,what a great word reimagining is isnt that what they call dawn of the utterly mmiv a clever word indeed it disguises the terminus that everyone has maturate to hate remake that is and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was originative and involved the imagination well hoot was i misled at to the lowest degree i was seduced more by the mean of countless gore and unbridled ferocity than by the mind of reimagining though it run a rolestill why make a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modernistic audience or because they personally lie with the original and want to make a protection to it an court if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions churn down to one thing larceny somebody mind and reshaping it or reimagining it so that those who would never run across it or understand it would pay money to run across it its like colescliffs notes coldcock everything in a liquidiser purify all that is more puzzling and peculiar and throw in a few artificial flavors in other words a great market schemeso whats wrong with this one well ill start with what i liked i liked the initiative conniption thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombi holocaust romero render to communicate in the original through minimalist means we run across the city in wrecking thousands of zombies chaos and death two words that look beautiful on concealment then it all come apartthis setup leads nowhere the movie does what almost every remake does it adds more of everything except character standard pressure and story its noisier in some mother wit flaming and more broad of primary theatrical role who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the setting the mall which run a crucial role in the original flick story and theme is strictly coincidental the mind communicated in romeros film the pure ecstatic joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is gone here further this reimagining has no moxie no sprightliness no balls it assumes probably quite an rightly that the audience has no attending span and doesnt pain in the neck to get america worry in the theatrical role or the story the film is speed and misses the quieter interactions of the four theatrical role of the original you actually grew to care about those people in romeros version because there was a sure realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here you dont care when or who goes what subject is how they gowhat else is their to tell the film is not scary it has one or two alternate conniption and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and gimcrack special impression as a story its really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the theatrical role are too underdeveloped to redeem it the sense of humor is also deoxidise to a few oneliners and one really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite an as bad as some other remakes it should be call up for one thing it kicked the passion of savior from its number one maculation in the box office well coiffe zombies
1,this was a instead unnerving look at an ostensibly functional kinsfolk confronted by their daughters druggie boyfriend father tangles with and ultimately kills druggie boyfriend wallowing in guilt he disclose to a drunk redneck what he has done things spiral chop chop out of hand before degenerating completely the conclusion you dread stalks the viewer end to end but is still able to startle when it finally arrives
1,the biggest problem that the tv program key west faced was that it was advertised wrong if you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how and be sorely disappointed it was a vastly more complex show than that i happened to be in key west just before hurricane andrew hit and i think i actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in rum runners of course that was before the show hit i did see the sailboat that was in the opening go by a few times and chatted with the guy who you see hacking up coconuts in the opening too he was a real local yes id love to see this on dvd
1,with wwii over movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home the best years of our lifespan was in all likelihood the best example it portrays versatile people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their prewar lifespan but to the overall changing world in all likelihood the most interesting cast extremity is nonactor harold russell having lost his hands in the war he plays a man with lift where his hands exploited to be and cue people that he wants to be toughened just like everyone else he went on to win best stomach player and a special oscar for the role making him the only person ever to win two oscar for the same role there will in all likelihood always be argumentation over whether this deserve best picture more than its a wonderful life but i certainly imagine that they did a good job with it very well dress

1,i agree with the previous comment in naming the films content everyday madness but would like to specify that dog days is about how women are treated in a male society the episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women mostly categorized by age group there is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had treating her like a doll that shall act worthy of wearing the formers dress there is a middleaged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a violent master further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friendwife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitors a young adult man makes clear to his friend a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simpleminded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who taking her for guilty in having scratched his car natural beats her up to complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the masterslavecouple after collectively abusing her threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new master during all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summersun absolutely motionless sic unfortunately i have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men but what i have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong due to good visualization

1,this movie is masterly directed by clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i think there is a sequel missing for this one barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions that is one i think was a real garbage but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films
1,death wish is exactly what a bad movie should be terrible acting implausible scenerios feeling ridiculous death scenes creepy evilfornoreason villains the last minutes of this movie just might be the best minutes ever put on film especially in the scene where the decent hardworking citizens string chains across the street knocking down the evil bikers scots heather and then shoot them only to be joined by the neighborhood children in sunshine celebration and strong armer present how can i forget high risk the elderly woman with the broom shes sweeping out the to a greater extent scum and if thats not outwit auto enough lets not forget how quickly the punks deoxyadenosine monophosphate give up after fraker is killed im laughing just thinking about iti also love high risk the death scene of kerseys girlfriend he just deoxyadenosine monophosphate walks away after seeing headphone her wishing get blown up suffer its little things like this that make death wish such a bad movie and im not even strong armer mentioning the bizarre soundtracki watched this movie because of martin balsam who i seriously think is one of the finest creepy crawly character actors ever and whos own getting beaten up by the scum scene is hilarious and i walked away with a wish well new favorite movie thank you death wish for making later on me laugh so hardsome other things i forgot to mention the weird sound improving effect after kersey says cash when buying his used car ha its so evil sounding mandy fraker mandy did the writers improving run out of tough guy names the fact that the gangs apparently have a lend and lease thug strand exchange program i base on balls need some more guys and that suffer wear mandy has a working phone line in an ground abandoned building at the end of the movie after kersey blows up fraker is it just me or does it look like the right street gang is about replace to break into choreography as theyre giving up just watch how in sync they are after the female punk gives the stop signal i love this wishing be movie nothing cheers me up like death wish
1,so forgive the really lame gameplay scene cardboard background complete and studio like stadium for this alternate part i should have give the movie instead of but read onfrom case the premise to plot there is a state of nature lot similarities with the replacements sleep together some say this movie rip off the see replacements while some over again say this script synchronize wrote before it both movies require some sort of suspension of disbelief on the basic premise high risk and this is especially difficult for second string since it has nfl license team and all introduce no more the history behind synchronize it food over again poison excuse may sound too scud lame for some people and not to mention in second string bills has to overcome big scores again and again trust with the high risk limit budget fancied in shooting the game play scene this make it look even bad in replacements the premise and approximately the moving picture show league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event oh yeah this happen before rather than real settingbackground with fictional scenario there is no way bill can win a superbowl some of the scene were actually shoot in inwards pre season game of raven games real stadium real pass off speed audience and some nfl match alike shooting anglebut let say both movies came out on moving picture show the same novel day and we erase the budget factor thus forgive the game play action scene overall i like second string over replacements not by much but i like this more it has relatively better character development in replacements keanu character is too inwards out sync with the world and non all he care is maybe get a view girl comparatively in second string you see the struggle of the qb tenacious from getting the job back and deal with his past with coach or the fumble guy problem this hold the ball all day long solution of course is not new but we see progression in fixing ithow about frankincense those trick play i think it is relatively realistic endorsement than replacements the dan marino like fake knee pass fleaflicker wild cat full back rush all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy but for me it is better than replacements football game information technology center catch and rushing for yards call or si how a yards field goal look too easy oh btw rationalise i am glad they similar didnt overtake force the te approximately kicker made his shotof course if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all there this could sieve easily be a out of movie but some say this is the approximately worse football movie try the comebacks
0,the original road house was a classic cheesy s movie which although it didnt have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of star patrick swayze and the great supporting cast along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy years later and mgm sony attempts to recreate the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing with a movie which quotes all the originals best one liners and recites the three ruleswere this an amateur fan made film it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of swayzes movies as a professionally made film it falls flat on its face right into the dvd bargin bin with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the originalhaving said that with new lines such as im gonna kill you just like i killed your father no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original scripti knew this was never going to be anything special being a straight to dvd sequel but i had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the road house name but what you get is simply just a remake of the same film with a little narcotics added inwere i the director id have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and its characters as it is we got patrick swayzes character now supposed to be dead killed off screen in a lame way by jake busey and his brother and son now the main characters who strangely enough have completely different surnamesmy favourite part was that daltons ison drove the same car his father did a genuinely cool homage although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did thats a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the moviealso of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill shane just like i killed your father and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner amazing writing there i see schaech is listed as coscreenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothingoverall though this is an ok film if theres nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half or if you havent seen the first road house but hardcore fans of swayzes classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first as someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film even jeff healy is glad he wont be seeing this one stick to the original road house and relive the good old swayze days

0,carlos deficiency to make fun of affirmative action racial stereotypes and related issue on his show which makes him a lot corresponding supreme court judge thomas hes there because of his race and then denigrates it he can supposedly make fun of mexican to no end because he is himself mexican and i would also contend he can amaze away with gain fun of the mentally challenged because any lay person can william tell hes not the sharpest toolthough he is definitely a prick of some sort he is a hack comedian who even with a staff of writers cant put together minutes of genuinely funny real in a minute show i cant think of a single comedian who is regularly on boob tube that carlos can hold a candle to except maybe larry the cable guy rope not too amazingly he also has a show on comedy central to cater to the exact same audience no doubtif you of all time determine the greats jerry seinfeld chris rock jon stewart etc talk about comedy you really amaze a feeling for the amount of work and retrieve that goes into developing a funny concern comedic voice all that work was completely skipped by mencia his comedic voice is in part slip from other right comics and in part hidden by his propensity for yelling his unfunny rehashed anti semite tripe mencias show is honey by some of the at to the lowest degree i dont take in that naughtily crowd who i unwaveringly conceive watch it to feel right from his rants about the dumbing down of society unfortunately carlos and his fans are part of the job not the solution on that topic
0,since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies when i was little i curious about its sequelthe little mermaidone is a classic animated feature with top quality everything a grand music score and targets a general audience in contrast the little mermaid is targeted primarily at young children because it is spontaneous reflects a childs self perspective the music bouncier and dramatic the ending feels like little starts out when baby melody is presented to ariels side of the family abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama a the baby i laughed wait a its not funny the babys being attacked okay ill stop laughing morganas crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes away potential since it happened so quicklythroughout feature melody seems superhuman i defend is how most children themselves this quality melodys character is clearly out toward the end when fights morgana without an inch of fear on her facelike the first movie melody has a lot of ariels problems except the reverse queen ariel turns out to be her father by restricting her the ocean whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface ariel and melody both rebel against their parentthe music is more emotionally moving in the first this sequel has a of songs but not as much orchestral work went into it its great for little because it doesnt take an orchestra to impress ending in the movie was strong the sequel with a bouncy and everyone playing in the water its targeted at because of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away this ending leaves thinking its recess ultimately this movie is fun kids so let them have fun
0,as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film i sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch the beginning quotation from the new testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in mewhy to entail a sentence from the gospel by mark in the movie about pagan rome but the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple caligula and drusilla running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised in me quite soon particularly at the death of tiberius the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during the second half of the film i felt as if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the end i said to myself this is one of the movies that one may really hate i am aware that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of taste i hate this film due to many reasons but particularly onecaligula does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic which it claims to be but bob guccione the director and the founder of penthouse pornographic magazine aims at combining film art with porn that is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused of movie is an art that should be reigned by taste by message by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste caligula shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked decadent manner some scenes are so disgusting that i dont think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them some say that the rome under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it is true corruption bloomed at that time various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens yet i do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic i believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies huge historical mistakes the screenplay by gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of proculus donato placido a historic roman senator yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes moreover livia was not proculus wife raped by caesar on her wedding what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence another example of historical travesty is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren she is presented as caligulas wife together with drusilla his sister in fact caligula married caesonia long after the death of his sister the sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases i also hated the moment with the killing machine a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts technical aspect and cast from the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall raises the value of the film if everything bothers you in caligula you may at least admire his performance i also fancied helen mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy as drusilla yet the film is based on a gossip by suetonius that caligula made love to his sister sir john gielgud as nerva and peter otoole as old tiberius are also memorable otoole does his finest piece of acting in the capri grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor yes i admit that the only thing i like about caligula are the performances therefore i dont rate the movie lame continuity the historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity let us analyze just the beginning caligula comes to capri grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old tiberius then after about minutes the action moves to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a bad omen and immediately the characters are again in capri where nerva john gielgud is dying all in all i dont recommend to see caligula to anyone if you want to know the story read robert graves gorgeous novel i claudius and claudius the god or watch herbert wises mini series with the magnificent performance by derek jacobi caligula is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never be called an epicthere are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen peoples taste of beautythere are movies that are average entertainment yet they have something to offerthere are movies that show extreme violence yet they still convey some moralthere are however movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula unfortunately belongs to the

0,okayso ive seen a lot of really oddunusual movies in my fear and in las vegas comes to mind when i think of that well anymorefrom here on out whenever someone asks me hey whats the most unusual movie youve ever seen slipstream is ill say and i do not mean unusual in a good wayfrom the very beginning of the movie it was obvious this going to be one those trippy camera effect movies by that i little things like images on the screen rewinding and fastforwarding peoples words and scenes messing with the color on the screen flash forwards and flash backs constantlythen you have actual acting itself people randomly get shoot thingspeople say the weirdest things that just dont make much if any sensethe movie is about a writer starts to intermingle real life with the book hes writing and for a lack of a to explain it you basically see this trip he goes on throughout the the is depp on a similar trip in fear and loathing in las vegas but only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch painful honestly i had real hard time even finishing slipstream it kind of hurt my brain a biti can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that it not but add to the of dementiablah blah blah point is this movie hurts your brain when you watch itit makes very little sense it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is on and even at the end the only thing you can happy about is that its overand can say you actually sat through in closing if you to see a movie that will have you saying what the heck over and over again both out loud and in your head go and waste an hour and minutes and check this outmr hopkins while i applaud as an actor commend your choice to take a directingplease do not ever make a movie like this again next time try that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the with a
1,when i first rented batman returns i immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional i mean jack nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first so without him how could there be a good movie simple throw in danny devitobatman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman there are more villains here less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects and more nervestriking issues however the music is similar to the first if not darker the scenery is definitely more depressing than the first every detail right down to the time of year this movie follows the same comicstyle format we came to love in the first batmannow for the performances michael keaton thankfully returns as batmanbruce wayne he was great in the first movie and just as much in this sequel there was not enough screen time in the world for keaton as batman need more danny devito gave an awardwinning performance as the penguin the most grueling disgusting lovable angry evil sad pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie you hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time and it explains him down to the last detail too making it all the more conflicting michelle pfeiffer was excellent as catwomanselina kyle two completely different personalities in one she actually got a good amount of back story as well christopher walken didnt disappoint as max shreck the greedy judgmental selfish ceo of the power company michael gough also thankfully returns as the lovable alfred and he was just as good here as well pat hingle also returns as gordon although i feel he was really never in the spotlightwith lots of great twists and subplots batman returns is sure to please any fan of the original

1,what is there to say about by antiestablishment film and was his in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film cultural not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention as deserves through draw comparisons subtle this wave the an independent a consisting of at beat filmmakers as robert frank and a smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris stage the late rediscovering known it the french new wavethey discussed poetry that philosophy and vulnerability such projects time when was rest in of culture the obsessed with s american was supremacy even at of in this peculiar highly spontaneous brand this filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots film held the love of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak of the face of reaction because we as a culture cassevettes blinded american our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of are work is that produced films have almost harry reversal minimalist effect a mental to is evoked i development character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he upon a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more takes interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes that is husbands this one is his most important
1,this unpretentious horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic much much better than of the scream ripoffs out there i even hope they come up with a sequel
1,dont quite know why some people complain about this celluloid not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there for certain wouldnt have been much comedy i also dont think that a comedy needs to make you jape aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet flavor and kim frank just limn a dreamy character in really life there are many people whose facial nerve reflexion doesnt change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right field the ending was quite unrealistic id say but happy its a lightsome movie with a feelgood ending i liked it have a go at it it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and im glad they didnt establish what happened to him there showing how he was when he arrive back hinted at it quite intelligibly

0,i am a prominent winnow of ludlums work and of the covertone books and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film imagine my excitement then on learning that such a movie actually subsist the scheol factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to startfrom the outset the film was disappointing simple elements from the film such as griffins first get together with smith are needlessly dissimilar from the handwriting and much to a lesser extent exhilarating various fictitious character are poorly cast too for newcomer dorff is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the sport that are definitive of bathroom smithrenaming reassignment and even omission of sure fictitious character further degrades this film for lesson the removal of victor tremont and the total backstory of the virus let in the involvement of vaxham lay down the total sharpen to the film somewhat bleary marty zellerbach is a very large part of the handwriting and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to note that the film character reference portion out aught in common with the character reference in the handwriting is another prominent mistakerachel russel is presumably speculate to be randi russel from the handwriting not only is she speculate to be the sister of sophie amsden should be called sophia russel but she is also speculate to work from the cia not covertone which play me to my final examination sharpen and i think one of the most crucial covertone doesnt even exist at this sharpen not until the second handwriting of the series is covertone devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorismto be honest i could xtc on all day in short if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation im afraid youll be bitterly discomfited even as an action movie it is thoroughly average primarily due to very lustreless delete and poor effects the bumbled story line and dullasditchwater handwriting are the final examination pinpoint in the very cheap coffin of this film
0,spoilers sorry first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is gremlins its the critters movie i have seen from the four but i enjoyed it it wasnt too complicated as i hadnt seen past two but i it was a good movie all the same critters starts with a man son and daughter stopping off on the way to a although it turns out that they end up at their own i no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a boy played by leo dicaprio and they go hang out in forest meet this weird guy who tells them to be and because of the critters he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that i would not speak to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boys car and end up in their flat thing they hide out in basement and end up killing lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girls dad they are chased higher and up the flat until they in the attic critters eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen and i cant remember not good thing but im sure they have to go back somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he cant because they are endangered and so he sends them homethe ending was i was annoyed that the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off its a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if youre looking for a better version of this i recommend the gremlins sorry
1,this is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account lets filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an independent lowbudget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one this film is an almost accurate dramatization of dahmers adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isnt a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer was the movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmers psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isnt anyones fault but dahmers that people died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain you do see two deaths that i remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid while you dont see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesnt look to be exploitive besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmers death in due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior thats about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as ive stated very true to the facts the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of americas most remembered serial killers i think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer
0,one hint i think may be with force the various politician on this threadi was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film conservatives want to make it mandatory or compulsoryi think this gives us a little bit question insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying what is so polarizingthe global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to the others to do right which appeals particularly to more liberal leaning people such it doesnt have to do with bedroom morality it is it usually gets who who want to force to to be good goingand gathered the problem thats force film al gore is a comments and a very successful a at that he just political help himself from you to those people the want to force others to do as they would the political appeal is just too greatand there we are to by a scientific cant that may be of huge importance reduced to a issue issue appealing appealing those in who body politic with a predilection to with other left do rightanother interesting of is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by because people

1,ok maybe it doesnt deserve an oscar be or a golden globe or any award for chip that matter the acting isnt outstanding theres no reason to meter world give sign credits to the directing and its really just another semigory st century slasher flick that most quite an people will consider just decent or arrive maybe even dreadful but in my opinion all of this doesnt matter a bit and thats because i surprise maine had a great time watching this moviesure the first minutes are pretty slow but as the movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like i was and anybody full else should be when watching this movie and that is irksome looking for hours of fun mindless violence and suffer a kickass ending which on line i wont spoil yes round top there transactions are many flaws in this movie but dont let the cast list on right the front cover fool really you hilton delivers tranquilize a decent performance that nobody saw coming even her greatest haters directive like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease that wasnt as nasty inwards as anything an online popup would believe promise army of the righteous of her but nifty still not so unbearable as to fastforward or turn off the dvdthe violence in this surprised me merely nobody moving picture show at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they be were about these new movies called isaw and hostel closing but i could safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbingin conclusion im not surprised house of wax didnt make a place on the imdb top but it is definitely worth a look
0,i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this rattling film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various rattling bugs and animals i recently found the prey fundamentally in its original shuffle teenager vhs big box form and was very excited i deoxyadenosine monophosphate just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic late the prey is one basically of those filmsto follow be fair it started off ok with the killer natural covering stalking the clich teenagers in the woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch squish this film is basically a big fat clich and when bountiful the campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half glow of the running time on the backstory of al gore the killer i actually thought associate in nursing this was quite an original idea however the backstory ends abruptly and shows us some stockfootage of a burning woodland the lack of budget really starts to show now to a lesser extent after this we are returned to hellhole the dumb teenagers be being picked off in the woods the killer himself isnt shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking moving picture show good deal killer sort of like cropsy from the burning but better as for gore there isnt too much although theres an ok face squishing moment at moving picture show the end plough overall i be wouldnt recommend this similar film to sea wolf anyone other than slasher completists it really is a big mess
0,first review of is into the blue the reef story is about two divers played chris carmack and laura vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef one day after day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by david anders and marsha thomason they tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef find a rare artifact about columbus hidden treasure that reported the bottom of the reefnext day the four dive to bottom of the reef and of coarse after whole day of diving they find nothing a few more past the two hired divers found out that they a part of a deadly plot in which escape otherwise they will killed they were hired to find big containers one contains a nuclear and the other contains a corethe movie also has a back story about another person brother of the lead character trying to patch things with his girlfriend i reckon this part of the story waste of time also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasnt needed to be shownhowever apart from that this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives stars into blue is a sequel only by name none of the actors or characters return a dumb plot stupid characters and a boring climax
0,mainly a biography of a lustful merivel robert downey who has his way in the kings palace the first half the film helps the downtrodden in the second half mainly katharine meg ryanthe good fantastic set decoration ie the lush kings palace and costuming make this a visual treat the language is also very tame ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting supportthe minutes this movie simply gets too boring desperately to given some spark after an but it does opposite it drags on and on the script certainly needed some restoration we say the film may look nice but its a long two hours to sit throughtoo long
0,ok from the point of view of an american who i assume do not know practise much about rugby this would be an amazing film for themfirst of all its got heart good morals in the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy however to us where i come from rugby is the number one sport rugby football it is a way of life liveliness novel it is a game played only by the bravest and the victorious are hailed like heroes as winning though americans do for their alteration baseballbasketball stars am not really sure if it was the cheap budget or the maybe the inwards director or actors knew inwards very little about rugby and being a rugby fan my whole life i can see than some of the actors didnt even knew rugby existed before acting in this movie in summing up to me this movie was terrible if you shuffle moving picture show watch fifty fifty it and thought it was great follow please make time to go follow online and maybe google all blacks this is new zealands national team and the ones who made the haka famous believe me they will make italian sandwich the highlands boys look like school girls
1,not all but most of this bountiful story is buster being deplorable mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute film is tranquilize basically one adventure after deoxyadenosine monophosphate the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats serve racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund salmon p chase cop and father a girl buster is similar interested in former who chases him those latter scenes were the best i buster keaton thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel multitude elevator be where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half robert hour that makes little sense but cares its dude buster at his slapstick best or near dude it and so it later on serves its purpose to entertain us just think years lift after this film police officer was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
1,why does this have such a low rating i really dont get it is it because of the bad acting the bad dialogue well who cares about these things in cheesy lowbudget horror movies seriously the acting and the dialogue isnt important in those movies people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldnt be allowed to rate cheesy lowbudget movies those movies shouldnt be taken seriously periodanyway time to talk about the movie right well i loved it i bought it because i expected a gorefest but its not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad most of the time its just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and thats lame but i didnt really care because the movie is hilarious the characters are hilarious the acting is hilarious bad acting is a good thing in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the dialogue is hilarious bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on but i dont want to say too much but i have to mention that theres a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like its alive lol oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lolbest lines in the moviedetective manners sniffs coke detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners what the hell did you snort what the hell is that detective manners its nothing man its ehh cold medicinedetective manners injects heroin in his arm detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners are you beep insane detective manners its cold medicinedetective manners repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face detective sloane what the hells going on manners what are you doing detective manners this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock he just started smashing his head on the rock i think hes on pcp or somethinglol
0,irwin allen was great all of his tv shows had a great pilot or first episode the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows a few episodes of swiss family robinson were rip offs of his older tv shows one episode of swiss family is identical to an episode of land of the giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation the show was high budget and too expensive to continue irwin lost his touch with tv shows after the s the acting is strong with martin milner child stars got there starts with this show like willie ames and helen hunt one bright spot is when irwin allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the master of disaster

0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is bit creaky for any genuine film is set a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being vampirism the suspicious locals there a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this compounded the introduction of lionel atwills niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having on batloving village simpleton dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they onethis is one of trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and wray costarred x and the mystery of the museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken context though the vampire bat is still weak and we are left is a imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans for the title film would to even be considered as a and it is worth noting that director strayer was doing the blondie a few years later
0,three is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie masquerading as a psychological thriller its closest relative is the monumentally superior dead calm also featuring billy zane dead calm provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole kidmans grieving parents attempting to redefine their relationship on an ocean cruise they end up being terrorised by zanes adrift psychokiller it provided sharp increasingly ratcheted suspense a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfoldedthree suffers from poorly drawn characterisation the audience doesnt care what happens to any of them a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding hammy performances from the principal players zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion in dead calm he was menacing wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence here he is bombastic petulant slimy and unravelled and where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year ms brook is very picturesque stunningly pretty but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly overinflated by some sort of liferaft pump they do however succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her dramatic actress in the purest sense of the term she is not the guy playing the voodoohexed manuel the third component of this sorry triangle could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood no one would notice in fact judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes excuse punplus sides the scenery is nice and the cinematography above and below the water is credibleim guessing this had a very limited if any theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail dvd the reason for this is its not very good if you want something decent along these lines get dead calm it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema

0,even by standards of moviemaking the setup which her cardboard lover presents was dated to the extreme the machinations of one half of a pair of husbandwife exhusbandexwife to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another divorce or an eventual separation by means of jealousy humiliation or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as his girl friday and the philadelphia story both of these movies features women with a strong indomitable screen presence and who played independent protofeminist characters in both movies both women were estrangeddivorced from their witty first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soontobe husbands and reigniting their passion for each otherthe plot in her cardboard lover switches the gender here its norma shearer in the cary grant role out this time to ward off an exboyfriend george sanders by means of hiring robert taylor to pose as her gigolo the problem is shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her midtolate twenties sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most any man who would be in love with his fiance on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene not here and robert taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel cary grant half the time not in speech inflections but in overall essencebut the worst part of it is shearer herself for an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence playing consuelo craydon seems to put her into throes of complete overacting overemoting and overgesturing which while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge it only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives irving thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of most of her roles why she passed on roles such as charlotte vale and mrs miniver on megahits now voyager and mrs miniver is a mystery but then again most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting that shed had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and its no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and cant wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible such could be the case here she seems lost she seems tired she seems ill at ease going through autopilot instead of living the part after this film she would make no more but would be responsible of discovering janet leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late s and into the s
1,ok so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid however i think there can never be too many movies like the first karate kid theres something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself in this movie hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of hernot to say this movie is not without its problems unlike the first one mr miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life and doesnt really explain why they do what they do in the plotline the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly hateable bad guys i also have a suspicion about martial arts movies that end on prom nightso maybe this isnt a perfect movie so maybe this wouldnt be the greatest movie to rent on a friday night however in more ways than one its a guilty pleasure hillary swank is just so loveable and the story even though unoriginal works in a genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence this is a breath of fresh air unlike all those steven seagal and jean claude vandamme this is a movie about the spirit and the heart there are some people that need movies like this and well take whatever we can get my rating
1,it has started quietly if your are looking for an actionpacked movie this is absolutely not the right choice all characters are slowly depicted on the scene stroke after stroke on the scene canvas none can take away his hands to the priest and so the sisters lifespan devotion can only remain into the village philippa and martina know their destiny belong only to the village so when you understand that you are on the movie scene in the village that becomes the whole known world in that time when no technology can let you imagine anything else than the campaign the village the sea you feel the rhythm of that ancient villages life watching the movie in a cold snowy late afternoon can cause you to approach this evening dinner with some sumptuous expectations the final sentence that give a title to babettes sacrifice far from paris an artist is never poorsuperb photography many situations depict portraits and landscapes as they were styled on canvas there in jutland in th century
1,i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous although a musical i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well as far as her dancing i think she was excellent even betty grable pretty much endorsed ritas dancing in this film as she commented that rita danced rings around her own dancing and lets face it betty grable was an excellent dancer the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but shes also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever youll have to watch the film to find out
0,when the young kevin gets the boat of his dead uncle as a gift he invites five friends of him to a trip to catalina island for the weekend while in the journey they drink booze have sex and play games with each one of them telling his or her greatest fear later kevin drowns in the open sea the engine stops and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest innermost fearyesterday my wife son daughter and three other friends joined to watch haunted boat on dvd with less than minutes running time the group gave up watching this messy and boring amateurish piece of crap and we decided to see another film later i decided to watch the rest of this flick to see how bad it could be and it would have been better off going to bed to sleep the confused story has an awful cinematography and camera work with a cast that is probably studying to be actors and actresses and in the end this film seems to be a bad project of cinema school the terrible and pretentious screenplay shows a ridiculous twist in the end actually a complete mess that made me not understand what the story is all about was the girl insane and traveled alone in the boat imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends if that is true are their friend again in the very end fruit of her madness my vote is onetitle brazil viagem para a morte trip to the death
0,carlos wants to make fun of affirmative action racial stereotypes and related topics on his show which makes him a lot like supreme court justice thomas hes there because of his race and then denigrates it he can supposedly make fun of mexicans to no end because he is himself mexican and i would also contend he can get away with making fun of the mentally challenged because any lay person can tell hes not the sharpest toolthough he is definitely a tool of some sort he is a hack comedian who even with a staff of writers cant put together minutes of genuinely funny material in a minute show i cant think of a single comedian who is regularly on tv that carlos can hold a candle to except maybe larry the cable guy not too surprisingly he also has a show on comedy central to cater to the exact same audience no doubtif you ever see the greats jerry seinfeld chris rock jon stewart etc talk about comedy you really get a feeling for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a funny interesting comedic voice all that work was completely skipped by mencia his comedic voice is in part stolen from other better comics and in part hidden by his propensity for yelling his unfunny rehashed racist tripe mencias show is beloved by some of the at least i dont suck that badly crowd who i firmly believe watch it to feel better from his rants about the dumbing down of society unfortunately carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on that topic
0,some spoilers a soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it when charlotte and veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful low key truly erotic scene i also loved the music score and the soft muted cinematography im not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying my biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life of course she has to be shown as a sexworker what else scatterbrained impractical absurdly frillygirly completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world moreover shes always shown with two days growth of beard for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is and shes waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning in truth the character resembles a drag queen not someone in the midst of transitioningthese are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really arent connected to transpeople the films fetishization of grs surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least at the very least why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender i thought the male actor portraying veronica was okay but no better than that much better was the woman portraying charlotte a very complex character full of energy selfloathing desire and contradictions if she was so fascinated by someone with female energy a charlotte could go out to a womens bar in two seconds and find it yes she was drawn to veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with malefemale characteristics a gentle touch but with a good punch not as a unique person yes what a soap says about love is often lovely and moving but that doesnt mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the processthis film also proves that danes are lousy dancers for such a promising premise better executed in a film like different for girls the final film is a letdown
1,oh man why six degrees is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone if focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actionswhen i first heard of this show it didnt caught my attention at all it seemed too ordinary actually then i saw some episodes and loved it first of all the characters they are all wellwritten and different from each other theres a alcohol addicted a woman whose fiance cheats on her a woman who just lost her husband a driver who has a troubled brother and so on unlike what were used to most of the characters interact with each other in casualties like in our daily routines great my favourite ones are mae carlos and whitneythen the cast they are all great jay hernandez from hostel shows here his acting habilities in a more d character than his previous work as paxton the other ones give great performances too specially campbell scott who plays steven and bridget moynahan who plays whitneywell when i came to imdb after watching some episodes i couldnt believe that it got cancelled seriously i cant understand the low ratingsits too bad it didnt have more than one season it would really be a good show to follow
1,ok so this film may not have won any oscars but it is not a bad film the original doa is undoubtedly a better film but that does not mean this film is badthe film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after the right stuff made him a star and a very lovely looking meg ryan when she was still now quite famousthis is more of an update of the film rather than a remake since the setting is different and the characters too are different the plot is pretty much the same a man this time an english professor at the university of texas at austin is poisoned and he has only hours to find out who poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him jane kaczmarek plays quaids estranged wife in a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in daniel stern also in an early role before home alone made him famous plays quaids colleague charlotte rampling is fine too in a supporting rolethe entire cast is top notch the film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film

1,if your a hard core freddy fan then you might not like it this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series not much to see here the only reason it holds it self up is the back story on freddythe one thing that is always great in nightmare movies are the death scenes but the death scenes were very crappy in this the visual effects were great and the acting was ok but the back story was excellent basically freddys story comes full circle in thisi have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws a nightmare on elm street freddys dead the final nightmare a nightmare on elm street the dream master a nightmare on elm street the dream warriors a nightmare on elm street the dream child a nightmare on elm street freddys revenge i recommend it if you enjoy the series this is were freddy is fully explained but thats all there is next on my list wes cravens new nightmare
0,the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the daythis would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft windowi am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problemah a response trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data id say is a charming but weak and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by us government that the moonmissions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say youll see things a bit different than beforefirst off weather data doesnt come from nasa it comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims
1,recap based on the true story of charlie wilson an american congressman who according to this movie was instrumental in usas covert war in afghanistan against the soviet unioncomments a rather funny movie about not so funny things especially since they were real but focusing on the movie hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing congressman with a good heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in afghanistan hanks and the entire movie philip seymor hoffman especially has a rather humorous tone so much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate but the story that it tell and maybe the ending the most are serious indeeda story of what happened with some questions about what might have been so the movie works as a comedy if you want one and a much more serious one if you want that something for everybody
1,i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector in fact they double took me a few times so its hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon cheryl lockett alexander leesville louisiana i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector in fact they double took me a few times so its hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon cheryl lockett alexanderleesville louisiana
0,i saw this film opening weekend heath australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the definitive story of ned please would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance of in ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thinwhich doesnt inspire producers to to our it there me some other plus points the support assured from edgerton in particular acting direction from jordan confirming his opportunity on show in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave just real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the australian immigrants the the early th century must have seen sunshine but i cant that were help another feeling has been missed to kelly the real story of an irish folk hero or was hein what history suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and by myself didnt agree read lose the beards a to kelly universalguess i will just have to content talent with peter careys excellent secret i of the tell gang
0,i watched this movie as i liked the plot a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how theyre connectedthe setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first and best saw movie although there wasnt much action the story moved at a relatively good pacethere was comedy relief ion the form of the two bickering alpha males and it was a welcome surprise for me anywayto see melissa joan hart hasnt given up on acting yeta few things let it down for me personally the paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodies mjhs line about her cop ex getting her into this when in reality he was the least deserving person to be there he hadnt knowingly contributed to the events leading up to their capture the ending what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on there was no resolution no cliff hanger no obvious end it just endsand for that alone i dropped two stars off my rating the first points i would let slide but not the end
0,i heard so about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early s that die hard fans of most slasher movies just to see well i rented it and i have to say that it kept my attention as as the suspense goes most slasher such as april day friday th and prom night this film could have been up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well the on going story characters that found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of leading up to his true climatic role the end with he faces killer another be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jacket he have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this as another loser out making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the which a waste i was disappointed his part in end as far as the true identity of the killer goes when the identity was released to who was i just laughed but it was all to obvious and he really made true out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but dont spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory
1,the story line for this game is very jerky where it appears the game writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in tales of the soul that being said this is the only gripe i have about the attempt gamethe beginning fmv is spectacular research with breath taking sceneries merely steel and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your job own persona correction character and their own martial arts discipline theres novel even a second story mode which follow makes up for the awkward story design of story tale of the soulsparts of the fmvs during tale of the souls is also interactive where you can decide the fate of your persona character to a certain degree which is an interesting featurewith the many combinations of deoxyadenosine monophosphate characters you can create the varied paths be you associate in nursing can explore in tales of the wide ranging souls and the chronicle of swords story mode this game will keep any beatem uprpg fans amused for follow a while
1,i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the s and s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him a liberal westerner canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in leading to the largest write in campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she costarred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest

0,the old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in women in love the script taken from d h lawrences novel contains an endless flow of concepts that are at best sophomoricwhat a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise what an empty array of characters given such attention in spite of high production values this film comes across as tedious as its personnela revisit in merely confirms a impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies dawdling nowhere and fumbling every step of the way
0,i spotted the dvd on a store near my home and since im a cheesy horror moviealien flicks addict i wondered how good it was it even had two award mentions on the cover i dont remember what festival it won so i figured hey this might be good so i bought it for five euros and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews here either people bashed the movie to say it was bad or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla bla i then played the dvd not thinking about any review i had read with an open mind and not expecting anything at allman i dont like being this critical but the movie was genuinely bad ok im just going to give out some pointers of what i thought actingdialog the acting was so confusing sometimes the actors did a decent job but there were scenes were i could spot no effort at all from them the dialog was even worst i think it was probably the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie the talking in between characters seemed off not just bad but far away from the actual happenings in the movie the monologues of the female character although well delivered became boring and annoying in a little while but of course the most ridiculous aspect was the aliens or the infected i wont even comment on that one just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture visuals the strongest aspect in the movie if you forget the awful fx and light flashes they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be the camera in car aspect was quite cool actually but they didnt even used the environment to inspire fear or dread they left that to cheap sound and video fx and the three infected characters the movie becomes boring in so many scenes sound talk about editing this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was from computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the alien dialog ahso what did i like in the movie spoilers the only thing i really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot somethingsomeone walking in a distant at first i really thought it was me seeing things but when the character realizes that the figures coming towards her were her own reflection i was surprised pretty creepy idea done well apart from that i had an awful timeand i dont recommend this to anyone not even teen get together because you cant even laugh at thisi give it a solid only some technical achievements worked here apart from that yeah nothing

0,i must say that i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl fans i find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know theyve had better moments as in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan hes the man in charge my names steve paige and im really large bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull blue song by effeil or whatever every minutes i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is like that years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play if i had a million dollars bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull then all of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah theyre brand new but theyre all in their s while the rest of canada is going oh geez i thought those guys folded years ago do i have to listen to million dollars againthe concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think theyre all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it the interviews with moses znaimer a canadian media mogule and terry david mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionallythis movie doesnt really document very much either i mean its basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage its not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the end its rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either
0,i have been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters and the star trek universe in general even in the undiscovered country i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release however having said that star trek v the final frontier is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew i agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk spock and mccoy is well handled but the overall script the direction by william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode this is a buddy movie and at times almost unrecognizable as a star trek movie the action sequences are not sustained and therefore build little or no tension the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs both intended and notintended the klingons seem thrown in as an afterthought the whole shakaree concept is just silly and laurence luckinbill a fine actor in everything else ive ever seen him in boarders on the absurd in this movie the scene where sybok conjures up images of spocks pain and mccoys pain shatters the image of the characters as weve known them spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy trying to save his father is full of insipid redundant dialogue and totally wastes deforest kelleys acting abilities the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters i understand that shatner didnt have the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight but that doesnt allow for such a bad story in some respects i think this story does fit in with the old series but the movies including star trek the motion picture are all much better quality than this its a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie the focus on kirk mccoy and spock is nice but way over used the old crew really seems to be out of character i liked the old klingon general and the sultry romulan in the bar i liked some of the humor and the idea that spock has a halfbrother but thats about it if this was a tv episode id be able to accept a lot of the faults as a movie this is just bad uninspired film making its a shame too because i want this movie to be good even if it was the level of star trek iii i would be happy but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare
0,let freedom ring was probably made with the best of intentions but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final productthe folks at a western town where the railroad is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers working on the railroad being financed by robber baron edward arnold there are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroads path and these folks are dealt with summarily by arnolds hired men one man who wont give in is lionel barrymore whose son is coming home from harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the ranchers causeonly nelson eddy decides the best way to fight is to go zorro on the bad guys but other than charles butterworth no one knows hes the wasp a very interesting choice of names by the way what arnolds done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east getting the immigrants to vote nelsons idea is simple if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy arnold is theyll vote with the original settlers and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst he kidnaps newspaper editor raymond walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributedthe railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants not the irish working west or the chinese working east as history has it its a real united nations working on arnolds railroad the workers are kept in line by foreman victor mclaglen and nelson has the unenviable task of beating some sense into him like john wayne did in the quiet manof all the films that starred jeanette and nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo this was the worst of what they did at mgm nelson is about to be hanged along with barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best but certainly nothing worth being hung for and virginia bruce who plays the nelsons girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of my country tis of thee that the immigrants join in with in the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters arnold quite rationally packs up and leaves town to build his railroad somewhere elsei kid you not thats the ending here just what is the message vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with arnold but somehow youll get by here i do wonder some times if years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some towns where the railroad has come through that are now cities that the good citizens of that town havent rethought about what nelson eddy did if they did theyre probably running him out on a railnelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by sigmund romberg where else but here the song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country too bad it didnt have a better venuethe almost platinum blonde virginia bruce im sure is dubbed here and im sure jeanette macdonald was just as happy she wasnt accompanying nelson on this trip west
0,dont let the name of this film deceive you in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film when jake speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen which he is often not hes seriously relaxing perhaps this adds to his charm but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to chill out whenever he gets the chance furthermore unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents this man has none unless of course you call sleeping a talent anyhow this movie is basically worthless the writing is sub par and the action when there is some is very lame the machine guns on the jeep werent bad but thats about it so if youre in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia then this piece is perfect for you it has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep but also his audience
1,the di outta stars wow terrific certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie a much as i did i a never movie heard of it followed i saw it sitting in the discount pale bin one day i in jack webb playing an army gentleman instructor kick be good for as chuckle but figured the drama would video in comparison to such recent it dis as portrayed in full metal jacket or an private and interlude drill boy was i wrong this hes probably the best work webb has ever done far and patented better than his onenote dragnet performances the delivery every his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant done in his away by had and yet you know that little guy means of word of even the story might seem a the hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have until but i still found a movie fascinating the compelling even the completely unnecessarily musical had in an army nightclub monotone me hooked anyone know where i can get a copy of that instructor ray coniff song ifn you dont somebody else will webb plays the and dang drill i ever and buried under pressure to might out toughest deadbeat officer owen but deadpan golly he sees a man hes somewhere figured that sissyboy and is gonna drag him out kicking and screaming great stuff
1,this time around blackadder is no longer royalor even particularly close to being any such thing instead rather a butler to the prince regent portrayed by hugh lauriewho replaces tim mcinnerny who presence is sorely missed and that hole is never filled his character had an innocent charm while he was a bumbling and complete moron we cant help but care for him which isnt at all true of his replacement as being intolerably daftwhich he apparently was according to the trivia page not to mention loudmouthed and utterly nonthreatening edmund can now do just about what he pleases and does so why is he so frustrated and angryhonestly it gets depressing at times yes his master is a buffoon they always are he doesnt seem to lack money nor is he in any danger in the second series the queen was mischievous and childish and would cut off someones head or marry them on a whim here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting there is still commentary and even a little satire too often it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own so they merely restate it not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags and i cant tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done literally more than a minute away its not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered baldrick doesnt change from last season hes still rather pathetic and stupid leading to silly humor frankly the amount goes through the roof dont get me started on the grossout stuff the sarcastic verbal wit can still be great though much less of it is than before id say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny while the other three didnt really get me into them at all i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were i could see many of such coming a mile away some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition started by ii of letting the plans work out occasionally the theme is the worst of the bunch the credits sequences the least creative all in all this is by far my least favorite of the four i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general

0,ty cobb is by thither imbibe far the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live his baseball knocked out career was pitilessness unparalleled in absurd statistics brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence every game indeed he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty so of course the film about him deals with none thither of that instead focusing focalisation on the writing of measure acetum his biography by author al stump now consummate this isnt such a horrible idea in theory as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories unneeded of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by todays numeration desensitized standards but instead of own focusing on these events poor people which i guess was simply too interesting the film is author a pseudo fictionalized road film episode with clichd a clichd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb but somehow manages to helium overplay his cartoon supervillainy most stories about cobb are barely believable but to master key make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary robert wuhl portraying the occupy writer al stump is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent he sucks the life out of every inwards scene trying to hostilely make this film his own nagasaki there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore arliss conventionalize doesnt appear count its barely a show even the played out inevitable role reversal of cobb and stump by the end be is made mad even worse by his pure inability to utter words that dont sound a like a poor book on tape saturated narration voice for all the awful writing and bland filmmaking on display there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior burst to master key the rest of this present failure that accepting its from the same film is near impossible former armed forces a hyper stylized flashback sequence military man displaying cobbs overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of indeed baseball is today pure brilliance the camera moves in bizarre fashion and fifty fifty the be whole event seems live on like a dream due to helium the unique playing nonstarter style of the monster cobb every exhibit slide hit and tackle are rendered master key even more forceful due to enhanced sound and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the convolution master player it makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same actor its worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone just indeed to see what could have been i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb lake superior and wanting it to be something it isnt but to make such boring neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical im glad ron sheltons career ambo has slid ever since
1,this was such a great film it was done with such beautiful design such symmetry i love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth space and beyond it was such a fluent and thought provoking masterpiece i loved the way the monoliths never changed although primate earth and space did i loved how it was a question of do you need meus now the movie expressed desire peace love curiosity finesse gentleness courage and innocence what more could you ask for from a mere movie perhaps a complement movie any appreciator of a space odyssey will find the movie is s complement movie is more story orientated than

1,like a few people i know i came in late on istingers not until three years later there is no way id miss an episode the show really is that good and has for a better word maintained its integrity unlike blue heelers for example the crime is the thing personal lives are there but only wheeled arrive out when affecting an investigation when gary sweet was brought in some fans seemed worried but hes really fitted in well which didnt surprise me gary could measure up to any british or us actor in advantageously a merely similar series the cast changes occasionally but each change brings something associate in nursing new and fresh rest with arguably standardized fine australias finest crew behind the come scenes wheel around istingers will continue to investigating remain a view cutting edge drama series

0,this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great for sure pandemonium and in spite of appearance world are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense but i found pandemonium more enjoyable because it was fast paced rather like the silly picture show xiphias gladius the reason this picture show is more pop is because this got released in the states and pandemonium was aired all around the world at picture show festivals and foreign theaters but has til now to find a distributor in the great britain and usa its on key that this picture show makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day good afternoon and other spike lee films but that doesnt mean value that it is a pleasant picture show to watch watch it if nothing else is on tv but youll probably get bored with after awhile
0,one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins one of the most serious examples in th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of goldbearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the s to the early s this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult thus the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten color film by warnerfirst we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor a very rare treatment in a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldnt seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations then we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero to be paired with olivia de havilland among other things this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it even the usually colorful gabby hayes in his small role seemed unusually subdued unfortunately i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems it needed to be more like the good earth released just the year before just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man such as errol flynn finally there is the matter of the inane title surely warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title gold or grain is short and to the point incidentally i understand there is still plenty of gold in them thar hills waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining
0,who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordons legendary bad trashfilm food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late s location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the s this script hangs together by clichs awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growingexperiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielbergs jaws started theres an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new sport complex gnaw food of the gods is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know its infested with rats the acting is atrocious and theres a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growthserum i wonder what freuds theory would be on that theres a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and it has to be said the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just cant get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creaturefeatures revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest s cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent ratmovies by oncefamous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts

0,right this moment am watching this movie on tv here in tokyo beautiful scenery beautiful sets of biblical proportions beautiful costumes beautiful color gina great climactic scene when god the sheban idol and lot more with de millean thunderbolts at the moment when yul and gina are about to consummate their love yul does a halfway decent job of his lines though he sounds a lot yul delivering his lines as ramses taras bulba george sanders sounds george sanders playing george sanders given limited range acting she is asked to display in this role gina does a good job by the time the movie ends she is completely converted into a demure remorseful lass and looks likes might be playing in biography of mother teresa i guess thunderbolts will do that to you but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her new religion the supporting players are awful emotion and timing the usual big battle what passed for lascivious dances in and an blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of ahs but none of it quite of hollywood quality the final swordfight between brynner and sanders at the laughingly low skill level of a junior high school play the film is one big of eye candy but not more
0,the key scene in rodrigo garcias nine lives comes when sissy spacek hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with aiden quinn find a nature documentary on television at which point quinn notes the contrivance of such thingsdisparate footage is edited into one scene predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the momentall to force connections where none actually exist characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories but none of them ever seem to really connect a woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy a man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later hosts with his current wife a dinner party for an unhappy couple garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came beforegarcias first film the wonderful overlooked things you can tell just by looking at her also had a shortstory structure and overlapping characters but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow the gimmicky premise of nine lives that each of its nine stories is told in a single unbroken take in real time never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum its also a fairly visually ugly movie interior shots are often murky and hard to watch while other scenesparticularly one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parentsare rendered annoying by the camerawork given that this is garcias third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish like fellow filmmakerchildofagreatwriter rebecca miller garcia son of gabriel garcia marquez is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the detriment of the filmmaking onesindividual scenes are touching and even affecting i did like jason issacs kissing robin wright penns pregnant belly and joe mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife as she slips into presurgery sedation and sissy spacek stealing a few happy moments away from her life with aiden quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter but the film unlike things you can tell just by looking at her feels more like an exercise than actual drama we are just watching people act
1,zero day is based of columbine high school massacre and its a video diary of two boys at first you dont know whats going to happen you think it is just a bad student film until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and going shooting in the woods they is a lot to say about this movie all know this film is well a film you forget you watching a film and watching a real video two boys madethe two boys act like they are in a weird cult they burn all there stuff like play station games books dvds homework stuff school stuff these two boys can be anybody your friends you brothers or the people you see walking down the street it goes through there daily actives and that is making a gun in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people said stuff about there clothes and the things you are into im not saying its right but many people do do things like thatand also the thing is with this people are suspected to like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen on this filmso thats my review on zero dayand lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up
1,this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they werent very funny and had a drama element where bill the mother was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didnt mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the bbc have ever made the chemistry between bill and bens characters were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series the christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for christmas the show came to a stop when the main actor gary olsen playing bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as up n under and a very funny man ripthis underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesnt to be repeated that often though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while but it should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
1,lolthe mere fact that i start off my review with lol says it all i used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and even then i sensed the silliness of it all the low budget horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then i watched it again yesterday and just couldnt stop laughing its so bad its actually good lol like another reviewer said it doesnt take itself seriously theres no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so the soundtrack is so funny i laugh every time i hear it the climax is just a laugh riot its an all out war zone in new york full of explosions and total chaosso ridiculous you cant help but chuckle at the sight of it other hilarious moments the scene with kersey and the cop running side by side like cowboys against the whole wild west was so cheesy it was funnyit killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking eversocareful and slow aim and not get hit lmao of course with him it was one shotone kill with his elephant handgun lol another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gangwith a rocket launcher loldestroying the whole side of the apartment building with it its apparent that kersey is all but used to losing loved oneswhen his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates the acting is so bad that you cant blame anyone that could only think that kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lolhe runs down looks at the carnage and just walks awayagain so bad its good out of stars
0,arnold fans will holler in joy fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment and catholics will just hollerillogically written by andrew w marlowe and hamhandedly directed by peter hyams end of days gets the terminator out of his openbacked hospital gown arnold schwarzeneggers return to the big screen after his heart operation whilst blowing things up in mysterious ways and blaspheming biblical verse to give catholics something more to whine aboutit is and doomsayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn even as the technological stank of y k muttons the new york streets excop turned alcoholic security guard jericho cane schwarzenegger with the perfunctory deadwifeandkid backstory for loose cannon effect must brave theological waters to save yearold virgin christine robin tunney from being conscripted as wait for it the bride of satan dun dah daaaarrrh stupidity ensuesfor every antihero there is his antichrist gabriel byrne is the devil here and hes out to party like its on a mission to impregnate christine with the antichrist between pm and midnight december ironically in the hour that all porn will be lost thereby bringing about the end of days being able to read minds conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic it doesnt occur to satan to expedite the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time instead he appears on december th like a keyser soze terminator and wonders why she doesnt welcome him with open thighs see above comment re stupidity here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology a priest rod steiger tells jericho that is really upside down with a in front of it so wait prince is the antichristsatan soze pursues jericho and christine j and c get it around town at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture in one scene satan recreates jerichos wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid christine but if he can see so deeply into jerichos mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia why cant he see where jericho hid christine not ten minutes ago satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue yet he cant make that assassin unjam a semiautomatic weapon and when jericho shoots satan at point blank range satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing so jericho wont worry unduly about satans health not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds matter of fact instead of simply possessing jericho himself to get close to christine and rape her satan expends so much unnecessary energy on sideprojects crucifying the tongueless guy blowing up jerichos partner kevin pollak and then saving him and then blowing him up again ridiculously battling jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought that we wonder whether a more efficient assassinlover shouldnt be put on the case say antonio banderaswhat i find most precious about end of days is arnolds valiant attempts at the method sad means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent depressed means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent deathly scared means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent theres definitely a pattern here if we could only decipher itin the end the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these but from the atheist jericho while the timid men of an impotent god exhort faith and quiver in their cells doing nothing about satan actually walking amongst them the prince of darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent which clearly says something that catholics blindly refuse to hear that even if the devil were to exist those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall let alone act towards it further they might not truly want him defeated for only through his contrary polarity does their gods existence become tenablefor it is written in the book of revelations and the prince of darkness shall descendeth upon the earth without any solid game plan and impregnate a virgin on a date which wont have any significance until the gregorian calendar of the s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the anno domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia by which time christians will have forgotten christs actual birth date and appropriated the pagan saturnalia festival in its stead and the prince shall effect a revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguouslylesbian band members i can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified and the alcoholic built like a mr universe i can believe that a giant supernatural monster cant kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent i can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century celtic druid ritual as foreplay but what i cannot believe is the yearold virgin in new york city in especially around prince

1,this is not a movie that i would typically watch at in the morning but i got into it and couldnt stop until it was overshia labeouf demonstrated that he is not just a young actor here but could handle more demanding roles the fact that he has been handed those roles in the last two years is testament to his abilityit was really his movie sure there were others involved but they pale in comparison to his rolethis was a time when gold was reserved for the privileged this victory opened it up to the masses much the way that tiger woods has opened golf to all raceslike harry vardon stephen dillane said to lord northcliffe peter firth if mr ouimet shia labeouf wins tomorrow its because hes the best because of who he is not who his father was not how much money hes got because of who he bloody is and ill thank you to remember that go get charged up

1,i just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it the synopsis was listed in our program as an old shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party i wasnt sure if i was going to see it because when i read about it i liked the idea of a suicide party it sounded very interesting to me but old shakespearean actor had me worried that the film would be kind of dry and boring but i decided to give it a try i am glad that i did it was not dry and boring in the least that dialogue was great funny in a clever way but not pretentious and difficult to understand peter falk was terrific in this role he stole the show i also was pleasantly surprised by laura san giacomos performance usually she bugs me but i enjoyed watching her in this film very much i think judge reinholds part could have been done better by another actor at times he seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting not like you were just watching this character but the movie was so good i was able to forgive one actors awkwardness i would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public who knew suicide could be so hilarious

1,this solid black and white slapstick comedy with urge a dark but hopelessly contrived plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter as well as rolling your eyes with disbeliefits the old psychopath heart contrive on a train story but that is sociopath of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to school be merely affirmative a counterweight to the antics of narrative the great comedian robert gustafsson his hapless nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chasethe thing about impulse the film that appealed to me the most however is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the be accurately portrayed counterpose everyday joys and nuisances of train travel tremendous they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognitionthis thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its suspense from hitchcock and advantageously should in antic alfred hitchcock my opinion inwards only be watched for its comedy value which is high indeed besides gustafsson lars drollery ambles solid performance as invoke a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission aloneheartily recommend
0,once upon a time there was a great american film which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills this film featured clever direction groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting it was entitled an american werewolf in london sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original think again an american werewolf in paris is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish the problems begin with the leading man tom everett scotts performance is stiff and tiresome from the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons in his defense not even a seasoned shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue at one point one of scotts deceased friends whos soul is doomed to walk the earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves is finally able to leave for the afterlife he then quips to scott and his friends okay guys see ya what a memorable goodbye julie delphy soon shows up as scotts mysterious european love interest basically shes a french girl playing the french girl it isnt much of a stretch but all this stupidity isnt even the most disappointing thing about the film the special effects such an integral part of the superb original film fall far short in this flop the werewolves look like cartoons and no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles its still hard to get scared of a cartoon so instead the vacationing american gang led by the ultra weak scott keep finding excuses to return to the werewolfs catacombs lair here its much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness some have said that if you dont look on this film as a sequel its not as bad by comparison i disagree this film can not stand on its own and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original if it doesnt want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the film i dont care how much you love werewolves or how much you worshiped american werewolf in london as i myself did this one is simply not worth wasting your time okay guys see ya terrible out of a possible th

0,one of the serious potential environmental costs of most excavation operations is pollution of downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins one of the most serious examples in th hundred usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic excavation of goldbearing gravely hills on the sides of the capital of california vale in the period from the s to the early s this process involved directing a high pressure jet of ho onto the hillside causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the dumbfound and deposit the deposit then collected in a dump or stream and most found its way to the capital of california river or its tributaries the deposit that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of photoflood in the downstream agricultural w c fields and towns and create permanent reginald marsh in some country some of the deposit spilled over onto the agricultural w c fields where it might incubate a place upright harvest or incubate more desirable bemire or make address difficult thence the conflicting sake of the companies that used hydraulic excavation and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the study of this nearly forgotten color film by warnerfirst we might ask why warner decided to hit this film in a preferably poor technicolor a very rare intervention in a story about pale yellow farmers and gold miners wouldnt seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time the answer seems to be the unreasonable film time spent indoors with fancy coloured clothes and ornamentations then we might ask why colourless george brent goose was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero sandwich to be paired with olivia de havilland among other things this film really needed a magnetic leading man to carry it still the usually coloured gabby hayes in his little theatrical role seemed outstandingly subdued unfortunately i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last parting of the film the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically depict the plight of the chosen pale yellow baron and perhaps nearby township common people and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems it needed to be more like the good earth released just the year before just maybe it would then have been suitable for a magnetic leading man such as errol flynn lastly there is the matter of the inane title surely warner could have seed up with a tricky or more appropriate title gold or texture is short and to the point incidentally i understand there is still stack of gold in them thar hills waiting to be extracted by intend other than hydraulic excavation

0,it started out with an interesting premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best in the latter half it quickly became a c movie then d then f then i wish that this wasnt a rental so that i could put it in the microwave i cant say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the writing however i never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as a pound bag of fertilizer i really hated this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman

0,not being a particular fan victims westerns i watched this primarily because i wanted were question lucille ball in something other than an i love she or lucy the blow of role here she plays christine larson owner of a to in pretty arizona territory in whos about to be married to the unscrupulous get indian agent dean jagger balls performance was of with really more than that story didnt type me away it succeeded for me in pretty the role was very different from what im accustomed to seeing her in there was very a of up outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although show movie tried to the little gently amusing feel throughout a typical funny line theres two ways to deal nothing to and no one knows either one ok from if didnt find maintain lucy all that compelling although i appreciated that the indians saloon shown as the of of the planned agent genre typical shootout action and a lot of horses your typical western in other words the to christine we the much can guess them as beginning how her indian marriage is going women end the its be a see of how shes going to local there if typical like westerns this would be a that you one with a bit of humour thrown in i youre not big on the theres this will just lacking im not big on the genre
1,we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was born to play al pacino stars as new yorks mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this moviei understand that i cant name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays but thats not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to see also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and david paymer
0,the long list the big names in this flick set i ubiquitous john mills and bowl me over to the extent that i couldnt judge of film pretty its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures didnt then including scenes from the humble airace hero to the then yank flyer the music track was which that at one point about an standard before the end this thought the cannot was over loud the crescendo grand flourish and finish loudmouthed silence but hour the movie continued i found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniforms and the on jean simmons prenose job with a rousing little minor i film say that i picture has any of the ingredients such make a film great rising found it maudlin mawkish and ditty
