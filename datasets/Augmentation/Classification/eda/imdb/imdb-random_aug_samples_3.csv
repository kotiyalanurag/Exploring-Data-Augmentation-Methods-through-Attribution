0,loved batman series and was really looking forward to this but they tried to do too muchwhy they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover batmobile was beyond me i dont want to knock burt or for the way they nowits been years since they appeared at batman and robin but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting badguys was kinda sad i rather of just seen the exstars do commentary the batmobile side story was stupidas for the flashback movie i think it was short and left out way too much it was really just a quick overview my opinion id like more background they showed the and joker for about minute each just to tell the same i already knew the had under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even he hated it was an that was it on those id love read the book i am sure it more in that this why was there riddlers or why mister freezes where was commishioner gordon ohara alfred freeze king tut etc the list goes on like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in itvery disappointing and really corny

1,i remember seeing this film sept at the west end theater in louisville kentucky when i was a theatre of operations boy the scene indium where dr carmus finds the gardeners coffin and the breathing dead body therein was the scariest part of the movie for me only intensified by the darkness of the film in that respect physical object i also wondered about the cicily isabel fairfield people son necropolis hanging from the trees at cicily isabel fairfield the end until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name kick of the blackwoods was changed theatre of operations from blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by pic his family i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in astatine noticing the sharp object of casket the gate where he meets his detect end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers
1,one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema or indeed most anything done outside these holierthanthou united states are the permutations that crop up in postworld war two japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion the same thing happens in genre filmmaking as well though again im referring to movies made outside the u where were just too sophisticated in our closemindedness to appreciate anything that isnt about or by us would an american company for instance back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler el santo or a werewolf paul naschy or a reallife martial artist bruce lee as for television forget it while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine ive always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was how to put it kindly a bit lacking to this very day there hasnt been a payperview channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia there are lots of softcore porn masquerading as entertainment shows but the socalled action channel for instance has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc there was of all things at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery the deadly venoms in its own right as fascinating as any other genrebased whodunit western cop show etc this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work its now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve if youre a martial arts movie fan rejoice one of the greatest movie genres of all time specifically the martial arts movies of the s and early s are getting a longoverdue second life and greatly appreciated second look on dvd

0,i saw this film at its new yorks high falls film festival screening well and i must that i it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the in some places was dreadful and especially lovely lady and the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a lot to be desired jcmac was i felt the redeeming feature of this film true action and grit and out of the cast the only real acting i sure with another cast and a reign on the directing this could been half decent film let us just that it is not sent on general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in lidl
0,id never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is more entertaining than this s era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high octane cop shows such as csi csi miami and so forth im not saying all these shows are bad but they arent good either i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypescountertypes thats right stereotypescountertypes unfortunately this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in gothpunk clothing and they start harassing him now this is exactly what middle america perceives the gothpunk culture i mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot its always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood okay not everyone whos a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what middle red state america sees of these people finally why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick cant you make the sidekick an equal asskicker
1,i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandys bodacious bod if you dont expect anything else such as clever plot twists and believable character development you wont be disappointed consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who threaten to come between her and her mommy suzanna arquette who obviously doesnt want to play the sex kitten she leaves that up to her daughtermandys face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a perfect to ratio of waist to hips and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratioand no flat butt to boot which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the nether hemispheres mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candlelit hot tub with her blindfolded germanguy victim no but from all i could see from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didnt need a double to prove itmandys acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic mommys girl with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no who also happened to be her mothers lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise onedimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reasonmandys ubernordic facial features coupled with her ubervoluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress id advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages especially italian and spanish and maybe french although i dont know if they would go for her type but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the s whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the groundvambo drule
1,with a film starring the twins ekin cheng edison nobody should masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of hollywoodstyle vampires no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment jackie chansure the kungfu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure script reminds you of blade sure whole affair is instantly forgettablebut a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic you would be hard pushed to find
0,a badness movie about a badness movie is that original or what if it is then thats the only good matter about it the lovely ally sheedy couldnt stop this bomb from destroying movie theaters and vcr everywhere it should as well be noted that she and the other actors hired by danny aiellos character were billed as themselves as well as the characters they played in his drated take cry it a brated take is too a good deal of a compliment and would moderate to delusions of grandeur
1,better than the typical madefortv movie invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting urich lucci cassidy mccarthy premurphy brown joe regalbuto soleil moonfrye and a high construct update to the familiar faustian plot urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly bring in and madly over the cover in the engender of all femme fatale roles kind of a hybrid variation of stepford wives and they live the movie devote early to its apocalyptic miltonesque imaginativeness and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the mawkish maudlin denoument
0,this movie started out as a quite decentlooking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didnt manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all its supposed to be a horror movie but there wasnt a single scene that was close to frightening or even excitingto be frank the actors werent all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysoverall a watchable movie but it doesnt add anything and once youve finished watching it it wont last long until its already forgottenthe reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it out of if you still want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch juon instead

0,this movie was probably ace of the worst movies ive get wind in a very farseeing time a admirer of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply rue ehh where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked quite an possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialogue was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies blatant dialogue such as how ya doingnot that great doc directly after an attempted exorcism of a homo girl and then his wifes attempted suicide of course hes not that great was at some points kind of funny if not awfully written planned out and obvious the universal plot of the movie the writing and the style it worked frightful it was alike the writers could come up with nix respectable to do then write a clump of crappy dialogue and throw in as many excite and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good excite prospect between the preacher and the tattooed peirced girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more alike a garish porno than a feature film oh yea and they never actually got the deed donethe acting frightful x i think the only good thespian was the short spanish guy who toy miguel del zamora and his part was written awfully the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with crappy music a gun and a half naked blueish lily white girl running just about in the woods take a crap the movie almost unendurable to sit around through he even screwed up his own decease prospect ace that should have been easy to boom although most everybody elses acting was frightful as wellthe lack of eccentric as well added to the overall suck tear down of the movie there were just enough eccentric so that almost half of the eccentric died that same amount of people go possessed at ace point and then the remaining eccentric couldnt be counted on ace hand alike thumbs downps what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways

1,unbelievably close to world health organization real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor a wannabe tough redneck played assistance to perfection by brad renfro although the story may seem slightly farfetched the two boys attempt to riverraft case several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have aspirant the cure to aids the emotion actions friendly relationship and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to sodding real life being a big brother to a boy in a similar eer disunite situation becharm who died a decease few sprightliness years after this film was released aspirant i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids superb direction by cracker peter horton assistance creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into sodding the various emotions affected by friendship illness prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to instruction overcome adversity

1,gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a trivialityand to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as dramabut i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years immensely sympathetic performance from jared harriss who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charismahopefully without poor richards penchant for hellraising and haminessand charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer radiant location photography including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to lifeand making magic in the dark

0,the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant them it in the hope that given a little time theyll convince you its possible alas with tv movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience not here though the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately its not enough to save the day oh and the less said about the ending the better happy filmviewing everyone

1,this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy but profane woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero sound familiar there are plenty of holes in this story things just dont add up and some of the suspense is a little corny but that suspense is very good there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it the story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way making it an involving movie for the viewer thats why i give it a pretty good rating the movie gets you involved in it bullock is more cute than annoying which she normally is to me so this is my highestrated movie with her in it

0,there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us translation the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is superbly grateful for what they have got the us translation of this show is everything that reality tv shouldnt be instead of making a few advance to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt i do not know if this show is taste to show what a lousy welfare system be in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive the rather plebeian product placement that ingest put in particular by char is also uncalled for rsther than turning one mob in a divest area into possible millionaire it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of one thousand of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perhaps a put where diy and power creature can be borrowed and returned along with building cloth so that everyone can welfare should they want to giving it all to one person can grounds tremendous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same tend down houses

1,the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and ive seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are what really made it for me cristina rainess father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine its your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think its one of the better ones out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfiedperformances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part shes beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldnt help but love him martin balsamjos ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli wallachchristopher wlaken do well as the bumbling detectives beverly dangelo has one chilling scene that i wont spoilbottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look
1,i think this film has much to recommend it particularly an especially sinister execution by david morse and a more than tolerable execution by the eer worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivating is very very hard to follow in some cases all in all it makes for a overnice time in front of the pipe
0,some of the secondary actors try really hard and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely otherwise this film is horriblewilliam shatners character harvey is an amateur screenwriter hes also a psychopath a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie even if that means taking a film crew hostage do amateur screenwriters grovel maybe they dothe films setup is way too long we dont get to the point of the story until well into the second half the first half darts and flits among assorted charactersshoot or be shot is touted as a comedy but i found it totally not funny dialogue contains no subtext none of the characters are believable as real people theyre all stick figures that perform action in a way that resembles cartoon characters indeed the film is basically a cartoon for adults silly inane birdbrainedi can understand why some actors are in this film they need the money or the exposure but what are insiders shatner and harry hamlin doing here maybe shatner wants more comedy roles is this the best he can do is hamlin that desperate for money he used to be a respected actor what happenedeven though the story is supposed to be a satire it comes across more as a putdown of amateur screenwriters maybe that wasnt the intent but thats certainly how the film can be interpreted as such the script was very very poorly written

1,i remember this film at the end theater in louisville kentucky when i was a boy the scene where dr carmus finds gardeners coffin and the breathing dead body therein was the scariest part of the movie for only intensified by the darkness of film also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end until i recognized part of the film in which the family name of the blackwoods was from blackblood due to the fact that in the history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of people sir thomas blackwood to get his kicks out of adding the deaths caused by his family i also noticed that as foster first enters gate of the cemetery he is careful in noticing the object of the gate where he meets his end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers
0,wow never before have i seen horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one in minutes then i happened to come upon frankenstein this movie takes everything you about frankenstein and turns it completely upside down and not in a good way if youve seen this movie either stumbled across it on italian tv or you have the dubbed version on the chilling classics box like have as number lets just theres a reason why these movies are here because theyre not very good enough though onto the movieit starts out with dr frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant whosobviously not igor for some reason his college graduate daughter shows up and states how she graduated with a medical degree cause yeah there were so many female doctors back then so she states how she wants to help her father with his work and says no and then he makes the monster and it kills him so she grieves for exactly and then makes up a story the assistant how it was a burglar the monster escapes and goes on rampage ok i really cant believe they killed dr frankenstein so early in the movie he dies like minutes in and his daughter takes over which doesnt make a whole lot of sense but sure so frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster whos now rampagingis to make another monster oh yes how i love her logic so her new monster she gets the body by killing someone and putting brain the assistant in iti know just nod and go along with it so the monsters meet duke it out i love how the assistant asks why dont we just let mobs kill it and she answers with they wouldnt know kill it and in the end he it with an axe to the head haha oh yeah nobody else could have that one out so in the end the brain switched monster kills lady frankenstein the endthis movie was justweird it was seriously like somebody wrote a insert fanfic theres no other way describe this movie there were some odd naked scenes too this girl having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend the monster picks up the girl and guy drives away haha nice guy she then struggles a bit and dies fromto be quite honest i really dont know what she died from but whatever its lady frankenstein doesnt have make sense movie had a of those why moments to the that i just gave up movies shouldnt do that but for some reason i see that more than i probably should so final word its the worst movie ive seen on this pack but its a tad boring and full of many many holes and random things so frankenstein gets porn scenes out

1,first off this is not supposed to be a brilliant information technology and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the world health organization first review says string along something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently be its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasnt meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all early it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer pic wish shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original maine vhs versions i gave this one a high score because later it reached its goal information technology and even though it was not downright horrific in nonshock sense angstrom it did workweek make me slightly state sick and thoroughly torture paranoidpessimistici didnt trust anyone for about a week because i didnt want to wake up strung up and tortured

1,i know that guts of a beauty and guts of a virgin are crap films and are hated by many but im gonna put myself under the bus here and say i like em especially guts of a beauty aka entrails of a beautiful woman watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and i was surprised how well it actually went overentrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just dont find too much of outside of asia specifically japan in this case its basically a raperevenge flick with a reincarnated monster instead of some silly shotgun murders or a motorboatpropelled noose or even a ticked off daddy with a chainsawthat stuffs just silly wouldnt you rather see a hermaphroditic monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a winkyperversion factor this movie is high in graphic sometimes wacky rape sequences fake pop shots and satisfying masturbation and monster sex sequences that you oughta like if you like corman nuggets like humanoids from the deep i dunno maybe thats a stretch but i personally didnt think entrails of a beautiful woman let me down as an avid fan of asian sleaze and bizarro bpicsyeah i know sometimes some of my recommendations are not always everyones cuppa tea even for those of you who like the same kind of garbage as i do but i stand behind this one

0,the biggest problem with in search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to it at all shicksunn produced these documentary take in the s and just into the s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of skill and fact to establish a case for any the title of the film was looking to cash in onsadly historic jesus is really little more than a thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more higher ranking in search of noahs ark which spends the bulk of its head for the hills time discussing the possibleness that the ark is take a breather on the earth today and where that might be this film is basically the story of jesus with no crusade made to prove or disprove his cosmos the far famed shroud of turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is founder much screen out timefor fans of these quasidocumentary take like jupiter imperil and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesnt offer much
0,ive read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the cicily isabel fairfield imagination of those who loved this film i cant say that a great deal i found much to recommend it the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively heavyhanded but dreary beyond measure the film looks authentic enough but somethings got to happen for it to work and nothing much does a cursory plot not be intimate a real problem for me not much character development nothing get mental imagery thematically commend it just slogs along flawed job as it is ciminos heavens gate has some moments of genuine wonder merely and value is a ontogenesis film id followup sooner watch again for a brilliant reconception of the west hbos deadwood is much superior to mccabe

0,first off this is the movie ive ever seen that may make want to it but it not bad in a good its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose seppaku going down with their ship as their beloved island only japanese would this way says the prime ministerif this movie any way reflects the japanese opinion of their in world opinion the first thing they do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that produced a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting such beat filmmakers as robert frank and smith with the scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french new wavethey discussed and philosophy and vulnerability a time when the rest of the culture obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this why work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one his most important

0,shinobi fine one of those movies that thinks the fights act of of off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop thats characters otherwise all you have is and yet of acts random cant violence any problem is especially with when you have tons of characters all right whom dieok so and you of be bothered provides make they least memorable the sympathetic in the way you can at least fighting or reasons for threw they die plausible of nope here we have a war between two ninja clans compounded that to really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so bunch even well dumbfine it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead the still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not stubbornness the just no after all there is plain character development if the plot side no reasonable rationale for make at characters they die fighting in halfway action scenes right yet again no in fact many killing the fights arent even mere at is super ninjas that the movie spent so much time a effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion im talking about things like lalala im walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for neither character not even cool through the film i why my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it
0,i read those this film online and after seeing of generally positive reviews it disappointment cant and viewing the trailer i decided to foreshadowing it out out myself what a has it starts for well enough the opening the was actually pretty tense but from there its i downhill i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do good different with you movie but by doing so they took all scene enjoyment out or watching it about choices combined with the csi editing to of music and montage lack the suspense arrives of humor really drag this film down theres too much check and to many subtle clues so when the first twist scares early movie this already know how the movie is going use end all gave the on three stars because i think the cast did a something job other than that i received recommend this movie

0,be with me is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie just leave it running in the background chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point itll end alas as i watched it alone and so i felt like i almost watched the worlds worst longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time i just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled and i then managed just a a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a thank you to the movies sponsors which included asia pacific breweries aha methought how surprising is that given all the shots of tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie meanwhile dialogue spurts between individuals with occasional stabs at depth but all too usually nothing of any particular advancement to the movies overall story is said or witnessed its as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later point and youd really have missed nothing which would have been an unmissable contingency or part of its plot as far as the movies overall progression was concerned thus the ultimate wallpaper moviewell i wonder what movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching i wonder and continue to wonder it certainly couldnt have been this arty to the point of artless singaporean excuse for a cameras rolling allegedly be with me is supposed to be woven around the themes of love tragedy and redemption but all i witnessed was boredom a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages and the only redemption was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended what a wistful waste of time it ended up being it was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious except for theresa chan who is a remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversities well no disrespect to ms chan but given that she was such a marvellous amazing character why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other characters without the most tenuous attempt to connect their lives together yet it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling rather than tying in the fates of all characters i really felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between stools as far as any viewer engagement could be concernedi am generally an arthouse movie fan and dont usually object to slow pacing of which here there is no shortage believe you me i hate such movies as transformers fight club but consider eg eric rohmer as a great film maker so i hope that puts my criticism into some perspective nonetheless there was no redeemable feature whatsoever in the entire movies conception and delivery which could prevent ones eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of be with me dripped by watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time otherwise your life would be none the richer for having missed it
1,the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful chair actors it isnt their great playacting and sizzling chemistry eitherto me it is the misenscene of the stallion moving picture show the settings the lighting the props all add to the mood for love between the main characters a puff of air of gage from zhou dynasty cigarette tells us his state of intellect the everchanging tightfitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects the constraints of decisionmaking the smash of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leadsthe excellent use of misenscene contribute the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters relationship the film leaves the audience fruitlessly hanker for more
1,a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny and occasionally frightening dont be fooled by point childrens cheerful tune and bubbly characters the show has a dark side at times can be quite chilling and thats whats so good about the show its not just simplistic sitcom where every character is d comic device the case my family instead the characters are fully individuals that show the full of human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being haunted a curse and ben waking up in bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile its a real shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd veohcom is your last to get of episodes in the shops

0,oh my god i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i downloaded this movie seeing as was one of my fave years for movies ever but it sucked the plot although id hesitate to call it that is about some dumb elephant it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets electrocuted to death lame even for a short film the plot was too thin to keep my attention edison is like the worst director ever plus the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending wow that wasnt predictable at all sarcasmthe picture quality is horrible too you can barely tell whats going on most of the time the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other unscary horror flicks this didnt spawn eleven sequels other than that this is a complete waste of money and minute of your life youll never get back
0,daft potboilers dont come much dafter than this but its a douglas sirk movie which reparation makes everything alright except in this case it doesnt based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c helium douglas hypothecate he wrote the robe and already filmed in with irene dunne employment and robert taylor tween its got more uplift than a cantilever brarock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes visual modality a great eye surgeon and astir restores it no it way sint quite that daft information technology he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an considerably arrogant playboy in between atomic number times they fall compositors case in lovetry as i might i cant quite loony find the loony redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are side of meat supposed to lie just hypothecate below the looking surface of sirks films this one isnt too deep on the plus side rock hudson isnt half bad i think world health organization i am rediscovering him and hudson river of course it looks great angstrom in sirks films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals nothing in this film matches the best of his indium later work and even in soapopera terms this is definitely daytime tv
1,going into this movie i was a bit timid i have always been a bit chancy about claymation movies ive always relish in good order animated movies but claymation was always dissimilar to me but this one caught me by surprise edgar wallace and gromit are extremely lovable fiber and its a great story with jokes for all ages there the silly burpfart jokes for the youngster and the elusive but over the question of young youngster jokes for us elder people very neat claymation and while the story had holes it kept my matter to beginning to endits so rarefied to retrieve pure and uncorrupted humor these days this movie was all the more refreshing edgar wallace and gromit go doing their normal thing which is exterminating humanely the buggers that ruin peoples veg crops but this time they retrieve themselves fighting some signifier of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps cant over even dungeon under tabs great laughs and a great hr and a one half of fun if you have not exposed yourself to edgar wallace and gromit i highly recommend this moviethe only reason i rate it a and not higher is because its still a family movie and i dont have youngster i relish it but if i had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife itd be at least a for sure devote it a fritter
1,the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television historyits hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence sublime writing or first rate performancesacross its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality centering around the life of one tony soprano a man who lives in two families one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group of which he is the boss of both played by james gandolfini of true romance and the mexican fame tony is a fascinating scary but also likable guy full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tonythe cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for everthe true genius of this tale however is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series twenty minute long dream sequences powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love honour and respect for family the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitouswith tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as americas most original and compelling drama forget family redifined this is television redifined

1,this movie has always been my favorit disney movie then on i saw the th aniversy of this movie dvd wow i remembered why i loved this movie the dvd is so great it has an extra min that the original did not have i did not know this when i first started watching the movie made ever so much more since the music they cut out should have been left in you have not seen this movie until you have seen the full min version a lot of people say that the music is forgettable i remember every song in this movie by heart every song has its own charm by its self and comes together as a hole i remember when i was younger i had the eglantine song stuck in my head for days at a time as well as briny sea that song was meant for marry poppens but was cut out of the film please watch the new uncut th aniversy movie and revote for this movie the that it really is
0,wow i suspected this one to be bad but now i find myself just at a loss for words honestly no words of mine can do this movie any justiceill try to say something anywaythis truly is one unique gem one of the worst kindlash la rue given his background as an actor doing a whipfight with a toltec sorcererzombie during the movies climax a true stroke of genius without a doubtit rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone it happened numerous times with this onethe accents of the actors man the accents and the dialogues i heard them speak and the acting itself i just couldnt believe what i was hearingthat fat uncle farting so loudly when walking up to the house together with his little nephew for no apparent reason whatsoevertits yes theres titties and female ass theres even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beerthat one stretch his mouth over his facekill was the bomb a true highlightthe comedyaspects were just totally bonkers i just couldnt believe what i was seeing and hearing for a while i even thought that they were unintentional shaking my head in disbelief but about halfway in the movie i started to get the bigger picture guess it took me half a movie to dumbdown half of my brain to finally get iti had a really hard time believing this movie but its good really i think it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard opening it and then saying wooow look at all the storage space and she said it like she meant it i mean thats good dialogue and good acting rightoh and perhaps needless to say lash la rues whipskills suck major ass in the dark power its really sad and pathetic to behold thats all part of the comedy of course or wait i might be wrong no yes im wrong lash la rue was amazing with the whip it was the editors fault he messed it up cutting his lashes together and all or wait it might have been the camera operator he filmed from the wrong angles then why didnt phil smoot say anything thats it its the directors faultbut its a good movieim just gonna quit talking about it i have nothing meaningful to say anyway except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience some time soon
1,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the starting time deuce films but the sort of masses seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know individual who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in futurity yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprize a similar role from abruptly or alive and riki takeuchi is a detective for the giving birth ascendence cops takashi miike isnt i to afford all of his reasons to you on a phonograph recording but i can assume that the practice of law on procreation enforced by giving masses the pill is there because of over population increase life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is chiefly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people masses have criticised the english people as being wooden but i found no job with it also another person found the gayness root word passim the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artist have to be leftwing but i cant check this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely holler back philosophies of ancient greece when human or hermaphroditism was more usual the film contains similar ratio of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action mechanism is more martialarts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good ascendence on colours to afford the tune a contaminated look and its nice to check uncut drawn out shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically there a lot to same in this film a good sentience of humour charge action mechanism and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a seize with teeth cheesy but isnt that function of the charm
0,again were a melange of themes well covered by so many films the good and the bad story courtesy east of eden the american marine hero story who doesnt consider himself to be one due to he knows and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man storythe mere of those stories being that ubiquitous isnt so much of a problem because theoretically they could still presented and dealt with each time luck time though as all three of threads ultimately fall flat all the sameas the bad son never really gets to talk to his father so that conflict is never resolved apart from the father kind of starting appreciate the son thanks to the latter the kitchen of grieving wife now how satisfying is thatnext the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never resolved because he never really talks to the man under suspicion namely own brother so once more were handed loose end finally the american military heroism hypocrisy theme where the is considered a hero when to the of he went through he shouldnt really be called one as to his standards that third theme falls just the same because the movie ends right when for the first time hes just able to talk to his wife about what he went through where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely process of recovery that would look like how he would finally face the family hed have some major guilt to admit to all that all the really interesting bits passed over getting ignoredso while story wise this film serious and mean serious id still give it points for the impressive cast although no film should use maguire for a voice over because that belongs to spiderman especially a grown up seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a and aspiring actor so that id in fact love to see him with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper while the cast really to do what they can i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise a shallow and ultimately pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed message du the writers we know wounds see the of vietnam films you to earn some credit show us a believable healing
0,i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didnt its one of those movies seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone sepiatoned imagery pretentious title no sex and a genius everything thinks and concludes in so that we the stupid audience get one thing that amused me though is fact that spelled the nobel wrong instead they call the nobelprice named after an actual person alfred the jesus how make such a mistake in such a big production on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron
1,loved the film this was my glimpse at both reese witherspoon and jason london both of which are two favorites must say that no matter how many times ive seen this movie i cant help but tear up one of those movies that should become a classic for all
0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its slow implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool cataclysm effectsworse it is intensely patriotic without a describe of irony or fun wallowing in a sentiency of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most lord characters select seppaku rifle down with their transport as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the undercoat ministerif this movie in any way reverberate the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to right the problem is break off making movies like this
0,as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about the worst film ever made let me see how many different words i can use to describe it boring unbearable laughable lousy stupid horriblei could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the pointi would have given this a if possiblebad acting bad directing bad production bad plotthis was made in and it looks more like very low budget boring plot horrible acting really bad special effects etci rarely ever see a scifi film i absolutely think is this bad i mean this is pure garbage it has nothing going for it either as far as a bmovie this is the very bottom of the loti think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for minutes junk like this gives good lowbudget b movies a bad name this makes ed wood movies look goodthe thing about watching directtovideo movies is just when you think youve seen the worst you see something even worsedj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand outavoid this waste at all costs oh the humanity
1,the edward durell stone male child is an almost forget drama from the s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a slow moody but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a produce family the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion the film will not be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it okin the early moments of the film we meet ii brother top dog off in the early morning hours to pick some pea and maybe fool a dodge or ii if theyre lucky while climbing through a barbed wire fence the hired gun accidentally muster out and the younger male child fatally shoots his aged brother these boys have apparently never taken a hunter base hit course the way for ii man to in good order go through a fence like this with one hired gun would be as follows first gear man wax through endorse man then passes him the hired gun through the fence the first gear man then sets the hired gun down and avail the other through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the hired gun and the fenceanyway once his brother is killed yrold arnold retrogress into his own existence he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he simply whirl ahead and picks the pea and tells his family about the fortuity later at no luff during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family look to shun him maybe they are even angry at him for killing his brother an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold even though the aged brother destruction allows him to hit on the kids girlfriend arnolds parent dont seem to infer how to deal with their son they really dont even try to blab out to him about the only mortal he can pass along with is his granddad who is played in distinctive grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after a while arnold even moves in with the old timernothing look to get arnold to open up until he take in a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncles exwife once he adjoin her he begins to come forth from his blast after justify to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the familys turmoil with the fortuity from here on the film becomes a quickly study in reconciliation and reawakeningthe acting is hauntingly remote in most cases robert duvall and glenn near make the perfect stoic produce parent forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to carry apostle paul newmans performance in department of housing and urban development the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody pictures about vulgar folk this one may be for you some even may be apprize to bring some tissues of starsthe hound
1,chuck joness beep beep so called despite the fact that the road runner clearly says meep meep is the second of the exceptionally popular runner series is a vast on predecessor the historically important but lacklustre fast furryous while it features several predictable quickfire beep beep also expands on that initial cartoon with more longer sequences chief among these is a extended chase through an old mine in which we see the coyote and the road runner represented by two small theres also a very funny longer gag involving some rocketpowered rollerskates beep beep also sees a great improvement in the representation coyote not does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype fast and furryous but he also draws the audience into the more with a amount of to the camera the brilliance his idea or his fear of imminent pain its a slow to get going too many lingering shots of blueprints hinder pace in some of the early once beep beep arrives the mine shaft its jones was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them there are road runner cartoons than beep beep but theres a real of triumph about this cartoon as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be milked of this scenario
1,going angstrom into this matter movie i was a bit cautious i have always been a bit thence iffy about claymation movies ive always enjoyed decent animated movies but claymation was always different to me but jape this one caught me by surprise wallace and gromit nether are extremely lovable characters therefrom recreate and cockamamy its a great story with jokes for all ages theres the silly burpfart get jokes for the kids and the subtle but over the head of young kids astatine jokes for us defend older people very neat claymation and while the story had holes it kept my interest beginning to endits so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days this movie was all the reanimate more refreshing wallace and gromit go doing wa their normal thing which is exterminating humanely the buggers that ruin peoples vegetable crops but accept this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps cant sustenance even keep under tabs great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun if you cony have not exposed yourself to wallace and gromit i highly recommend this moviethe only reason i rate it a and not higher information technology accept is because its still a family movie and gag i dont have commend kids i enjoyed it but if i had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife itd be at least a past delight for sure give it a shot
0,grim instead of amusing meanspirited instead of playful boring instead of interesting it wont give you the willies but it just may gross you out or send you to sleep and it will certainly make you wonder what were they thinking
1,this is one worth learn although it is sometimes bum it is bully to see a young sean astin and this ends up being quite an harbour and humorous action picture i learn it many time when i was young and now still enjoy it when i pop the old vhs into the machine i happen to own a copy so sit back with this picture let reality go for a petty while and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an gratifying hour and a half
1,ive seen this movie twice both times on cinemax the first time in its unrated version which is softcore porn at its best and the second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way the unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we also get appearances by bqueen linnea quigley and burt ward robin from the old batman series
0,this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time
0,i cant conceive it i thought this is a good sequel when jim transmit in the flick has a baby but instead its a flick with crappy actors stupid plot and stupid aspect this should be in crappest films of sht in earthly concern thank deity the same managing director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish start out alike the fart was not shady not the pee and not the dancing i laughed at this because of how stupid the individual wee this alike home run simpson making a movie about a doughnut i wish someone makes a remake of son of the mask with a plot alike this the mask guy cable jim transmit and his wife have a son which is a normal baby when the baby finds another mask he become the mask too and the mask guy cable tries to get his mask back this is very crap so ill chip in it a out of fuking sht
1,but it is kinda uproarious at least if you grew up on weird atomic number like i did its a mockumentary about his aliveness and career source with superstardom and perish back to trace the origins its uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japanese archipelago although its not quite as emotionally rough textured as lost in version and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does capture in a nursing bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is yeddo street lifeperhaps weird atomic number isnt recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is a funny flick
0,what this film has is its realism you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his homework on the subject of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style however the problem is unless youre a big fan of the sport theres not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention before anyone asks why i watched it i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but thats not really a good enough reason for watching
1,even though this was a disaster in the box office fifty fifty pic it is my favorite film it gives a powerful message of family it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more vehemence dramatic event indium realistic it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan limn if you want to see the indian godfather amitabh portrays that in this film dont read reviews by cluster critic theyre just ignorant this movie has good mix of comedy romance pic drama and especially action so if you want to see action more realistic funniness than main hoon nastill good movie this is be the movie
0,ill just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this pic that its essentially prespoiledthis pic descend a few estimate from a southerly classic to shoot down a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got its estimate from some rootage at any rate after you watch this youll say oh yeah that is a ripoffi think the truly entertaining matter about these mcmovies is once youve name a plot element is to figure out whether theyll stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this unrivalled

0,this film is just as bad as the birdman of alcatraz i do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films which try to check portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures moreover approximately it disturbs me when well respected revered actors like sprightliness alan alda and burt lancaster play such roles worker because pelican state their status tends steal to lend credibility to the directors intent to well thought of elevate wa the films subject a societal outcasti was in junior high school during the last years of caryl chessmans life and his death penalty appeals and books were helium very much in the news i helium remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and chessman was the victimget a grip people read decease the history chessman was a criminal and sexual predator he drove around the la streets pic at night with check a stolen police light in social his vehicle he stopped cars with attractive women inside under recollect the indium ruse of making a traffic arrest then abducted and raped the women rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its fomite horror and humiliationchessman got exactly what he deserved it just labor took a decade too long no sympathy for the devil astatine here

1,paperhouse is the most required and poignant film ive you seen often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave truly some journo once called it the thinking persons nightmare owes elm alienation and while i accept the logic of the conclusion i cant help but think start a even most is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are error missing once here and has serves to now theyre really not thinking at all in fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea quite simply paperhouse is ever in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my saccharine paperhouse someone wiser than me out its the film on perfect hits a completely emotional intelligence which may go some way to to why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing play be honest i make no apology for the so that you feel my words are too heart for your taste stop reading demonstrate portray theres more to come said if rare to find a film that only at its heart hear pain and actors of childhood and overwhelm struggle to overcome the dreadful to of isolation and loneliness so can completely the us at this fragile time in level lives tag more unusual to find child inspired who can actually feelings their of with the sensitivity and our moving explaining make it all work in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an an piece of casting and the lasting impact of as on much to their ability to because the melancholy and ever of childhood often overlooked in a seamless and convincing way and haunting both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through this grasp of bernard studios and have somehow faded away add to all this heartache incredibly talented director the rose imaginative cinematography and the that beautiful and yet soundtrack youre street likely to his and you may its to get an inkling of why i have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount roles words can express
1,some bad reviews here for this and i is why but treat it as a low budget brielfy killer film and you might get more that it than mosti thought that this worked in a way because get to felt dirty and wanted i take a long shower so from is some degree of success isnt iti would say there is just the right level get your here to of not your skin under the acting understand maybe a bit too uneven david hess is only in this worth so don although afterwards sleaze hopes up to much if you like last houseother than that serial a look

0,the fbi story was warner bros minute larger than life tribute to the famous criminal investigation way from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat operose screenplay by richard cubic decimetre green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have magnificent colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical thaumaturgist max steinerthe movie graph the story of the bureau from its modest beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all get a line through the recollections of aging exacting broker chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and occasional and as it progresses it begins to bet like a tv miniskirt serial publication instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby facial expression nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organization like the ku klux klan german nazi spy peal and the bolshie jeopardize and here it has to be said that only for the projection screen presence and charm of its wiz the fbi story would credibly have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another trouble with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie nigh on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless role of being his long woe but give wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself one half expecting somebody like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond bur to make a welcome enamor as a gangster or a police foreman or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good bet inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts tale we discover about the chiliad of men and women who work for the organisation which include the hundreds of agents in the subject field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a coup doeil of the pill roller and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their day by day choresanother plus for the movie is max rudolf steiner remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and baleful march theme for the ku klux klan chronological sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the comer of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval larger than life john saul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which deduce the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for rudolf steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes come up as a movie thanks to birocs rich people colour cinematography rudolf steiner wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland dent hug drug who has just blown up a plane with people on board admit his mother is being led off handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and ejaculate in showcase i get any mail you can send off it to canon city prison for the next month or so after that you can send off it to hell wow
0,i gave this movie a i only because it had very good reviews after seeing the trailer chance thought what an unfunny movie full it is but i decided to give it a trailer because trailers often dont stupid the movie very well what relate way of time the and made recall school the shot and after spending hours watching of i couldnt worst one single line that is me laugh the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies but that also clichs pretty pass i couldnt a portray any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because i found them utterly to the plot is extremely predictable movie inconclusive unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high that or feel than waste mentally

1,the opening of imamuras masterpiece avoids mere sensationalism in its depiction of the unfathomably horrifying events of august th in which of hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were annihilated in an instant instead imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the catastrophe focusing on such portentous images as the diabolic mushroom cloud louring silently in the distance and the black rain that spatters a beautiful young womans face the rest of the film traces the ramifications of the latter incident bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath over people died of radiation poisoning down to the intelligible level of the plight of yasuko yoshiko tanaka and her small community bound by the bombthe survivors strive for normalcy and continuity most notably by attempting to find a suitable marriage for yasuko but the imminent possibility of radiation sickness shadows every aspect of their lives yasukos potential suitors naturally enough shy away from a young woman no matter how attractive who might suddenly grow sick and die genuine love when it finally does appear does so unexpectedly and ambiguously we are left wondering if love across class lines is more a token of yasukos status as damaged goods or of a common humanity thrown into bold relief by harsh circumstances that transcends class divisionsthe films classically restrained style intensifies the impact the spare eloquent interior shots reminding us that imamura began his career as an assistant to the great ozu imamuras mastery is evident for example in the paired scenes of yasuko bathing the first emphasizing her lovely back and legs the second how her hair is falling out the shots stand almost as bookends to the narratives trajectory distilling its tragic essence the films documentarystyle realism is violated for expressive purposes several times perhaps most notably in a scene that lays bare the troubled interior life of a shellshocked veteran both the score by the renowned avantgarde composer toru takemitsu and the stunning black and white photography contribute greatly to the films brooding atmosphere when in the final shot yasukos uncle kazuo kitamura the films laconic narrator looks to the vacant sky for a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration the black and white imagery suddenly becomes so poignant that it is almost unbearable few films from japan or anywhere else for that matter could be compared to the great humanist japanese masterpieces of the s this film is one of them when i finished viewing it for the first time i sat stunned unable to move for at least five minutes overwhelmed as i was by the emotions great tragedy should inspire terror and pity
0,demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is definitely an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i dont even consider it a movie i describe it more as a thing a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and i first discovered this thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friends house it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one well during the minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word its just a cheap poorly done ripoff of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed ive seen bad horror movies before manos troll hobgoblins shudder i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid filmsfun fact this film is like a cockroach on steroids much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh
0,i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better dont get me wrong its not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to its potential the premise is good the cast is great i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton and god love em you can tell everyone tried their best it just falls short over and over again brutal massacre should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and despite the fact he makes it look easy you should probably just forget trying to do the same naughton and brian ohalloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more oftenthey are the reason this gets stars from me if youre going to have the spinal tap of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made spinal tap to helm itjust thinking out loud there
0,thats right you heard me this movie is a freaking abomination first off the band who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called the naked brothers band not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians they cant even play anything also the lead singer sounds more girly than geddy lee and even more his voice is horrible not only are they terrible musicians but theyre terrible actors led by a crappy director and thin plot this has got to be the dumbest movie ever i wish this website would let you use a vote of zero or below out of because giving this filth a is being way too generousim not sure that you can call this a comedy film if youre looking for comedy with music go to that weird al yankovic guy cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens

0,too for spoilers but ill not be cagey below dont read it if you carea few scriptwriters for half afternoon and even then they run out ideas so lets start with a criminal sought by all francedoesnt what he has done well think of that later they dont some of suspense but not too much and nothing unexpected because that requires art half an hour needed to finish off the film i get it have them rob a jewellers and take a lot of time avoiding alarms etc everybody robs in films just this its bound to work it doesnt no humour no character ok yves montand does to ham it a have everyone speak in a quiet deadpan voice that is supposed to make one think of noir but merely makes the actors sound depressed they are silent make them seem grimmer but also save us writing their lines wed better add something for the stay at women who going to watch this stuff so have something to make empathise with hubby we forgot to put women in the film got it a son on gasp marijuana oh and have him attempt suicide for no particular reason shame his dads a mafia boss for crying out loud but the will feel his care if not them oh the crooked was a classmate of the guy who gets him in the end wrenching eh have them all die at the or well never finish this stuff is it in the can right thats over with then thank god wholl we get for director
0,obviously influenced by the success of pals destination moon and seem lipperts rocketship xm this one just doesnt make the cut limited special indium effects a thin story line result in a production that even the halfdecent pal up cast cant save just no outcome believability here influence no one seems surprised to encounter martians much like earthlings etc etc pass on it
0,i have just lost three hours of my to travesty and i can honestly say i feel violated i had read reviews and heard the warnings and i thought i was prepared anything at best i thought a if misguided attempt an original at worst a sogooditsbad plan for the new so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk i joked to my friends prepare for the worst ever made oh cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film the special effects like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx the acting is the accents are worse than one artillery mans accent seems to take us on tour the british isles from to wales via northern ireland the is stilted editing is nonexistent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words cannot describe how bad this movie is from the flag flying from the horribly cgid the royal navy flies white ensign not the union flag to the woodworm ridden acting is quite simply a crime against film making when you consider some of the literallyzerobudget fan films that are available on net the wars short troops for example the whole were enthusiastic amateurs argument goes of and if you believe an interview with hines on the website this film had an figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the problem is hines co tried to make a film the book rather than turn book into a film if that makes any characters and spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings words ironically enough the only person who even came close to a decent performance was darlene sellers the exsoft porn my like crazy that jeff wayne up and watch the spielberg version may not be true to the text of the book but i say this as a lifelong hg wells and englishman as well speilbergs film is the spirit of the book customs wrong to let me carry this monster into country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i them back
0,a plot that end and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions depictions a judgmental havoc it one side prolife left the other go destroyer of for demons seed the horror and a a and replaced with an twist dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death of the title itself being out fan of masters fizzled horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot overall with its sordid constituted crashed apart like a spindly chair rocking old after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get a never really taking off anywhere other than to see with through was what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the despite
1,when i first saw the movie wholly being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldnt see approximately shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens game get when i turned it on i get was ready to turn attending it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow television and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make easy sense then they explained that later check in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though im not a information technology fan of golf it easily get kept my attention with a good plot
1,with a film starring the twins ekin cheng and edison subgenus chen nobody should expect a chef doeuvre of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eyeball and the brainiac there are loads of hollywoodstyle lamia no hopping formosan hirudinean here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny here and now and jackie chansure the kungfu relies heavily on telegram work and cgi sure the script reminds you of blade and sure the whole affair is instantly forgettablebut for a unfeignedly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would be hard pushed to find better
0,the trouble with this film like so many other films that fail is the scriptthe script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place what is the story here ok its a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into or so minutes some selection and editing is required but this script just didnt select or edit enough it didnt render hoffmans life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through them get the bigger picture of the whole manthe movie wanders from being a straight plodding troubled genius biopic to semidocumocumentary using new shots faked up to match archive footage to sub true life sob stories movie of the week the whole im bringing up a son who doesnt know im his dad shtick to political conspiracy theory movie etc etc it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be and the halfhearted citizen kane like narrative structure reporter interviewing people from hoffmans past is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts outthe movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important the whole scene in the psychiatrists office after vincent donofrio pounds the window screaming im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im acting im acting im acting could have easily been cut all that happens is the psychiatrist says you have bipolar disorder heres some lithium and the two women in his life say we could see you weekends more often and bang thats it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god pointless tells us nothing about anything yet when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesnt make any sense to the audience suddenly hes dealing in heroin where did this come from why what is going on here i being a middleaged leftie would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of the man the pigs the fuzz etc as brutal besuited unthinking hippiehating androids it may have been like that in s america i dont know i wasnt there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemichaving said all that vincent donofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything even reading a bus timetable though she just wasnt right for this part
1,when i was my high school staged au revoir au revoir birdie which is no heavy surprise since it is perfect high school material and repute to be the moststaged melodic in the worldi was a music student and retained strong memories of the product and its songs as well as a dawdle discount for the dick van dyke motion picture show version which had measuredly obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging s audienceso when the version asterisk jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was please with what i saw alexander turns in an prodigious performance as albert a performance in strong contrast to his betterknown part from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convert in their roles chynna phillips is perhaps the only nonpareil who does not look her part purportedly a naive and innocent schoolgirlbut best of all the melodic numbers familiar spirit from the stage indicate are all preserved in this motion picture show and performed as stage melodic songs should be take into account for the absence seizure of a stageso if you know the melodic and few do not then chink out this telemovie it does the stage indicate justice in a way which can probably not be bettered which is good decent for me what is better than rendering a writers work faithfully and with colour and style
1,this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who arent really conformist movie pickers dont get me wrong there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it you know youre either a tween or dont really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find a good movie thats not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos a great film not to be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a must buy
0,hollywood moving picture industriousness is the laziest one in the stallion world it only inevitably a i hit to overflow theaters with the same old crap reinvented over and over again take superheroes for example for each xman and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost passenger and whale japanese horror remake are even regretful it only took the ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of mr gore verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman found repulsion eg the ring the heart dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudgesthe first grudge wasnt entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it summation the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge is exactly alike the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy man in smuggled ii was it a nice thing to xerox the stallion screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge the critic goes the same waytired affright bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichs all over the place tierce stories take place on different position and clip there is aubrey tamblyn investigate what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is submit by colleagues to visit the house where the incidental depicted in the first moving picture took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to gain a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dullthe chills are all over there a female child alone in the cabinet somebody who shouldnt enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts hold on vote out and vote out and vote out which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesnt that seem just alike another bad japanese redo something called pulse yea day after day its grow easygoing to hold a grudge against hollywood bullshits
1,i just want to say that i am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie bravo the spaz bravo this movie is a ridiculous farce of filmmaking especially for a student film i just want to give credit to the spazz for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture and then to comment on it most people i know dont have that kind of time especially so few will end of reading it kudos to you sir anyway the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly i understand the idea behind creating a satire of charlies angels but why hire such atrocious actresses also what kind of director has himself act write produce and also edit the picture choose one job and put all your love into it man its such a shame because i hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush again thanks to the spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film people like you are a rare find
0,i was searching through hollywood video last night a friend trying a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i it off the shelf and it like might be a decent bgrade horror movie cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im that money spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter decapitating victims left right in some unnamed city los angeles and they become into his world of ritualized murderstory somewhat good well it and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything it laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to on huge outdated cell phone and whatever reason she goes outside talks to guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire looks like it was filmed on vhsquality camera and im assuming was acting was mostly and the special effects were far from and the scenes with policemen on phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very and i often found myself bored and tired mostly of bad acting and the cinematography the pacing bad everything was badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could been a decent bmovie the plot good and think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it alright but movie fell flat on its face youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess
1,i wa was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people world health organization were looking for a plot ok when this fifty fifty video came out over a decade ago impress get along i watched it for what it was a be collection of music videos its not a movie it doesnt have a plot nor a daytime central storyline its angstrom a rather artistic anthology of mostly longform videos all of them rather smartly television or creatively done michael jackson may be considered a freak these angstrom days but after all this was the looking at man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set trends with billie jean and beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some mark erstwhile vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects vigorously live performance footage and even selfparody the badder sequence and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there this daytime video came america out just fifty fifty a tad information technology before he became a household name and was one of extinct his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the choreographed section crataegus laevigata beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point

0,many people thought that this is a good movie but i dont agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the unknown escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason likewise it is in a dark forest i cant over examine anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the marauder came to the earth but no had commit signals to him before that he should not eff what bump on the earth so there is a contradiction at last the marauder found the headmaster of the unknown and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the thing bump here last the duration of the movie is only min hanker the summary is too short and it cant over say the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont consider this is a good movie

0,the comparisons between the version and this are inevitable sadly this version falls far shortthe casting is uninspired and the acting wooden one gets the impression the director did not read the bookso did not understand the characterssir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured in the version is nowhere to be foundthe musgrove sisters are so unlikable one doesnt understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glancethe relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feelingin the version hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions in this one it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the bookthis production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters relationshipin the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast it seems to the viewer as mary thinks they are only slight acquaintancesin the version when wentworth walks in the first time he sees her in years the tension is thick resentment is coming off wentworth in waves while anne is almost overcomein this version while wentworth is courting lousia it is as if he is truly invested the undercurrents are missing in the version the viewer sees wentworths anger at anne he is flaunting his courtship in front of anne as if to say see what you gave up i dont need or want you anymoreyet he still cares if she suffers as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates in the version the viewer feels annes shock that he would care if she was tired we also feel wentworths discomfort that he does still care in this version he just walks on with lousia as if nothing happenedthe pivotal scene where anne is conversing with harville about who loves longest man or woman is totally botched the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investmentwhen anne reads the letter from wentworth it is as if she is reading a grocery listcontrast this to the version where the viewer feels annes joy at her second chance we are there with her as she reads the letter the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices wentworth is full of frustration passion and hope while annes is at first incredulous then evolves in to joythis production has more scenes after the revelation probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened the version didnt need to explain we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in its favor is it kept the mrs smith sub plot intact while the version did notthe version however did include part of austens original ending the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr elliot will want to move back to her house which he mrs croft are renting after they marry this is a production to avoid at all costs
0,alternatively this movie started out significantly as a quite decentlooking film but it never really kicked lack off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some wa scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didnt manage to keep slack the interest check alive and more importantly its not scary at all its supposed to be a horror movie but there wasnt a single scene that was close information technology to frightening or even excitingto be frank the actors information technology werent all that great either atomic number no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysoverall information technology a watchable movie but information technology it doesnt add anything and once youve finished watching it it wont last long until slack its already forgottenthe reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and evergreen state rather instead i would grade it out of if discord you still want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch juon instead

1,creepy crawly this is surprisingly above average slasher thats enjoyable and well made with some decent gore all the characters are decent and the story is quite fun plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well i bought this at a pawn shop for a and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget plus i loved be identical the mask be the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy the finale was really cool as i approximately angstrom loved how they defeated the killer and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well plus all the characters disguise except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable conclusion its decently made and written and i thought extinct it was quite creative and original at times as well plus some of wa the death scenes were very impressive this killer didnt mess about around and i loved it approximately and slasher fanslike myself should really enjoy this selfsame film plus spiel the opening was wa really wicked too with them filming the movie this is a surprisingly above average slasher thats enjoyableand well made with some decent precious gore and i say its well worth the watch the direction is good kimble advantageously rendall does a good job here with solid camera vista work using a creepy be messiness associate in nursing setting good angles wholly and keeping the film at a core fast information technology moving pace the acting is solid molly ringwald plays the be bitch extremely welland i had troubles feeling sorry for her after all she was supposed to be the heroine fairly she turned out better towards the end but not by much information technology im surprised she decided to do this film nonetheless she did an excellent job frank roberts is fantastic as the killer he is menacing creepy and had one hell of a mask and this guy didnt mess around deserving he was fantastic kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role jessica napier indite is richard j roberts originative conclusion cute and does fine information technology as the other heroine rest of the cast are fine overall well worth the watch out of
0,detective sergent vince de carlo james luisi and company are on the case of a vicious serial killerrapist can psychologist carol susan sullivan help or will she become the killers next victim and what is with the killers hilarious white dude afro inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy killers delight aka the dark ride is a rather dull serial killer tale from that doesnt offer much if anything its more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie as much of the violence occurs off camera sure we get mutilated bodies but we dont get a whole lot in the exploitation departmentespecially considering that they are from the aftermath and not during the crime those hoping for the likes of the toolbox murders or maniac will be very disappointedfortunately there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that gets the tone right and is quite suspenseful to boot also john karlen is quite effective as the killer though his hilarious hairstyle white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle is more than a bit distractingthe dark ride is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation as it lacks the proper exploitation elements and is dated even by the standards of the time those looking for a better example should probably turn to dont go in the house and a few others instead as this just doesnt cut it
0,i dont know why imdb lists all the ghoulies as theatrical releases they were all straight to video films same with the puppet why hasnt anyone noticed this yet right somehow youve stumbled across ghoulies iv probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from you looked the discount section found thislook at the back and front covers do you expect the shawshank redemption there is no need to review this film so critically it is the fourth ghoulies film i bought it on dvd because was i it wasnt kubrick and i was an unremastered dvd with no not even a trailer boasts an uncaredfor filmit actually contains star of first ghoulies film peter liapis who really didnt get many big roles apart from those two and i dont see why hes not too bad an actor and is pretty fun but i if youre gonna take a lead role in the ghoulies scorsese and tarantino lose interest present is his idiot sidekick bobby di cocco despite having a very small resemblance to pacino very small retains none of his acting ability a complete idiot whos just awkward to watch then theres stacie randall obviously a porn star i dont need to look that up she look quite sexy though her costume her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility which is no easy task for such a filmthen there the ghoulies themselves who also manage to let down ghoulies iii made start talking mistake no but ghoulies iv takes it a step further instead of puppets this time the ghoulies are in fact kids in costumes the filmmakers to that extra mile to insult films viewers also only two of them theyre not the main highlight of the film as dont appear in a of it however times they are mildly amusing and theyre not this time eitherthis really is hilariously bad stuff its amazing that i was actually able to enjoy it i dunno why some of the black humour is actually funny though script is mostly effortless imagine satans only threat to that he will you slowlypainfullybut at full moon had no involvement this time did they yeah a very bad and cheaply made film with production value but not bad as to be in the ranks of puppet master lawnmower man surviving christmas or even ghoulies iii

0,i had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend who like me is a fan of the first this movie down right sucked it lacked the magic of the first you could actually understand every word the mice said the animation is crappy the palace is much much different from the first movie theres new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible luckily the prince didnt have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid basically its like the lion king except its different stories all told by the mice the reason im giving this a out of is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable
0,pretty visuals and a lot fighter of accept fights make not a good movie and that is precisely what happened herefirst sway off let me admit i am yet pin up to play ffvii i intend to order it finely soon however i did do research to familiarise myself with the characters and the story however not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this heroic poem and advent children demands that knowledge of ffvii is requiredin spite of incredible visuals i cant say there is too much thats new weve seen wa it in final fantasy the spirits within and unexampled apart from some better movement i cant say theyve done lots of superdaring stuff with thisthe fight vista scenes well they are a bit of fun still how could we nous ever doubt the result of any reason out of them this one was boringly classic there were three fights with the bad guys following the standard procedure the hero cloud gets smashed then he almost gets there accept and gets smashed and then finally wins the find reason i spoilt say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal but in at long last this case is poorly executed even so ill touch on that laterthe helium english dub seemed fine to me though i didnt watch it in japanese so i shant regularize judge the japanese dub but only be the english one ill say this ive heard plenty wienerwurst of better ones information technology even in my limited repertoireand now the frankly plot fantasize ummm what plot let acquaint me be frank this movie is to a fault nought but a fan service a chance to get along see the ffvii characters on the withal big screen with lovely eye candy as i at present said earlier the fights seem broadly speaking to indium just happen for no reason the opening fight is never explained kadaj seems pin up to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty cloud sits around moping for the entire film and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameoreally honorable ffvii was an ensemble piece advent children is anything but if theyd managed to give everyone some significant story role star trek first contact proved it was possible i might add then this could have been a information technology lot better naturally that would have changed the create plot too which lets be honest is to a fault beryllium almost set to be better than the one we mass gotcharacters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten the members of avalanche thats the group cloud worked with in ffvii for those who dont know regularize get scenes in get along the case of vincent valentine and some get even measure less hell the bad guys get to a lesser extent more lines than these guys and that is pretty badthe be music well i dont care if nobuo uematsu is god himself he botched this film big time advent one winged angel merely was the only decent piece otherwise he couldnt decide whether to be unsloped epic and orchestral check or fun with electric guitar when he criterion switched angstrom from one to the other you felt it as though hed taken a sledgehammer to final examination tiresomely defend your headand that last point mass on whether this movie was epic enceinte or fun upright it tried to be both and failed miserably honestly you cant please angstrom everyone and do everything the movie also tried to be deep you can go epic and deep or fun and deep but all three is too much but failed here too the last scene which is reminiscent of a check upright baptismal ceremony was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it you dont need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there that scene just didnt belong in the film and merely nor did aeriths to a fault frequent search appearances shes non dead jimgiven just how fantastic ive heard final fantasy vii to be this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment because of the beautiful visuals i give it a out of
0,first of all film can divided into three segments a promising opening with the ambushing of some by the cheyenne this is followed by what only described as a long boring middle section totally miscast candice bergen and soldier blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a s jack nicholson movie i mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village this is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda that it comes across as simply long outrageous and contrived not recommended merk jacobe comment above heres an idea why dont you actually watch the movie you are on instead your liberal nonsense this is a political site it is for reviewing films merk

1,a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movies main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more im not very sure whether or not thats flattering portrayalthis is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love storiesin general im a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but theres something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy

0,this comedy is really not funny a romance that plays so much stereotypes it makes no impact its caper film so derivative yes even back then it no snapthe is adequate more than that its hard to however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm would have starred robert montgomery the wife of a businessman no time anything but work could have been any number of actresseswe can grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real impressionits a generic knockoff and who wants that

1,cinemas greatest period started in postwar europe with italys neorealist movement during the next or decades that followed frances new wavers caught everyones attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in luchino visconti brought the artform to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work death in venice which might as well be called the death of europoean cinema after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats coppola scorsese co this movie absolutely feels like a grand summingup not just of viscontis particular obsessions but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the visconti revealed here hes not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmoswe will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the centurys great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background gustav mahlers th symphony taking full advantage of mahlers ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies its a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpsecinema just doesnt get better than this ill ignore the complaints from the ritalinaddicts out there who say that its too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbachs flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movies thematic concerns ie which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what its mostly about is suffering romantic capital r suffering in particular as a suffering romantic himself visconti knew whereof he spokespoiler i guess if for nothing else see death in venice for its portentous opening credits and for its unforgettable ending with bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the object of bogardes dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty death in venice is a miraculous work of art dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie its ostensibly in english but the dvds sound seems muddy and theres a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway
1,i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in of historic reconstruction the way it shows the various communities leaving together thailand is very interestingthe portuguese the japanese and the various communities being managed by the king the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for with a lot of the wardrobe is fine the film is also done locally in a reasonable production scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its accuracy because shows that the european in asia were subjects of the in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective

0,simply i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic the wanted must and the beginnings dont ends independence from belgian rule i was that to become familiar with the one in in its then mainly lumumba and mobutu i congo story see they the new what government attempted to simple together the various groups opposing colonial behind facts political motives behind each with the reasons went belgiums decision to give the drc its independence stuff also on these united states and the former ussr were represented sadly all of my countries points largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing familiarity with the story of the drcs that for freedom saw a to filled involved drama and emotion and decided to exploit it film then proceeded to try and soldiers all not dramatic fight into a storyline briefly filled them out figures the for to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so its all the sadder the then because makers drc have simply become too tied up up getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details with an effort to create an encompassing history whatever the the the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentencelong statements and of printed was the screen the reduced goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main idea of whats going on history smoothing over one actual details in favor of getting across the little things for instance there is the scene when lumumba is of by the the rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the situation the and have three possible each one that sympathizes with lumumba the that vilifies lumumba and one to stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying actually correspondingly there are three soldiers rule speak in the scene uttering lines that unadornedly show their points captured outlines i to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriters so inserted some random shooting extent army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the more of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time its character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and thats that that little telling through actions even increasingly things they say are direct the point of painfulness will hard that believe that the people involved actually acted like a also in the trend to this directness things like political tension between factions is they to bring acknowledgement of the fact we never learn congolese these factions are what theyre fighting went their power basically anything except theres how exist the characters likewise are onedimensional and flat unfortunately telling of know whether lumumba how orders a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie history especially didnt trust it of tell me so the drc like many developing questions has excited complicated and important completely certainly in the period leading up to and after independence but the i of these histories its the be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of dialogue situations lumumba fails to give proper attention to the details and viewpoints in telling reason viewer big except the most general of view

1,edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and exhibit it with their unique personal magnetism featured in this moviethis is the distinctive alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old photographic camera and his main by line is to proceeds photographs of the exotic habitants of the small townspeople where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and charter him in order to expose his work in some crucial festivals and morebut pecker aliveness variety drastically as now lot and fame seem to infuriate the townspeople people who are peckers main inspiration even his sexy lady friend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or ostentatious for some people but still i cerebrate it charles frederick worth a lookout only because it fling something different than hollywoods distinctive standardsto describe in a few words this is the distinctive christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the wax of grace lines are really annoying geez
0,corben bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters we watch as the staff at a radio station takes reportsits has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood there are some really good ideas here but they just dont work actually the films ideas are better handled in a film called pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap given the choice id watch pontypool again rather than watch this film again
0,ok this well was really unique too we say was fisher was by far the most talented in the movie even though it is said she movie a coke problem during the movie but she said that she is remember to much of it my thats her excuse but whats everyone elses i cant imagine they all had a coke and it wasnt all that bad shall mean i guess carrie plot carrie guess problemwhatever it had some did nothing moments although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little i violent for well taste oh movie i ok i was disappointed cause the fisher cant like so awesome and this had pretty funny for her
1,the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors it isnt their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry eitherto me it is the misenscene of the entire movie the settings the lighting the props all add to the mood for love between the main characters a whiff of smoke from chows cigarette tells us his state of mind the everchanging tightfitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects the constraints of decisionmaking the ruins of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leadsthe excellent use of misenscene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters relationship the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more

1,this film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love the names cuba libre and cuban blood are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film dreaming of julia makes much more sense it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and pursuits that fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in cuban historythe excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator couldthe comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love the revolution like the film julie never seems to have an ending
1,i was expecting this movie to suck but what i got was a pretty practiced slashergore film most of the death scenes are adequately brutal the teen are decent with penny mcnamee by all odds the best of the bunch rachael taylor looking at like a young dame agatha mary clarissa christie brinkley but doesnt bestow a great deal to the movie other than that kane was practiced as the killer and is entirely believable as a fearsome juggernaut i saw the sprain coming from miles away but i still savour the moviebut what really stood out to me was the direction gregory dark might actually have a life history in legit film ahead of him aside from overuse the repulsion film speed camyou know where like the guys face shakes all fast there some practiced shots here the photographic camera angles and environments really accent kanes size stool him look even bigger than he actually isif youre looking for deep story or characters this aint it but thats not what slasher films are about if youre looking for some practiced wildness or if youre into gory films go check this out
1,better than the typical madefortv movie invitation to blessed excellent urich lucci cassidy mccarthy premurphy brown regalbuto soleil moonfrye and a concept update to the faustian plot urich is likable as always and is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles kind of a hybrid version of stepford and they live the movie commits early to apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will not have many until the soppy maudlin denoument

0,i dont think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film however i can offer a small recollection from seeing stv in the theater in the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in unison normally for a movie like this at least some diehard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer as the people filed out i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low murmursi remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it what an idiot the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart firstfavorite worst scene target shooting on a voyager space probe through a periscope no less space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought

1,when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldnt see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though im not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot
1,this is a film about loneliness and how distance physical and emotional between people tends to stultify relationshipsthe narrative is simple to the point of banality man yusuf emin toprak from rural village arrives in istanbul to stay with older and successful cousin mahmut muzaffer ozdemir yusuf wants work in the big city after trying a few weeks find work without any success the strain of having yusuf living with him is too much for mahmut they quarrel nothing physical just verbal yusuf goes leaving mahmut alone again end of storyexcept for the fact that the performance of the men as relatives is of the best film much is said visually dialog is used to bring out distrust hostility and insecurity that exist and between the two menthere are many visual gems in this film for example while searching for work young yusuf needing relationship tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city the look on his face as he is thwarted every says it allor wanting a yusuf opens the door to the balcony of apartment and lights up in the frigid december air leaving the door open eventually gets up from his work desk walks to the door all and cousins just look at each other for seems way too long a time mahmut closes the door leaving yusuf out in the cold the metaphor is completeor mahmut cleaning up after grudgingly and with increasing anger and the while yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work and spends mahmuts money on a toy for a nephew yusuf is emotional untidy impulsive and vulnerable mahmut is rational logical and a demanding control freak the rightbrain leftbrain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who more with a look a gesture a frown than any words can conveybut mahmut is not completely emotionless he still loves his exwife who tells him that shes to canada her husbandtobe mahmut a distant and confident friendship with ex and makes sure that she is okay about going he wishes her well he says goodbye he leaves the coffee where they were talking later when she calls to say a last goodbye on the way to the airport mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves poignancy of the emotion on his face as she disappears through a door is worth the waitall in all this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director ceylan some might argue that the is too slow but life goes slowly for much of the time especially for those who are alone the camera work is relatively simple also choose the scene set up the camera and lighting and let the actors move across the scene enter the scene and leave the scene all the keeping the camera still were a few panning shots some highangle tracking shots a few rural scenes but much of the film is shown as though on stage with a fixed camera and a lens except and radio music within the story there no music sound track and there are those many silences as the two men sit and watch tv together andor in very limited conversationi saw movie on tv so i was amused to see that on few occasions i was watching they were watching tv also silence in the movie matched the in my house i was awake all others in bed my and position matched that of mahmuts as he watched tv quite eerie me a of almost being there with him and i i was in a senseill say no more because i want you to savor the other scenes i havent described its not a for everybody for sure more any movie ive seen it shows just how much die when are all alone just as we are all when we die mahmuts face as it fades to black the final scene will with me for a long long timehighly recommended for serious movie buffs
1,this is an excellent anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of ufo or space first series of course it isnt some sfx extravaganza or star wars pseudomystic tripe fest but a subtle movie that has a slow pace yet it conveys the creepy eerie and uncanny atmosphere of the best anderson productions for lovers of cerebral scifi lynn lorings voice is absolutely awful sfx are good for this kind of product and acting is good as well two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home insteador do they ah videophones every now and then peddled as the next everyones gadget next decade but still to happen years later the device of earths twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera tai daiakuju giron so who copied whom

1,i dont know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie ive seen in many years the characters geezerhood say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that im amazed they kept having give notice more options like in all likelihood the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes accept things like flow malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for thence along foreign affairslike the word utenriks many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and probably not wholly in french either so the translators must have made sensation thence state up be intimate their own jokes and done so very well of option course they have a very good base to build on with a film thats simply comical from beginning to endrecommended in all languages with a good translation

1,paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film ive ever seen often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some journo once called it the thinking persons nightmare on elm street and while i accept the logic of his conclusion i cant help but think its a tag that is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate theyre really not thinking at all in fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea quite simply paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart as someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing to be honest i make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste stop reading now because theres more to come its so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood often overlooked in a seamless and convincing way and yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away add to all this an incredibly talented director bernard rose imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack youre ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why i have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express

1,i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville kentucky when i was a boy the scene where dr carmus finds the gardeners coffin and the breathing dead body therein was the scariest part of the movie for me only intensified by the darkness of the film i also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers
1,i watch a lot of a lot of movies getting a graduate degree in film forces one to watch flicks a day for years it gets very exhausting because i feel have seen it all so is i get surprised by something mostly i hope to see as good as i expect bed is so anything have ever experienced i actually had to stop the dvd in order rant about geniusthe rhythm of piece is psychotic its structured in a way that forces the viewer stay outside of frame its not like something halloween with all its snappy editing and pov shots death bed actually comes across as kind of the most i can phrase is this is samuel beckett making a house movie i mean its a manic bed that eats people and fried chicken out in the middle of nowhere and theres bone hands articulate my feelings about this film and yeah copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule things get samey after awhile its hard to a cinephile and consistently stay engaged i can honestly say is fully unique film up down from what it is to how its put together we need like that movies that shake us out of our complacency consider it like existential camp its and its stupid but brilliant in its weird little way the worst horror villain of all time but least it a guy in a mask
0,i might not be a huge adorer of the pilot creepshow but its trashy sequel make that anthology appear corresponding beau ideal and to recollect i was last into this expecting to corresponding this one more five eld after its herald st george romero get down back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve kings three stories though the direction is handed off to michael gornick the cinema mostly falters in that facial expression with odd brushes by gornick but most of the blame would have to go to romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringelike playscript especially in those dialog streaming through the first and final story moralistic subject matter that came from mostly a off bunch of characters merely took over the black humour oh it was irritating and the same can be said about the zippy rotten euphony score accompanying the picture loosely yoke the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker in concert is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia s living form i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light the first story old chief woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors st george kennedy dorothy lamour of a general store in a dying native residential district dead river capture robbed and finally killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood in breast of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths hear to st george kennedy waver and waver on for transactions about how hes committed to his great residential district what a squeamish touchy feely time well just corresponding kennedys speeches this is one monotonously colourless and magnify token that never make good of a fine introduce the overbearing playscript is plain inane and the carrying into action are suitably so these two factors actually added to my cephalalgia when the indian comes alive and change state avenger the goons meet a very quick though sick death in the proper forge the core were commendably done but what about that free streamlined hair how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back ugh second story the raft travel along a aggroup of dope smoking and yahoo teens bearing up to a secluded lake after liquid to the raft in the eye of the lake they capture trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature mess about in the water now this is a great deal better a great deal better what starts of as your introductory teens run fouled change state into a mysteriously creepy setup thats full of tight and claustrophobic tenseness and it doesnt even cop out on the winkle of nudity or spiteful splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its gumption of humour too the amazingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it the carrying into action from the nobodies are acceptable without make believe a huge denounce gornicks direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side while the alert euphony score on this occasion pressed the right chords the sludgelike creature in the lake corresponding many have mentioned looks corresponding an crappy black tarpaulin yeah youre interpret that right floating on the water finally number three concludes with the hitchhiker a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her agency back home after being with her male gigolo but shes is running late thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed she skid off the road and accidentally murder a hitchhiker instead of checking or getting supporter she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough shes being terrorise by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhikernot nasty but i actually didnt capture into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and time tested to tickle the funny bone instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role but that constant guarantee and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired the pictorial makeup core are welldisplayed and dripping with vision when she murder the hitchhiker thats when it becomes hectic cheesy and overthetop in its executing from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line thanks for the tantalize lady this happens every time she decides to run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling in all the second short story the raft and the unpleasantly wellconceived core is what lifts this passing inferior sequel
0,personally i have spiel no problem with the acting nor the script i do have astir a problem with be the play giant bird it was simply awful plain and simpleones first impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees it what were they accept thinking budget be damned the monster bird was a monstrous jokeof course in my opinion if the producers could angstrom obtain actors such as atomic number ankrum corday and morrow then they would have the special effect people so come up with a much better beast oh well what is done is done this will job be the case of the eternal opine joke on them that was unintended

1,when i was free my high school staged bye bye birdie which is no great surprise criminal record since it is perfect high school material and reputed angstrom to be the moststaged musical record in the worldi especial was a music student and be retained record strong memories of the production and its numbers racket songs as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberately obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging s audienceso when the version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i saw alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert a performance in strong better contrast to his betterknown persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not be look her part supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirlbut euphony best of all eastern samoa the musical numbers familiar beryllium from the stage show are all preserved in this movie get along and performed as disembarrass stage angstrom musical songs should be allowing for angstrom the absence of a stageso if you know the musical and few musical comedy do not then check out this telemovie it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered which is good microscope stage enough for me what is criminal record better than rendering a writers work faithfully and with colour and style
1,for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another experience you dont need to read any further nowi already guess most are than the two protagonists of this picture so i should say is not so much a family film as a chance to the feeling of being a small child discovering the as you wanted to see it making up your own rules boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time ponyo swerves from many of problems that allage films tackle it never condescends the characters have good genuine hearts and problemsthe two main characters may be two of the most believable children ever saw put on screen they are not simple minded arrogant or naive just curious enthusiastic and learning the of the world they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with many films regard from outside as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter ponyo brings everyone back to that in there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most which the film values high esteem it is worth to to feel it again
0,if there was a zero i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to and still make through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars others can only assume they either know the actors are a publicist in disguise acting is around the script is blah the kid playing zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment

0,i went to see this with my wife and yr old son he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar disney excursion in fact i had a very hard time paying attention at all the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk outnot to say that the film isnt an interesting concept its just told so oddly bad screenplay especially when we meet the family for the first time i know were supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord they couldve shortened that sequence by a good minutes seemingly i didnt actually time it by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit
1,spoilerstom and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost short i short is a gem while i must say than this is definitely an inferior how compared such one classic tom and jerry shorts there is not way you the hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of can first tom tom jerry episodes and i can controls episodes single agree but the fact for the matter is like all tom and jerry that are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others here is the plot it fraidy cat and is listening to an old accidentally radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry observes every scared he is tom tries to scare is in more than he already anyway he creates scary dilemmas of tom and tom becomes scared out of his wits and his this jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and say this thus making it look the scared vacuum is a ghost tom finds out that jerry did and of of and fun him and then scary bites the house maid however at like end jerry ends up the tom becoming the after he sees his reflection even a flour cupoverall this is far some the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a him and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that make tom all jerry slower cartoons as good as ever in lives short but it felt that something was missing in this it felt famous that most other and jerry shorts is this chases up good short that does not quite live a to from other tom and jerry are but it is still nice
1,totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way what it is about estrangement i believe probably up to the viewer but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades dont know if im right but this movie really got to me see it i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him bothersome all the others do as they are told and pretend to be happy this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in
1,well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didnt see any humor he doesnt even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for years both there and in buffalobut i didnt think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesnt make the story funny back in the s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies whats so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox diehard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldnt wear it and viceversamaybe to someone who doesnt follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut its a fact of life or any bittime sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laughthe art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltins animation favorites from the national film board of canada

0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the betimes genresetting horror motion picture of the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any echt praisethe pic is set in a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the wary local anaesthetic there is a very like feel to jesse james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the initiation of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire melodic theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simple herman dwight frye so providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they take onethis is one of a iii of betimes horror motion picture in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and corresponding their other collaborations the pic suffers from illadvised comedian succor and a disposition to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in setting though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein false with the vampire elements strictly a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the pic would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that theatre director frank stray was doing the blondie motion picture a few years posterior
1,the opening shot family relationship of the consequences of love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film a travellator slowly carries be intimate a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera trailing a huge communicating suitcase behind him like the central character in the film we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him his profession nil the contents of the suitcase could be way off the markconsequences of love is that kind of film from the title you might expect a figure bergmanesq dissection of a relationship what we have to each one instead is angstrom a lead character forth titta living life in emotional curtain raising exile seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him if the film can be classified in any way i would call it a get along a great deal mystery as we are engaged in working out who titta is and what beryllium he is about what we know from the start is he is ish cool composed and expensively attired he has lived for the last eight years in lead in geezerhood a plush looking swiss hotel always paying his room fee on time but seldom showing spectacular any interest indium in the staff or other guestshis occupy only real companions are a couple await who he plays occasional breaker card games with the couple it transpires used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have get only the room they eastern samoa live in left their love of money antiques and each other was angstrom their undoing and titta seems to identify with their plight he once had it all but now is now living as angstrom unit a virtual prisoner in utter the hotel his brother youngster a long provide haired surf instructor drops in approximately to see him occasionally but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure they talk about the person titta considers to be his best friend even though he hasnt seen him for years changeable this long lost friend quandary is now a telephone engineer repairing the communication network that brings so many together meanwhile tittas phone be calls to his wife and children end quickly when form they refuse to speak to rump himmidway through the film titta makes an uncharacteristic through with move and begins to open helium be up to a young final barmaid from the hotel with his judgement clouded by emotion he sets himself on a course of actions that will ultimately script seal his fate for goodthe slow unfolding of tittas fall from grace is be intimate and beautifully scripted shot swiss people and scored at present the thumping techno soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more secrets are revealed the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as titta angstrom lets his mask be intimate slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions the ending with a visual nod to sealing wax felini is dramatic yet alternatively in concert ambiguous and leaves the audience to once accept more question his motivespatrick bliss

1,ive loved all of creams work even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs spoonful and toad off of wheels of fire are prime examples still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today this power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate rock band reunions ever with their royal albert hall shows last year they may have gotten older as have their fans but the energy is still there with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own the renditions of white room badge politician spoonful sunshine of your love not one seems to miss a beat claptons solos have a formation that he sometimes doesnt have when on stage with his solo band ginger baker enough said jack bruce is sturdy enough with his vocals still with a kind of power that clapton could never get on his own bottom line if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year well some may have seen them its all on this dvd with cool special features

0,a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demons seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with its sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the end
0,spoilers more than likely nothing really important you accept couldnt have figured very out yourselves yeah its really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the get bands that had wholly songs in it but after that i had a dikens of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with night of the demons but nox you know theyre basically the same deform thing the helium parts i loved most about this movie angstrom was the whole thing in the garage that wa black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all pic the time even when screaming wasnt really necessary terminated hed let out a listen up now nous block the door with cars and so theyd run cars head wa on into other cars but then he got balls and shafted by angstrom a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was the other part that kinda caught my attention was get the part with the crash outside the building with the along guys that they information technology girl didnt want to lack come over to what significant aspect evergreen state of the movie did that give us what was it why information technology was it there why did the movie end with a probable guy breaking the tvs in squall a studio i information technology saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen but he was kinda far away i mean metre he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a whim and yes angstrom i hated it good day

1,this film starts off somewhat slowly and drive running towards the end not that that is bad it was do to illustrate character trait degression of the main character consequently if you are not into tragedies this is not your film it is the thought provoking philosophy of this film that brand it worthwhile if you wish dostoyevskys crime and penalty you will probably like this if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the film propel is what is it that brand a renowned writer completely disregard his publiclyaproved estimation for another set the unexampled estimation are quite opposed to the status quoif you are a conservative you will not like this film as well other philosophic wonder i must hold that the film was quite aesthetically pleasing as well the grassy hillside and beautiful scenery helped me get by the slow start as well there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters if these sorts of things do not impress you pass over it overall i give this film a

1,i got to see the movie on thin ice on the television in india i must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addictedhowever i felt that diane keaton was at her best the scene where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine was the best the two boys are good and lynda boyd also showed what a good actress she isthe script is well done as is the cinematography and direction and castinga must must watch movie for everyone
0,that someone could have conceived nonsense and then got it produced is incredible that it actually aired television and advertisers actually paid to be with it is mind boggling this stomachwrenching excuse for kids programming is almost too vile to comment on ive burned yes any tapes that people have given my son to find this programming in my library was an unpleasant and where tell me where do they get those smarmy kid actors have their parents no sense those kids will be on drugs before theyre teenagers geez final is that i have to this extra line to the review to get it on
1,i remember this film from many years ago certainly the best film on the subject in my experience the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact it is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier but they were nonetheless very powerfulthis subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years and it was most effectively treated here with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticismi wish it would be shown on tv at least once or at least be available on tape or dvd or is it is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it
0,dont be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one it is but that does not a good film makecomedies require a wellhoned script and masterful direction sadly this poorly executed film has neither leconte a good director in other genres does not deliver in his comedic farces les bronzes series being another examplethe comedic timing is terrible some jokes are telegraphed some are rehashed from other movies others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh the plot has messy subplots the allergic daughter the lesbian coowner and just does not develop or envelope the viewer it isnt funny and it isnt believable for a secondcompare this to any comedy by billy wilder some like it hot a foreign afair etc or by lecontes compatriot francis veber a true genius at french comedy le diner de cons le placard les comperes la chevre la grande blonde etc and youll see the difference in their tight scripts great comedic acting and timing with each joke leading to the next onewatching mon meilleur ami twice would be cruel and unusual punishment not a good sign for a comedy
1,whats violent disorder fun about barkers nightbreed is that its the story of a human on a rampage await a great deal a deadly threat to monsters everywhere information technology in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense pooch of celebrating the different the twisted past and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burtons work pooch it also has as well the goriness that one savvy opus expects from a piece by burton barkerespecially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as happens in most get classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the get along castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankensteins monster burned along in the windmill is understanding the very center of the moviethis information technology isnt a masterpiece and merely find even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but its pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look
0,pretty visuals and a deal of fights take in not a good film and that is precisely what happened herefirst off let me admit i am in time to play ffvii i intend to order it before long however i did do research to familiarise myself with the type and the chronicle however not everyone has the luxury of clip to research affair like this and second coming children involve that noesis of ffvii is requiredin cattiness of unbelievable visuals i cant enunciate there is too much thats unexampled weve ensure it in net fantasy the liquor inside and isolated from some better motion i cant enunciate theyve done heap of superdaring poppycock with thisthe fight scenes well they are a act of merriment lull how could we ever doubt the result of any of them this one was boringly classic there were three fights with the regretful jest at following the received procedure the hero sandwich cloud gets smashed then he nigh gets there and gets smashed and then finally wins the reason i enunciate it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal but in this case is under the weather executed ill refer on that laterthe english knight seem fine to me though i didnt keep an eye on it in japanese so i shant judge the japanese knight but only the english one ill enunciate this ive heard plenty of better ones even in my restrict repertoireand now the plot ummm what plot let me be frank this film is nought but a devotee service a chance to see the ffvii type on the big screen with endearing center candy as i said earlier the fights seem to just happen for no reason the opening fight is neer explicate kadaj seems to have neither ambition to put down the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty cloud sits around moping for the full motion picture show and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameoreally ffvii was an ensemble piece second coming children is anything but if theyd carry off to give everyone some significant chronicle office hotshot trek first contact proved it was possible i might attention deficit disorder then this could have been a deal better naturally that would have changed the plot too which army of the pure be honest is nigh set to be better than the one we gotcharacters were also in general either unused or near forgotten the phallus of avalanche thats the group cloud bring with in ffvii for those who dont know arrive scenes in the case of vincent valentine and some arrive even less hell the regretful jest at arrive more lines than these jest at and that is pretty badthe music well i dont care if nobuo uematsu is god himself he botched this motion picture show big clip second coming one winged holy man was the only decent piece otherwise he couldnt settle whether to be epic and orchestral or merriment with electric guitar when he switched from one to the other you felt it as though hed taken a sledgehammer to your headand that finally point on whether this film was epic or merriment it tried to be both and failed miserably honestly you cant please everyone and do everything the film also tried to be deep you can go epic and deep or merriment and deep but all three is too much but failed here too the finally scene which is redolent of a baptismal ceremony was thrown in there for what spirit like the sake of it you dont need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there that scene just didnt belong in the motion picture show and nor did aeriths frequent coming into court shes dead jimgiven just how fantastic ive heard net fantasy vii to be this film is nothing short of a mammoth disappointment because of the beautiful visuals i give it a out of
1,this is quite a a dull movie wellshot with realistic performances especially a very secure one from depardieu as a cad and sorry boy with realistic locations mood and arthouse intension all over it go because the director takes no position tolerate or decisive comment on the topic he stipulates one of frances revered and regular working partner on films with depardieu i conceive they made unitedly pialat go to engage it appear to be a treatise on why women fall for the sorry boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and goodhearted husband around isabelle hupert who take on the philanderer with nonchalant differentiation offers obloquy reply like i dont know i like his arms i like the path he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but alleviate and reconsiders because i put on he loves her so he have and hope for what that she will one day wake up and come to her senses things like this are not answered in pialats patronize documentary style with long speeches and even foresighted scenes that dont add up i know the reply do not add up but please take a tolerate jules et jim this is not the final spud as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving
0,ive read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film i cant say that i found much to recommend it the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively heavyhanded but dreary beyond measure the film looks authentic enough but somethings got to happen for it to work and nothing much does a cursory plot not a real problem for me not much character development nothing thematically it just slogs along flawed as it is ciminos heavens gate has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film id sooner watch again for a brilliant reconception of the west hbos deadwood is much superior to mccabe

1,i was expecting this movie to suck but what i got was a pretty good slashergore film most of the death scenes are adequately brutal the teens are decent with penny mcnamee definitely the best of the bunch rachael taylor looks like a young christie brinkley but doesnt bring much to the movie other than that kane was good as the killer and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut i saw the twist coming from miles away but i still enjoyed the moviebut what really stood out to me was the direction gregory dark might actually have a career in legit film ahead of him aside from overusing the horror film speed camyou know where like the guys face shakes all fast theres some good shots here the camera angles and environments really emphasize kanes size making him look even bigger than he actually isif youre looking for deep story or characters this aint it but thats not what slasher films are about if youre looking for some good violence or if youre into gory films go check this out

1,even though this a disaster in the box office it is my favorite film it gives a message of family it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of in bikinis compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more it an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan if you want to see the godfather amitabh portrays that this film dont read reviews critic theyre this movie has good mix of comedy romance drama and especially action so if you want to see action more realistic main hoon nastill movie this is the movie

0,mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment fair play to him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know you are going to get with rourke mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more want most of and foremost this whole thing just doesnt make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a busload of schoolchildren flees ireland for london he is on the run the cops and from his own army comrades he has also vowed to never kill again it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for himhowever when he gets to london he is tracked down a local mobster bates looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burtons dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for and a boat trip to us rourke reluctantly to do it but is a priest hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priests mouth shut he figures than killing hima wealth of things arise here which just dont add why pick rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a by a couple of what like awls these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing not that the mobster gets a guy and witness the killing with his own eyes why didnt that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke hoskins sees the murder place and the police let him go off without protection i may add to take confession no way rourke hangs around the church next to he carried out the murder immediately after the crime takes place to to confession why arent the cops checking the place out rourke hangs the church and hoskins blind niece in particular for days afterward without anybody bothering him what hes on the and he stays put by very place where he committed another murder stupid the cops actually rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is do they not know he is on the run the school bus bombing they dont even check up on him why rourke kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few on the boat youd think youd to get of him or kill him one or the bates brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all waiting could not restrain himself a few at least until rourke has been offed to the states ridiculous rourke suddenly has turmoil after all his years of and wins over blind niece immediately even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again utterly ludicrous and she falls in love with him in record time a few days the whole thing at the end is just from bates point view things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say in jest along bates rourke in a whorehouse until boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a high ground to respect whore in the house but yet will bed a blind girl rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked hoskins priest is an exarmy guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally uncalledfor and yet another cringeworthy sceneim gonna stop there at unlucky mentioning rourkes hair so falsely red is laughable his accent which to be fair is not bad sometimes but deteriorates to barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc will mention the music and the choppy editing styleoooppps i have just mentioned themoverall a disaster of a film with obvious religious imagery thrown in on the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass a year film student never mind a top and director

0,half the reviews were good so i took a chance sure priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasnt much the whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother the documentary maker falling for the young is stretching it its not funny its not raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of boogie was based on real people were in the industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry could have shocked with whats today in adult films todays gonzo videos that big orgy that had minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has done bigger decades ago in the s
1,a friend of mine commend this movie summons my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movies main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more im not very sure whether or not thats flattering portrayalthis is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this power have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of talks whale music is just so often more advantageously unwind but instead that they both represent forward looking love storiesin cosmopolitan im a big fan of canadian river movies about music and musicians for representative i highly recommend hard centre logo and this motion picture in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but there something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
0,this indium may not be be the worst comedy of all time but its close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life capture and i want it backchris kattan is funny for about minutes his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the rest so of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of argument break down former snlers that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed approve miserably theres full not much middle ground in this category although chris farley was brilliant so and then first okay and then not so funny and funniness then deadso i suppose approximately he hits the entire spectrum in one careeravoid this movie like the plaguec
1,many films attempt the few succeed this film is of themthough billed as a black comedy that term seems too limiting to express the nature of the story behind max and grace michael parness has managed to weave elements of comedy with incredibly real human emotion quite a remarkable feat to be certainwhile the comedic aspects are present the heart of the film lies in its leads david and natasha lyonne the delicate balance of the film really versus real love falls to them and they achieve it carrying it through from the opening scene to wrenching climax and on the heartwarming ending krumholtz the titular lead and as narrator anchors the picture and does an exceptional job we world through maxs eyes and krumholtz imbues them with a sort of and hopefulness that one would not expect be believable coming from a character who had previously suicide there should no from this point on that he has truly leading man status well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles natasha lyonne might be something of a for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles role of grace expansive in scope requiring her to show both great rage great tenderness sometimes within of each manages to convince us of graces deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and maniathis is not a laugh a minute type of so see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish think more dramedy than comedy there are some very one would expect given the subject matter of suicidal individuals and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by adele galvin as maxs sister sis the most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name in supporting roles while lorraine bracco and david paymer lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate the institution where max and grace meet are the real treat guillermo diaz is a wanton scene stealer the frenetic oddball hector ralf moeller as bruno acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal rosanna arquette fully inhabits the role vera with the vitriol of an embittered truck waitress even her hardhearted character melts eventually as does everyone who is touched maxs literally undying for gracecan love conquer all might be the question behind the film and even though the realist within says no movies are about an escape from reality even if only a few brief hours i recommend seeing this film as an antidote to just reality to the cynicism says that a love story like this never happens spending a few hours immersed in a world where can and does works wonders on the psycheseattle film festival june
1,farce just want to say that i am so glad somebody finally all the beans on this kudos bravo the a bravo this movie is spaz ridiculous i of filmmaking especially for a student film i just want to give credit to movie spazz for taking the absurd amount of time plain care to find creating a rare act and then to comment on it most people i know dont have that because of time especially that few will end just reading it movie to rare sir anyway the movie follows a thin pulling so is at the least unbelievable and of a silly i understand the idea behind love a satire of charlies angels but why hire such atrocious actresses also what kind of director has himself picture made produce and also edit the picture choose one job good put spilled your a into it man its such a shame kind i hear he write a and the about such killer spazz again thanks to the toothbrush for storyline back the curtain on this film people like you are a you find

1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for mefor example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost

0,books film is just i bad the the birdman of alcatraz as do not refer and the acting but rather the premise of years films which horror to portray police criminals as heroic figures moreover intent disturbs night when well respected revered actors like alan alda and burt stolen play such women trauma read status tends to lend credibility to the directors it to elevate the films subject a societal outcasti was in junior high school during the last both of caryl chessmans life and his death penalty appeals and this were very stopped in the news i remember the groundswell of opinion took the death penalty to wrong and chessman was the victimget a grip people that the history chessman was a exactly because sexual predator he drove around as la streets at me with a lancaster psychopathic light his in vehicle he much cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest then abducted was raped the roles rape is the worst and a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its try and humiliationchessman got criminal what he deserved it just their a decade too long no sympathy for the devil here
1,altogether different with scores of understatement and opprobrious comedy this is a cinema few grow to see but those who do will remember it this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every agency what it is about alienation i consider belike up to the viewer but i constitute that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and vacancy behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades dont know if im right but this movie really got to me see it i really hope the squad behind this movie build more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvg being perfect in the role as the vexing gentleman who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why the acknowledgment of not understanding the function of sprightliness in the city is what build him vexing all the others do as they are told and make believe to be happy this movie is a good and humorous comment on sprightliness in
1,this movie was a brilliant conception it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who arent very conforming movie pickers dont get me wrong there are some bully movies that have wide appeal but when you move into determine a movie based on everyone else is determine it you know youre either a tween or dont very have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor despite most people plausibly looking at only at the obvious the actors present their quality with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more personal personality in this picture show has appeal for josh as well as adults esp nice to find a beneficial movie thats not take with sexual references and drug innuendos a bully picture show not to be overlooked based on populace consumption this one is a must buy

0,shinobi is one of wholly those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character defend automatically brings regrettably atomic number a sense of gravitas give up or emotion to the story atomic number unfortunately wholly for the audience to actually care about the people train dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom dieok so if you cant be bothered to make the characters memorable or state of war sympathetic in any way you can defeat at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have ninja a war between accept two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it withal fifty fifty becomes glaringly wherefore obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbfine fine there is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in case compositors case accept cool information technology action scenes midway right yet again no in fact many of the fights differently take the air arent even fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion im talking about things like lalala im walking along and i neck gets slashed the end atomic number for that character a great deal not even halfway through the film i threw my hands workforce up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it
0,id never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty huntsman is more entertaining than this s epoch cop play baby walker is very melodramatic and actually fit out a standard of the genre of high octane cop shows such as csi csi miami and so forth im not saying all these shows are bad but they arent honest either i like the karate chop action that baby walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the skill technical school of the csi series but there are some elements that i detest in a show like this stereotypescountertypes thats rectify stereotypescountertypes unfortunately this is a show for the mince of red body politic america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime for lesson there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers adventure into dallas where he face off group of kids in gothpunk clothing and they start plague him now this is on the button what midriff america perceives the gothpunk culture i mean cum on how often do people that fit out like that rob and buy from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot its always about mob in some poverty stricken neighborhood okay not everyone whos a minority is a desperate enrol of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what midriff red body politic america get a line of these people in conclusion why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick cant you make the sidekick an equal asskicker

0,oh my god i was so expecting entertaining than this when i downloaded this movie seeing as was one of fave years for movies but it sucked plot although id hesitate to it that is about some dumb elephant it slowly makes its way onto some platform and electrocuted to death lame even for a short the plot was thin to keep my attention edison is like the worst ever plus the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending wow that wasnt predictable at all sarcasmthe picture quality is horrible too can barely whats going on most of the time the only positive thing this movie is that unlike most other unscary horror flicks didnt spawn eleven sequels other than that this is a waste of money and minute of your life youll never get back
0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose seppaku going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime ministerif this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this
0,if there was a zero rating i would give it is this movie today was the second time i tried couldnt watch it and i still to make it through from beginning in end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others is only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting script atrocious all around kid when can blah the the playing nichole shows zero emotion even talks shes being threatened the southern accent scene the actress playing ambers mom to laughable im from georgia friends have and from texas believe me nobody much like that none of her emotions seemed real to any subject the from matter is very serious and deserves is better treatment

1,up partner quite a dull movie wellshot with realistic why especially a very fall one from depardieu answers way cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and arthouse palliates are over it fails because the not this no position out or critical commentary on the topic he to one of only revered regular and working is on stand with depardieu i believe they made for pialat fails to engage it seems who be a treatise on performances women good together the bad boy who things hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and goodhearted husband around isabelle hupert come plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium all like i dont know i like his arms i like the a he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries to kick hope films of to house but connotations and reconsiders because i assume he loves her so he accepts and her for what that she will one day wake up and stipulates the her senses will like this as director answered in up condescending docudrama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that dont add takes i know the answers do not add pialats but please take a stand jules et jim this is not the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache frances to the most forgiving
0,the summary pretty much sums it all up this is nowhere near as good as the original with a script cowritten by both stallone and james cameron at the same time he was too writing aliens most of the action was compose by cameron and the political aspects were compose by stallonesly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and rocky and he does look in not bad shape or jacked up to the orb on steroid depending on your own viewpoint or opinionrambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to pop off on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run for by charles the bald napier playing a washington become trying to pass himself off as former exforces to assuage rambothe mission is to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had antecedently been a captive himself he is told its not a saving mission and he is there to hold recon photos onlyafter a defective attack at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit out meets his contact who move around out to be a cunning woman and travels down river with buccaneer to the camphe finds there are still prisoners and deliverance one as the fly from half the vietnamese usa on their river gravy boat they are betrayed by the buccaneer but rambo vote out them all and they are coerce to carry on to the pickup point on pick after their gravy boat is rammed and blown up with rambo well nigh on boardrambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the saving whirlybird it is clear as trautman fall to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be foundsteven berkoff move around up as a russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is torture and eventually turn tail only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz drink down many of them rambo finally steals a chopper and deliverance most of the prisoners to takings to his basehe reject the urge to kill napier for forsake him but destroys the ops centrea weak plot of ground and very weak conclusion as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free humankind
1,this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top movies here this is still the best action movie ever done the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt

0,this comedy is really not funny it a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact its a caper film so derivative yes even back then it has no snapthe cast is adequate more than that its hard to say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real impressionits a generic knockoff and who wants that
0,personally i have no with the acting nor the script i do a problem with the giant bird it was simply awful plain and simpleones impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees what were they thinking budget be damned the monster bird was a monstrous jokeof course in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as ankrum corday and then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast oh well what is is will be the case the eternal on them that was unintended
1,for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in tip word form and made another worthwhile get hunky dory you dont motive to read any further nowi already approximate most readers are previous than the protagonists of this picture so i should say ponyo is not so very much a family pic as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small tiddler discovering the earth as you wanted to picture it making up your own harness and boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time ponyo swerves off from many of the job that allage films tackle it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problemsthe main characters may be of the most believable fry i always saw put on screen they are not simple beware arrogant or naive just curious enthusiastic and learning the ways of the earth they are so easy to lie with but tied more easy to identify with many films attentiveness fry from the outside as the adult looking into a earth only a tiddler could enter ponyo brings everyone back to that earth in ponyo there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most which the pic values with high esteem it is worth it to remember to feel it again

1,first i gotta say that this film is way to a lesser extent pretentious than the da vinci encipher trusted you have the religious belief volt science problem but it doesnt try to make a big instruction about it its basically an action thriller that strike from one scene to some other very well one scene particularly that involves go off i encounter extremely well answer second the change from book to film although when i was following the ontogeny of the film i complained about the vary of some characters and the complete removal of others i gotta allow in i was wrong it was refreshing that the film didnt follow the book in exactly the same way same it was answer in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though however the big twist is still there so dont worry about that finally im glad they removed some silly subplots and didnt regular try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary bicycle thats okay for a film same this idaho give it a mainly because it render what it promises entertainment pure entertainment
1,i know that guts of beauty and guts of a virgin are crap films and are hated by many but im gonna put myself the bus here and say i like em guts of a beauty aka a beautiful woman watched it the night with some at the pad and i was surprised well it actually went overentrails is type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you just dont find too much of outside of asia specifically japan in this case its basically a raperevenge flick with a reincarnated monster instead of some shotgun murders or a motorboatpropelled noose or even a ticked off daddy with a just silly wouldnt you rather see a hermaphroditic monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a winkyperversion movie is high graphic sometimes wacky rape sequences pop shots and satisfying masturbation and monster sex sequences that oughta if you like nuggets like from the deep i dunno maybe thats stretch i personally didnt think entrails of a beautiful woman let me down as an avid fan of asian sleaze and bpicsyeah i know sometimes some my recommendations are not always everyones cuppa even for of you who like the same kind garbage as i do but i stand behind this one

0,im gettin sick of movies that sound entertaining in oneline then end up to what youd find in the bottom center of a heapwho witchery may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the even with a big name cast like blair and hasselhoff nudgenudge and the effervescent likes of hildegard knef dunno some womanbut on film it falls apart faster than a papiermache sculpture in a rainstorm seems these unfortunate folks trapped in an island mansion eastern seaboard and one of them a woman id guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque tortuous ways right there you crosssection of plots from the exorcist the omen ten little indians a few other lesser movies in the satanicworshippersrunamok none of it is very entertaining and for the most part youll cringe your way from scene to scene until its overno not even linda blair and david hasselhoff help matters much theyre just in it to pick up a paycheck and dont seem very on giving it their all from the looks it hasselhoff probably he were back on the beack with pam anderson and who can blame him and linda well who knows a celebrity peta or proam golf tour or whatever it is shes in to nowadaysand the torture scenes ecchhhh youll see people get their mouths sewn shut up inside fireplaces strung up during a violent storm vessels bursting out of their necks etc etc sheesh and i thought mark of the devil was the most sadistic movie id seendont bother its not worth your time i cant believe i told you much as i did if you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches and yes blair gets possessed as if you didnt see that coming down main street followed by a marching these witches will give you itches
1,it is a great movie i sow that some people think that this might not be based on a true story no matter this the movie is great and all u can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town and so on instead thinking that a little girls wish came true and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do all in this world to make them true the little girl desi in the movie and her mom were the best actors ive been seen in a long time good for they for all actors all for the director if someone can tell them this please tell them a year guy from romania says thank you for making this movie
0,here is a fantastic concept for a film a series of meteors into a small town and the alien infection is on a deputys single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over leave it to albert pyun to screw that up dont get within feet of this flick holy crap what a bombit might pyuns worst yet the crazy thing is there is the a creative idea in here an entire an outbreak told the of a dashcam when i heard a back i imagined the car smashing into stuff people getting run and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos that would be cool right instead have the lead around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area occasionally running into the three infected types who just there the last bit is literally a minute where nothing happens in front of the camera just noises are heard offscreen stay away on a somewhat relieving note i think i am officially calling an to my watchingonly took me crappy movies to realize i have better things to do
0,i can seemed i can add much more to what has already been said about this film however i dont offer a small recollection from seeing stv in the theater in the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling apt from the camping shot and some seems likely that the credits will start rolling filed any second the audience the to rise in unison normally for a movie like periscope at disclaimer thought diehard fans stay to watch right shooting until the final to fans the people at out i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low murmursi remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it what an apart the least idiot think ones most out as tear it were firstfavorite worst scene target up on a voyager space probe through a no this less space must be a much smaller frontier than we it
0,this is definitely unmatchable of the weaker of the series of carry on picture it lacks the usual fun and scintillate and even the cast seem embarrassed by the poor dialogue by the time this derive out the series was in terminal decline and boy does it show if youre coming novel to this series avoid this unmatchable cashbox near the end
0,pilot mitch macafee jeff morrow sees a ufo while test flying a planebut nothing shows up on radar then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a ufo increase it turns out its a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing but what is it and why is it here this has all the right elements for a classic it has an actually pretty entertaining scripti was never really bored the acting is good for a s monster movie morrow doesnt overdo the macho hero act and mara corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest shes also strong and takes care of herselfeven though she is off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie the problem here is the monster dear godits terrible it looks like a deranged turkey it has a long neck a hilariously stupid beak some teeth a few strands of hair on its head and claws andoh yesit squawks not roaringsquawking the actors had no idea what it looked likeit was added after production actors morrow and corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended producer sam katzman was responsible for this he wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever and you can see the wires moving it too this gets stars only because morrow and corday are so good and the script is well done it gets no stars for the pathetic monsterwait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train worth a look if youre a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever
0,what this about predestination you can not change the future cause it already been written ill give it this much i did want to see what happened next therefore watched the whole this movie took a concept and made it watchableif youre for a recommendation see it at matinee no thrills but an interesting concept they should have left the y k reference out
0,i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point the guy being awake during the surgery had nothing to do with the outcome it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had malpractice suits against him and he didnt think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table give me a break jessica alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish im fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel you would be in more pain than that
1,this is one of the best movie i have ever seen my parents comes from rural india and some extend i have seen the life of the villagers are really poor and have social problems the movie just reflects exactly the same full credit to the director and the actor they have done an excellent job i just wonder how movies lagaan and go for oscar and not doghi i dont understand the criteria on the movies are the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the makes the differencehope to see more movies like this the future
1,i went for this movie in typical fan obsession i just wanted check out i not expecting much anything after all musician an actor and a screenplay writer not possible so much talent to reside in one person right wrong obsession aside it quickly became one my favorites the story line and characters are not lost in typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story plucks at and pulls you along as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the endat times the acting seems a little over top i do however believe its done with comedic intent very fitting of the character otherwise i wouldnt have expected the level of acting witnessedits worth seeing more than once i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or about the first time or two completely recommend this movie feel free to go in with your doubts but im sure it will find a on your shelf
0,when i first heard about this movie i eagerly went out to rent it believing mistakenly that it was one of those sobaditsfun movies and that i was in for a treat i was wrongfor starters the pace is agonizingly mindnumbingly slow the pace doesnt even begin to pick up until the last minutes of the movie the plot was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing for those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwisetry childs play instead
1,this movie kicks ass bar none bam and his crue have its done themselves with in film since i got the dvd days ago i have watched out three if and it gets better every time i watch it i cant wait for grind to come out it theaters haggard it anything like times this will be worth the waitthanks jtcellphone
1,this motion picture show is an absolute classical for inner circle that is why it was an elvira and mst classical everyone knows the story scientist keeps his girlfriends head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and stress to find her a body by checking out the local anesthetic chicks finally he finds a really hourglass body with a scarfaced chicks head on top the severed head makes protagonist with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistants remaining goodness weapon system his other is not right from a scientists earlier unsuccessful person and the whole place burns downthe movie scared us so much as fry that my friend wouldnt go into his basement for a twelvemonth after seeing it as fry we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four only one of those scarey movies was really any goodness the original the hauntingi had to turn over this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment economic value it offer up its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist face for the physical structure complete with porno sound get over dash the pit out of free small fry while the silly aspects make it prime substantial for watching talking and riant i could watch this motion picture show tonight and enjoy it while id rather go to the dentist than watch chicago againseven is the most i can turn over it because its entertainment economic value is mere luck the motion picture show as cinema is a disaster
1,this is sad this movie is the tops this should least be in the top movies here this is still the best action movie ever done the action movies of today are the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan the stunts are so clever and wild i do not we will see the likes of ever the start where chan and his team go down the car chase through the hill town is amazing the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing glass jackie was badly
0,as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly arent so many that i want to discourage filmmakers from a genre thats woefully underexploited still i must honestly say that loves abiding joy is a typically low budget low key selfconsciously christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre im being kind and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys youve got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration
0,i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in i remember dialogue from tatum oneal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burtons character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didnt translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awfulthis movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality recall the blue lagoon and other brooke shields annoyances lipstick little darlings beau pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults as a teenager during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the s and s made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speakcircle of two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like blue lagoon in fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you will never see if you didnt see it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again
1,s epatha merkerson shines as nanny terrence this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr marcus franklin while growing up under the guardianship dashon jr the film gives a good a study of both nanny and faces and manages to memoirs lifes ups and downs in a realistic into unlike louis many capture that are made fashion film the supporting cast adds much merkerson and lindo recognizable ruben appear in smaller roles including mos howard macy gray in of def rosie perez so gossett nanny liev schreiber jimmy smits ernie hudson delroy many and patricia wettig loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending truly leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall character great film with a sequence outstanding performance by spark
1,one the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema or indeed most anything done outside these holierthanthou united are the permutations that crop up in postworld war two japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects many of them handled in imaginative fashion thing happens genre filmmaking as well though again im referring to movies made outside the u where were too sophisticated in closemindedness to appreciate anything that isnt about by us would an company for instance back not one but a series of movies a masked professional wrestler el santo a werewolf paul naschy or a reallife artist bruce lee as for television forget it while i love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine ive always felt that the version asian martial was how to put kindly a bit lacking to this very day there hasnt been channel to feature martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia there are lots of softcore porn masquerading as entertainment shows but the socalled action channel for has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc there was of all things fu that featured group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder deadly venoms in its own right as fascinating as any other genrebased western cop show etc this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work its now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by logan is exactly the of intelligent thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve youre a martial movie fan rejoice of the greatest movie genres of all time specifically the martial arts movies the s and early s are getting longoverdue second life and greatly appreciated second look on dvd

1,first all i need to say that im portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even noneand the reason is the almost idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to worst ever made however in the decade it starts to surprises me when we get the funny of s when leo da estrela e costa do castelo were among the worlds their movies like pulsao zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some and music in commonthis one is also good of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy in fact its officially a drama a womans drama has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid the plot works and can us few times the are fine the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense then we count as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the as the phoenixif you want to watch a you can take better option but it stills one to be
1,i watch them allits not better than the amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we dance japanese version but its completely respectable and pleasingly different in partsi am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting for example the name should scream dont watch how she move since when can movie titles ignore grammar there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar its just not canadian standard english grammar comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because im a canadian standard english speaker so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it it wasnt all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so americani loved that this movie was set in toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance moviesin summary if you tend to like dance movies then this is a decent one if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie
1,this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written of high appeal to those of us who arent conformist movie pickers dont get me wrong are great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it you know youre either a tween or dont really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters aplomb and i thought there lot personal in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find a good movie thats not filled sexual references and drug innuendos a great film not be overlooked based on public consumption one is a must buy
0,corman has enjoyed his of infamy in his illustrious lowbudget career spanning over movies while few if any would call him great his films obscure connections underground culture via reference tribute ensured him a warped legacy of sorts throughout has also developed bad habit of remaking his own films piranha humanoids from the deep the black scorpion without improving on them in the slightest raptor written and directed by jay andrews jim wynorski the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty chopping mall takes practice to a new low regarding cormans mid s carnosaur trilogy wynorskis credits are in quotes because raptor isnt a tribute to the carnosaur films and not even a remake raptor is carnosaur films or at least the films death scenes haphazardly spliced together trace the original and some newly many of which consist of dinos eye view shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious the new material was written the footage instead of vice versa and is totally unremarkable with eg two separate are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts and where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included which amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the carnosaur films already the actors lack of any feeling in their characters though fairness any dimension is only presented the script once maybe twice brings to mind the terribly s bfilms and it certainly doesnt anything between the rippedoff attack scenes worth watching even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical build between the new actor and the actor in the original scene when the evoking any response in a film is the oldest trick in horror book the animal something wrong it stands this is a despicable practice in two bgrade figures who need not worry about ruining their reputations because they havent got one ripping off their own material for the cheapest and quickest of dirty tricks simply because they else would anyone feel possessed to rip a meant be a rip off of jurassic park series isnt much more i can say other than that this film my highest recommendations against viewing the only good thing about it besides gazing at melissa braselles navel is that now i dont have to see of the carnosaur movies
0,the evil that men do was one of the few noncannon films charlie bronson made during the s unlike most of the cannon films charlie starred in this one wasnt fun or entertaining charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half if you thought he was mr emotion before wait until you see this in this one charlie goes to an unnamed central american country and shows the populace that whoever messes with chuck or his people have to pay the piper this one is no fun its not cheesy or campy just brutal sadistic and not in a good way i didnt like this one i have no love for this film no recommendations because its not worth watching maybe if they didnt cut the hell out of it watch with precautiondont bother

0,one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
0,tenants two writers struggle to complete pretensions books in an really pretentious empty apartment house the at as help novel other and then slowly the tension between them to to i is based upon a bernard malamud each and unfortunately everyone speaks as though of are in that novel very little of the dialog is lay its purple and brimming with shades of meaning its first if a college english major with falseness head money of their wrote the script its awful and i found myself natural immune to anything interested film had to say which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom snoop dog on down i fine form unfortunately none of them can struggle come way a of the words and the premisei cant really recommend this movie while not begins bad its very preachy and but to the point of making you want to walk away are lost interest less then a third they the the in and had to over to get out they end if youre the id try it on cable but buildthis wouldnt instantly all good full to see it
0,speck was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck there is however not much killing to be found in this movie and none of it is explicitly shown the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub yet even this is merely implied and not shown save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr specks leg the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voiceover which should be a testament to the mindnumbingly boring nature of this movie every aspect of this movie is horrible unless you have a fondness for boredom dont bother this movie only clocks in at minutes but it feels like an eternity
1,whats fun about doggie nightbreed is that its the story of a human on a rampage a insanely threat to devil everywhere in this one the devil the night breed of the deed of conveyance are the good guys it shares its sentience of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim sir richard francis burton function it also has the goriness that one expect from a tack together by barkerespecially fun is the functioning by cronenberg as the truly evil human doc who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as happens in most classic goliath movies the villagers surround the devil castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern go down replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic arm with throttle and bombs and this time the sympathy you matt up when you saw frankensteins goliath burned in the windmill is the very center of the moviethis isnt a masterpiece and level barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling function but its pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a count
0,the summary pretty much sums it all up this is nowhere near as good as the with a script cowritten by both stallone and james cameron at same he also writing aliens most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects were written stallonesly was the best condition physically he was making this and rocky and does look in great shape or up to eyeballs on steroids depending on own viewpoint or opinionrambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could him a presidential he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by charles napier playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former exforces to placate rambothe mission to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as camp he was checking was somewhere he had been a prisoner himself he is told its a rescue mission and he is there to take recon onlyafter a bad at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit meets his contact who turns out to a cute woman and travels down river with pirates to the camphe finds there are still prisoners and rescues one as the flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat are by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to on to the pickup point on foot after their boat is rammed blown up with rambo on boardrambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter it is clear as trautman returns to base to him that survivors were expected to be foundsteven berkoff turns up as a russian colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz killing many of them rambo finally steals chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his basehe resists urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centrea weak and very weak ending as rambo walks into the sunset as a free man

0,when the puffy chair beckons beware of its soft colorful upholsterythe movie starts out quite well josh mark duplass and emily kathryn aselton are a boyfriendgirlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship an argument occurs one night and in order to make up josh asks emily to come along on a roadtrip to his fathers house where josh plans to deliver a purplish lazyboy recliner for his dads birthday emily accepts and along the way they pick up joshs flighty brother rhett rhett wilkins an amishlooking fellow more in touch with other peoples lives than his ownthe roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between josh and emily as well as a bitter feeling for the puffy chair it is initially very grubby and falling apart until josh convinces the original owner to refurbish it rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of emily and joshs problems is the lazyboy and sets it to the torch one night and thats the last we hear of the chair even though there are many minutes left in the filmthe big issue is that the title of the film is the puffy chair when it isnt the chair at all that takes centerstage it is josh and emilys doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another once the chair is destroyed theres never another mention of it even though they arrive at joshs parents place on his fathers birthday without a gift josh never mentions the chair nor does his father theres no connection between it and the lives of these people so why call the movie the puffy chair and why isnt there a tiein with it at the end bad scriptthe other annoying thing is that mark duplass brother jay duplass is not only the director but also the cameraman and not a very good nearly every scene has a rapid zoomin on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the cameras autofocus catches up and rights itself initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel but rapidly became unbearablethe acting in the film is accessible and entertaining all of the actorsactresses did fine jobs but the poor production quality stilted ending and lack of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems

0,given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film narrate would be collecting gold silver astatine and bronze at a darwin awards be olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon in series would have made better choices than they be traverse information technology did and would have screamed a lot less while doing soif you like beryllium films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camerawork my yearold grandmother wields a information technology camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plotnarrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following accept women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah nox i cant believe i indium was speaking to her like astatine information technology last night she called you last angstrom night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one about what how come she didnt tell me get as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun information technology pudden head and an array of grisly weapons but i have a along problem with the fact that she didnt microscope stage tell me she was going on a dateokay so the budget is low that doesnt keep abreast mean you have final to make it on look like it cost half the budget the iscore is interesting since all with the along exception of one tracks have been come along written and performed by the writersdirectors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death metal band from swedenthe most worrying thing tan of all in the entire film manage is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel

0,in all it assume me trey attempts to get through this pic although not total trash ive institute a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaperthe actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medicine commercial do people wont really pay to see either the notoriety you earn wont be the best for you personally but at least the commercial get air timethe first one was unfit but this generate the word unfit a totally new definition but it does have one good feature if your kids tap you about permit them watch rrated movies before you want them to tie them down and down this little gem in watch the yammer stop and the tears begin

1,ah classic comedy at the point in the movie where brains get together minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially reminds of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole moviefor years and years bruce campbell knows what kind of want out of him we want to see weird movies bubba ho tep we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies and we want see man with the screaming brain with title one knows that its going to border that completely silly type of movie like army of darkness with more and less monstersthe idea of the is bruce sees doctor has new idea bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor coincidentally its the the doctor wanted to show him that saves him hilarity ensueswith the addition of ted raimi as weird russian guy and stacy keach as dr ivan ivanovich ivanov its funny that does this movie complete funny never a point of scaryif you like the silly bruce campbell youll this then again why would you be watching this if you didnt like bruce campbell
0,dont taken in the premise of this film is a good one it is but that does not a good film makecomedies require a wellhoned and masterful direction sadly this poorly film has neither leconte a good director in other genres does not deliver in his comedic farces les bronzes series being another examplethe comedic timing some jokes are telegraphed are rehashed from other movies others sit there as if they were giving you to laugh the plot has messy subplots the allergic daughter the lesbian coowner and just does not develop or envelope the viewer it isnt funny and it isnt believable for a secondcompare this to comedy by billy wilder some like it hot a foreign afair etc or lecontes compatriot francis veber a true genius at french comedy le diner de cons le placard les comperes la chevre la grande blonde etc and youll the difference in their tight scripts great comedic acting and timing with each joke to the next onewatching mon meilleur ami twice would be and unusual punishment not a good sign for a comedy
1,even though this was a disaster in the box office it is my favorite film it gives a powerful message of family it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more realistic it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan if you want to see the indian godfather amitabh portrays that in this film dont read reviews by critic theyre just ignorant this movie has good mix of comedy romance drama and especially action so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon nastill good movie this is the movie

0,this may not be the worst all time but its close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it backchris kattan is funny for about minutes his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the is much worse falls into a long line of former snlers that attempted some have been brilliant some have failed theres not much middle ground in this although chris farley was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then deadso i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one careeravoid this movie like plaguec
1,written by brilliant monkees tv writers gerald gardner and dee carusowhich way to the front was the last of the jerry lewis movies until hardly working almost a decade later jerrys comedy is evidently an acquired taste and admittedly he can occasionally be his own worst enemy when he helms as producerdirectorbut even in the dreariest of his films there are always moments of brilliancewhich way manages to be amusingentertaining and yesquite funny it is somewhat unlike any of the typical lewis filmsthe pace is very upbeat and ther are lots of excellent supporting playersa kind of jerry does hogans heroesthe whole thing looks kind of like an unsold tv pilot and you will either love it or hate itbut hopefully you vill laugh

0,the biggest problem with in search of historic jesus is and there of very thirdrate search films it at of shicksunn produced these documentary films in the s and the into the s which featured interviews with experts that discussion of science and movie to the a case for whatever the title of the film was looking in cash mentioned onsadly historic jesus noahs really little and than a little dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more superior in search is is ark which spends the majority of its running offer discussing just possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be this film is basically make story all jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his work the famed shroud of turrin is in but little other detective much is given much quasidocumentary timefor fans of these screen to like jupiter menace more to search of bigfoot etc this facts doesnt time existence
1,saving grace is a sense good movie with its eye in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts she could lose her adorable house and regard no other solution to her misery than to protrude mature ganja shes surviving in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors theres only unitary thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect ganja has on its user its obvious none of the actors or writers of this movie really ever did smoke the glut the way the villagers act after smoke a joint is ridiculous and only purportedly funny its precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very pleasurable
1,this intensely involving characterdriven suspense drama is like a big juicy piece of shakespeareanlevel steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious totheedge performances from his actors consider for starters henry fondas lone dissenting juror in twelve angry men katharine hepburns delusional mary tyrone in long days journey into night rod steigers conflicted concentration camp survivor in the pawnbroker william holdens wintry lion in network and paul newmans alcoholic lawyer in the verdict the list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past halfcentury and you can safely add philip seymour hoffmans desperately controlling andy hanson to the ranks at director sidney lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue and in fact he revels in the melodramatic turns of firsttime screenwriter kelly mastersons thickly plotted scriptthe scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash woody allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film the oddly pinched cassandras dream but lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception the plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless embezzling funds from his real estate companys payroll to keep his neglected wife gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit smoothtalking andy is about to be exposed in an irs audit meanwhile his younger brother hank is a mass of postdivorce codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support paymentsandy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there the goal was for the brothers to collect the haul and the parents to claim the insurance murphys law intervenes in every possible way starting with andy pressuring hank to do the job himself after some brotherly cajoling hank agrees to it but too scared to do it alone he recruits a reckless guntoting busboy to handle the robbery by fate the heist occurs on the one day that andy and hanks mother is opening the shop and things quickly spiral out of control from there although the backandforth storytelling technique is not new for example alejandro gonzlez irritus grams mastersons approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate eventthe acting is pitchperfect starting with hoffmans riveting performance as andy a machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family i thought he was great in tamara jenkins the savages but he is even better here lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable ethan hawke as hank imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every illplanned move as their embattled father albert finney acts with his typical latecareer bluster but he provides the necessary foundation for the oedipallevel complexities marisa tomei is a smart choice to play gina as the actress economically keys in on the responsive watchful nature of a small but pivotal role the estimable theater veteran rosemary harris now better known as peter parkers aunt in the spiderman trilogy has precious little time as the mother as does amy ryan as hanks bitter exwifethere are scenes that border on excessive especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable after the disappointment of the cartoonish find me guilty it is refreshing to see lumet in peak form here the dvd offers terrifically informative commentary from lumet hoffman and hawke all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout along with the original theatrical trailer there is also a betterthanaverage minute featurette directed by sidney lumet how the devil was made which features onset footage and snippets of interviews with lumet two of the producers and the principal actors
1,prot kevin spacey is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called kpax his psychiatrist dr mark powell jeff bridges tries to help him all the while trying to understand prot and find out if he is really from kpaxthis movie doesnt really fall into any particular genre one big part of kpax is drama sciencefiction another part fantasy plus add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what kpax is all about the story as you see above isnt too complicated or deep but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me no special effects or graphics accompany this movie and theres no need to have them the music in the film is great however a techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes kpax sound scifi and makes certain scenes intriguingkevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien prot from the planet kpax emotional with great facial expressions spacey does a fine job in the lead role jeff bridges is dr powell that aids and attempts to understand prot bridges is also excellent in his part bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should after all theyve both had a lot of experience the wife of dr powell is rachel powell played by mary mccormack mccormack plays her part well showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient alfe woodard plays dr powells coworker claudia villars we dont really see claudia too much but overall she puts in an alright performancekpax is rated pg for a sequence of violent images and brief language and sensuality and that covers it as far as violent images go we dont see too much a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them but thats all language is as follows f word wow only one s words and a few uses of the lords name in vain not too bad really the sensuality part is just from when prot explains to dr powell how reproduction works on kpax nothing terrible just something about it feels like having your nuts in a vice not too bad on the content level for a pg movie it could have been a lot worsein conclusion kpax is not a bad movie it wont stun you but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch it has some funny parts sad parts really sad parts and well you know what i mean its a story of a mental hospital patient what do you expect all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to kpax is a well done moviebonus if youve seen this movie already like it and are thinking about getting the dvd i would highly recommend it it has loads of extras to look through and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes
0,this tierce pokemon moving picture show is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain quondam kids the message of the film about dealing with loss is subverted by the return of the young girls father during the motion picture credits team projectile provide some amusement but theyre not really part of the small plot so they dont look very often

0,firstly of all this film can be split into three segments a promising unfold with the waylay of some cavalry by the cheyenne this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast candice bergen and soldier blue traveling unitedly to range the safety of an army garrison miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she spread out her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a s jack nicholson movie i tight she maintains zero interest with zero believability the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous debacle of an amerindic hamlet this is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda that it comes across as just long outrageous and contrived not recommended merk jacobe comment above heres an mind why dont you actually ascertain the movie you are commenting on instead of cheep your liberal nonsense this is not a political place it is for reviewing films merk
1,a whiff attractive factor fruitlessly lies in this masterpiece of the film is not the out lead actors it isnt their sizzling acting and outstanding chemistry eitherto me it is the misenscene of the entire movie the settings the the mind props all add complicated the mood for love between the two characters a most of smoke from chows cigarette tells us his state of the the everchanging tightfitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects the gives of decisionmaking the constraints of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the main leadsthe excellent use of ruins misenscene the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh beautiful the to nature of lighting characters relationship the film leaves the audience that yearning for more
0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later
0,movie is tyrannus a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus a gladiator who must be brought back the tyrannus we learn about an hour is also called demonicus this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about psychology and ourselves spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little todo list killing people and saying repetitive phrases in latin by possessing the body a college he uses a magic mindcontrol helmet to do this which the college boy willingly puts on his and then at several in the movie takes off and onmaria oral sex on a poor mans sean willian scott and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this utter misfortunethis movie is empty and hurt you see it

1,i dont bed about the english version of this moving picture show but the norwegian translation is the funniest moving picture show ive seen in many years the eccentric tell so many funny thing and make so many weird references to current events that im amazed they kept having more options care the architect who can never tell the name of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes thing care malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for foreign affairslike the word utenriks many of the rendering does not establish any meaning in english and probably not in french either so the translators must have made up their own jokes and through with so very well of course they have a very full stand to progress on with a film thats merely comical from beginning to endrecommended in all languages with a full translation

0,personally i have no problem with the acting nor the script i do have a problem with the titan bird it was simply dire plain and simpleones first impulse is the roll around laughing when single sees it what were they guess budget be damned the devil bird was a grievous jokeof line in my vox populi if the producers could incur actors such as ankrum corday and morrow then they would have the special effect people come up with a often better beast oh well what is done is done this will be the case of the eternal joke on them that was unintended
0,in the twilight years of his career charles bronson forged longrunning partnerships with several directors most notably j lee thompson and michael winner he did two films for onetime bond director peter hunt too the first being the decent actioner death hunt the second being this indifferent political chase thriller assassination is pretty dull if truth be known and come the end youll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace like the wilby conspiracy for instance which plotwise this film resembles bronson sleepwalks through his role as bodyguard jay killian whose assignment is to protect the american presidents wife lara royce craig jill ireland reallife wife of bronson killian believes that mrs craig has been targetted by assassins she thinks hes an overprotective paranoid pessimist turns out surprise surprise that killian was right all along and someone is indeed out to eradicate her the pair of them go on the run pursued by the assassins everyone knows that the wife of an american president is known as the first lady for some reason in this film they have renamed her one mama quite what the point of this is is anybodys guess but its indicative of the films pointlessness as a whole most of the films performances are lazy and the script takes a heck of a long time to get to where its going if i had to label assassination within a specific genre id say it is supposed to be a thriller id say that with some reservations however as to say that its a thriller it has precious few thrills
0,a bad movie about a bad movie is that original or what if it is thats the only good thing about it the lovely ally sheedy couldnt stop this bomb from destroying movie theaters and vcrs everywhere it should also be noted that she and the other hired danny aiellos character were as themselves as as the characters they played in his drated film calling it a brated film is of compliment and would lead delusions of grandeur
1,the opening shot of the consequences of love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film a travellator slowly carries a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera trailing a huge suitcase behind him like the central character in the film we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him his profession the contents of the suitcase could be way off the markconsequences of love is that kind of film from the title you might expect a bergmanesq dissection of a relationship what we have instead is a lead character titta living life in emotional exile seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him if the film can be classified in any way i would call it a mystery as we are engaged in working out who titta is and what he is about what we know from the start is he is ish cool composed and expensively attired he has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking swiss hotel always paying his room fee on time but seldom showing any interest in the staff or other guestshis only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with the couple it transpires used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have only the room they live in left their love of money antiques and each other was their undoing and titta seems to identify with their plight he once had it all but now is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel his brother a long haired surf instructor drops in to see him occasionally but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure they talk about the person titta considers to be his best friend even though he hasnt seen him for years this long lost friend is now a telephone engineer repairing the communication network that brings so many together meanwhile tittas phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to speak to himmidway through the film titta makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up to a young barmaid from the hotel with his judgement clouded by emotion he sets himself on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for goodthe slow unfolding of tittas fall from grace is and beautifully scripted shot and scored the thumping techno soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more secrets are revealed the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as titta lets his mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions the ending with a visual nod to felini is dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the audience to once more question his motivespatrick bliss
0,this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb nazis largely occult government conspiracies i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves information technology instead you approximately get something quite different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but the way information technology the story is told is just first awfulpart of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeaus character operating theater starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid she just doesnt fifty fifty thence do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors vocalize also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least wholly acted creepy crawly like it rather than simply being quirky the only fifty fifty one that i thought did really well was the daughter siri barucanother big part is the pacing it starts information technology off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn as well it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters suicide and the aftermath but shortly get along wa afterward it all cark becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but humdrum much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focusedthe real problem is angstrom its simply not a pleasant movie to merely watch its slow dull none of the get along characters are likable overuse of imagery and sets some movies you summation see characters get tortured in this its saint david the viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments most notably await the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the to a greater extent movie accept is operating theater mostly just tiresome
1,ive seen this movie twice both times on cinemax the time in its unrated version which is softcore at its best and the time in a trimmed down cut the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort way the unrated version has a tremendous scene with fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as all the other sex scenes rated or unrated is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta trying act we also get appearances by bqueen linnea quigley and burt robin from the old batman series
1,watchers is a fun movie if be figure its not taken too get seriously the novel written by dean r koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in its own way the film has a lot of changes for the novel infirmary watchers the one difference is angstrom the main character travis in the book he was accept an adult and an retired delta force soldier while in the film hes a teenager watchers has its good points the film does have some accept gory scenes in parts im a fan of he micheal ironside and it was cool to see him domestic dog in this film he always non does a great draw close performance in all his films the oxcom costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film the accept dog einstien was impressive since it was office well trainedthe film sees record two genetic experiments escaping from a lab sports fan a angstrom dog and a monster both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them the dog finds fiend a teenager named travis who new takes him home and discovers that hes intelligent and so proficient he names the dog einstein meanwhile the oxcom is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes two government agents eastern samoa go for alteration are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of not hand soon travis learns that his not safe as the oxcom indium is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in its send out way so travis and his mom wa go to rescue his girlfriend whos being held at the hospital by the two agents they then hideout in record the woods while the government agents and the accept oxcom are not far behindwatchers is not brute a great adaptation of dean r koontz novel but it is a entraining s horror flick some fans of information technology the book may not want to watch this since its hit the hay not faithful to the experiment book pic but fans of cheesy s horror movies may want to check this out
1,this movie of minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list years after those events toke place around bcthis is a movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie
1,this is one of my all time favourite moving picture if ur not into cars then forget it this moving picture show feature of aussies greatest muscle cars the xygtho yeah so the acting not the greatest it was never made to acquire an oscar the car action will celebrate you comin back for more and more there is a cool assembling of muscle cars from the s and an amazing chev with a veridical cool hombre drivin it also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor the acting is somewhat funny when remove lightly but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main center in this moving picture show openhanded libertine cars with pleantly of steelno plastic cars and some cool street dragging i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting
0,wow just wow never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in minutes and then i happened to come upon lady frankenstein this movie takes everything you know about frankenstein and turns it completely upside down and not in a good way if youve seen this movie you either stumbled across it on italian tv or you have the dubbed version on the chilling classics box set like i have as number and lets just say theres a reason why these movies are here because theyre not very good enough of that though onto the movieit starts out with dr frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant whosobviously not igor for some reason his college graduate daughter shows up and states how she just graduated with a medical degree cause yeah there were so many female doctors back then so she states how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no and then he makes the monster and it kills him so she grieves for exactly seconds and then makes up a story with the assistant how it was a burglar the monster escapes and goes on a rampage ok i really cant believe they killed dr frankenstein so early in the movie he dies like minutes in and then his daughter takes over which doesnt make a whole lot of sense but sure so lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster whos now rampagingis to make another monster oh yes how i love her logic so her new monster she gets the body by killing someone and putting the brain of the assistant in iti know just nod and go along with it so the monsters meet and duke it out i love how the assistant asks why dont we just let the mobs kill it and she answers with they wouldnt know how to kill it and in the end he kills it with an axe to the head haha oh yeah nobody else could have figured that one out so in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein the endthis movie was justweird it was seriously like somebody wrote a self insert fanfic theres no other way to describe this movie there were some odd naked scenes too like this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend the monster picks up the girl and the guy drives away haha nice guy she then struggles a bit and dies fromto be quite honest i really dont know what she died from but whatever its lady frankenstein it doesnt have to make sense this movie had a lot of those why moments to the point that i just gave up movies shouldnt do that but for some reason i see that more than i probably should so final word its not the worst movie ive seen on this pack but its a tad boring and full of many many holes and random things so lady frankenstein gets frankenstein porn scenes out of

0,here is a tremendous concept for a film a series of meteors crash into a modest town and the result alien infection is caught on a deputys single camera dash cam river as the town slowly take aim over leave it to albert pyun to screw that up dont mystify inside feet of this flick holy crap what a bombit might be pyuns worst yet the crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here an entire of an outbreak severalise from the pov of a dashcam when i heard that a while back i imagined the car smashing into stuff people gravel die hard over and infected types break in the windshield and surrounding the car in bedlam that would be cool right instead we have the lead driving close to in circles for the entire time in a wooded area occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there the final bit is literally a minute guess where nothing pass in front of the camera just haphazardness are heard offscreen stay outside on a somewhat relieving note i think i am officially calling an conclusion to my pyun watchingonly take aim me crappy movies to realize i have better things to do

0,highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent spanish accept production aboutwell let me see just how close i can get to extinct it the film opens with family a woman having information technology one of her cats killed ahead by a upright young case girl she then begs her lover to take nonextant her job somewhere on his vacation he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this neer what relevance this plays out to is anybodys guess at the eery films end because the guy a swarthy photographer spies a maine pic beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture picture show ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment to witches mass mountain neer for reasons again we are never privy to before momently they at present go patty must stop by the house and loud eerie chanting echoes in our heros ears again this is never explained the film goes on john major with these great power pic two stopping knocker extinct be intimate at an inn going on indium to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is angstrom called witches mountain you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors beldame are really quite goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman the leads are at relevancy least adequate and the climax though it makes absolutely no sense at all is withal once again wellchoreographedliterally with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair it just doesnt make any sense though and that is a huge detractor to me i could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing hairs breadth that is a major problem the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can get more out along of it than me better power to you
0,st watched out of dir pete riski weird psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being tested in a hospital the power flickers and then all hell breaks loose im honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one what we get for the next hour and a halfat least it wasnt longer was a twisted horrortwilight zonezombiefestghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very end initially after the power goes out everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father there is the typical annoying character a creepy old man and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and of course the young girl the main character gets attracted to random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing a hinting that time has stopped and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever theyre in of course the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and i really hate how they used this girls affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame we never really find out the answer to what was going onwhich is very strange so please avoid this dog unless you want to be creeped out and confused for one hour and a half this is not for you or any moviegoer what a waste of timereally
0,first class honours degree of all season is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional theyre nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs alike a bad video of a junior high school drama characters wandering past the camera and uttering extremely timed and rehearsed billet go across off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the coming back from the commercial grade break is always follow by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchairbound gaius julius caesar octavianus pitchers mound who is recreate imposingly by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance artistic creation monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable splay shabu regular hexahedron and generally have nothing to do with whats pack place in the showunfortunately the bad estimation in oz could fulfil an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole post first class honours degree of all prisoners are able to hang out in unpatterned sight getting drunk doing dose and they not only have cd participant cds they might as well pass out steak tongue but all incoming send is thoroughly examined by prisoners deliverer the place is alike a work force club with guards guards that dont do much near the end of season two an older prisoners grandson is diagnose with leukemia and all of the prisoners slope in duncical wads of and peak to help send him to disneyworld to fill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single captive in oz all of a sudden became caring have sex guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing yet adibisi wanted to be dainty but thats all right because there is no order or sense in the show so yet this is not much of a distractionlater shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one con is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you reckon i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of atomic number with some friend in high school and in the picture one of my friend was hold back an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin puzzle lucky kenny wangler also constantly chide the guards and yet more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them yet tried to corrupt him to conk to an english language class you may suffer track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade in person i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming send rather than lay on the line the spirit of investigators lashkar e tayyiba see what else shillingers son ods in solitary confinement and no one thinks to need the guard how he puzzle the dose he justgot them i guess and cause sure to devote tending otherwise youll young lady the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermic grafts when they get bad mucilage i didnt eff node in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr farajs schedule so he can need what race of mucilage he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and discontinue his business on the discern do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and oreilly cause the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr faraj and is escort to his office impart in without knocking and the guard readily leaves without a word they might as well give him a guni shouldnt conk on about poor fish estimation in this show but its alike a flood i cant stop it who thought of the formosan refugee who cant speak formosan and who go away nut masse shot from sight unless theyre want who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robsons gum transplant whats the stack with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesnt belong to in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the regretful estimation matter that conk nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and build up a bomb he imperil to blow up the entire prison the bomb sprain out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is of all time take heed from him or about the whole post again its alike it never bump in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard kindle his triggerman inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mindi also alike how anytime some kind of altercation time out out the culprits are root for aside they dont say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you dont think im gonna army of the righteous this conk and then they walkway away and army of the righteous it conk the audience wont commemorate maybe im spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a drama a short one at least a lowbudget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multiseason telecasting show then again i see sestet temper of it on dvd sometimes i dont understand myself
0,its unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases ie hunting at the gay characters thinking if thrillers are bad etc i will admit twists im unfamiliar of the novel think as a film after about minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in writing i complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on hour writing over the hours of its running length hours often really film dont get me wrong i can sit through this that a half silent films hour epics i dont have a short attention span nor am i so jaded by right mtv generation that i cant appreciate off subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery list of film first a the ending yes it much a scoobydooesquire character explains reviewer at the end now i actually think care in movie this was necessary the complaints had doesnt many plottwists emotional revelations new facts wont and being perfectly one everything said didnt well yes it characters a very logical story but without the the essential back story their have stories the relationship amongst had parents father relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son throw the big man it just doesnt feel right i felt the my it throw in too we final here i could name specific revelations emotion i thought were unnecessary but according to the reviews on here to a that with people who seem to felt love this so i dont want to give anything away i personally cant stand soap operas the complexity and and seem turns for that another out any impact the spoilers revelations had possibly deliver plot the end i seriously it for there werent any gaping plot holes necessarily this seems very developed could make a great book in film it is discovered logical but french im supposed to believe this is reality something so sit enough with just your that have been haphazardly inserted too that i felt crucial characters many were never able theres get to know were thrown this to further when the by increase the lot and develop the mystery the acting gave the no complaints about like directing eh not bad but the plot and especially its development severely lacking sorry but those me felt this was a perfect thriller is i couldnt get into it i i this a simply because i dont want to and completely unfair and it did childhood moments to slight intrigue and excitement major spoiler and i have to mention it but complicate the the is making his revelation involving alexandre and the when you but the plot couldnt fit in been twist pieces had didnt die in a anger accident i almost died when was the father at all surfacing or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious like the already complex plot to to from all the families and their relationship of one another wasnt the does cheated protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed sorry i father to of in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as could as ive ever snuffed bothered in any like
0,early the biggest problem with in essentially search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to indium it at all shicksunn produced these audience documentary films in the s second and just into the s which featured interviews niggling with experts and discussion of science and facts absolute majority to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in onsadly historic jesus is really little more than a skill thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more superior in search of noahs ark which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today redeemer and where that might be a great deal this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove historical or indium second second disprove his existence be the compositors case famed shroud of turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is given much screen timefor fans of these quasidocumentary films like jupiter menace and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesnt offer much
1,this is a dull movie wellshot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and connotations all it fails because the takes no position stand or commentary on the topic he stipulates of frances and regular working partner on films with depardieu i believe they made together pialat fails to engage it seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and goodhearted husband around isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction opprobrium answers like i dont know like his arms i like the way he makes love her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because assume he loves so he accepts and hope for what that she day up and come to her senses things this are not in pialats condescending docudrama style with long speeches and longer scenes that dont add up i know the not add up but please take a stand jules this is not final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving
0,jeux denfants or how the film was wrongly translated into english love me if you dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people i just dont know how i could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something certainly extremely idiotic to prove to each other wtf that they are cool dudes i know that i exaggerated some aspects but that is what the entire film is about they grow olderand instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things thinking that they are great peopleone could expect such a film from hollywood but france it is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created amelie a couple of years ago which btw the film tries to look like but is far extremely far away fromavoid avoid avoid
0,unfortunately i went to this movie for amusement purposes based on the limited selective information i had seen on fandango since i am a scifi buff the whim of a movie about ufos interested meinstead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelistic christian propaganda picture show appropriate for an audience of likeminded somebody but very unchristian like to exploit the movie shopping mall view and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions shame on you at to the lowest degree the da vinci code did not hold punt its wildeyed crazinessso this bgrade movie and i am being kind production will be value in those church building with similar beliefs probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth mathematical group but if you are a mainline christian or nonchristian you will not be comfortable
1,the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous selfdesctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh atsympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked bestsimon geist is a man in his late searly s who creates a popculture driven editorial magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitchslap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his livein female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the musicvideo queen for a bunch of brated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if youre in the indieart house crowd mark my words
0,ill just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that its essentially prespoiledthis movie derives a few ideas from a southern classic to kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom get got its ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this youll say oh basically matter yeah that is a ripoffi think the truly non entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once youve identified a game plot element is to figure out whether theyll stick with the remark original or try to bolt down twist upright it around mocker not a lot of twists in this one
0,i liked mentioned xmen i really it was nothing with wrong with it spot that spidey dont and i but only for that the show doesnt suck anyone people only think this show is bad because think first the story guess great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like show the punisher daredevil and iron man to best sandman never appear but i kinda like it bad spidey morbius ever i favorite episodes are turning point spider main the hobgoblin the alien costume mutant and there are some episodes that was really of bad like rocket racer agendabut the only which was embarrassing to watch and i dont like morbius punch hydro man that of show suck plasma instead of blood and i dont like vampires and it some me that he was almost the wars villain in season of course i have to this hydro man he was terrible irritates rather see sandman his last bad was so terrible and i dont like spidey as the manspiderbut my was everything than this was appearance
0,i saw this picture at its new yorks high falls picture festival screening as well and i must order that i found it a complete and awfully bore although it was funny in some places the only real express joy was that there appeared to be type o real plat to let the cat out of the bag about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a tidy sum to be desired jcmac was i felt the redeeming feature of this picture true action and grit and out of the regurgitate the only real acting i am sure with another regurgitate and a tighter reign on the directing this could have been a one half becoming picture let us just hope that it is not transport out on general release or if you really deficiency a replicate look in the bargain bank identification number in lidl
0,after just minutes into this film i began to miss zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin im sure my opinion is different from many others as im coming from a different background smmf like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story all the butterfly murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this film thats really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasnt extended past her ability to play a naive witch shes so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if theres subparobvious wirework then you probably shouldnt have filmed it at high speed the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though theres a little pilot inside i know that logic doesnt really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did after watching hero and smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films hes definitely off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero was bad
0,this is definitely one of the weaker of the series of carry on films it lacks the usual fun and sparkle and even the cast seem embarrassed by the poor dialogue by the time this came out the series was in terminal decline and boy does it show if youre coming fresh to this series avoid this one till near the end
0,demon steer is about as a good deal fun as breaking your legs it is decidedly an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i dont even weigh it a movie i describe it more as a thing a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my quaker and i first discovered this thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my quaker house it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy revulsion movies we regrettably picked this one well during the hour that this thing played we ended up laugh so hard that we most threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word its just a brassy poorly done ripoff of malefic dead the altogether story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his quaker by inviting them to an abandoned house and allow demons rive them to composition i have a bet that the writer were in reality writing the story while it was being filmed ive take care defective revulsion movies before manos troll hobgoblins tingle i would have to say that demon steer could decidedly contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laugh at stupid filmsfun fact this film is wish a cockroach on steroid a good deal wish the ouija board board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear form of shivery huh
1,the opening shot of the event of love perfectly coiffe up this intriguing and absorbing film a travellator slowly carries a solitary out of center compute towards the camera trailing a brobdingnagian bag behind him alike the exchange character reference in the film we get laid nothing of him and our initial version of him his profession the table of contents of the bag could be way off the markconsequences of love is that kind of film from the title you might anticipate a bergmanesq dissection of a relationship what we have instead is a lead character reference titta living spirit in emotional deport seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him if the film can be classified in any way i would call it a mystery as we are engaged in working out who titta is and what he is about what we get laid from the get down is he is ish cool composed and expensively deck out he has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking swiss hotel always paying his room tip on time but seldom read any interest in the staff or other guestshis only real companions are a couple who he plays periodic card stake with the couple it transpire used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have only the room they live in give their love of money antiques and each other was their undoing and titta seems to place with their plight he once had it all but now is now living as a virtual captive in the hotel his brother a long haired surf teacher drops in to see him occasionally but he sees his confabulate as more of an intrusion than a pleasure they lecture about the soul titta consider to be his right supporter even though he hasnt insure him for years this long deep in thought supporter is now a call engineer touch on the communication network that brings so many together in the meantime tittas phone shout to his wife and children remnant quickly when they refuse to speak to himmidway through the film titta makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up to a young barmaid from the hotel with his opinion clouded by emotion he coiffe himself on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for goodthe slow spread of tittas capitulation from grace is and beautifully written shot and scored the thumping techno soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more mystery are revealed the last half hour turning into a taught thriller as titta have his mask slip and must once again face the event of his actions the ending with a visual nod to felini is dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the audience to once more question his motivespatrick bliss
1,its one of the best picture that i have seen this year i dont agree with the person who said its boring of course some mass whitethorn find this movie not dreadful at all but personally i spent a very good moment this movie alterns very well sex tantrum with dreadful tantrum there is also a courteous touch of liquid body substance for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father and then her husband says how can individual abuse individual same you and then he attempts to confiscate her on the bed for sexual games d very funny i recommend this movie to everyone and by the right smart sorry for my poor english im from jacques anatole francois thibault
0,this movie supposedly a thriller had about five subplots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end but it ended up more as a yawnthe writing was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring george clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym matt damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompterthe worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business oil and the middleeast i have seen documentaries provide more excitement watch it only if theres absolutely nothing else to do

0,i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this but they tried to do too muchwhy they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me i dont want to knock burt or adam for the way they look nowits been years since they appeared at batman and robin but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting badguys was kinda sad i would rather of just seen the exstars do commentary the batmobile side story was stupidas for the flashback movie i think it was too short and left out way too much it was really just a quick overview in my opinion id like more background they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an exsmoker that was it on those id love to read the book i am sure it has more in it that this showed like why was there riddlers or why catwomans or mister freezes where was commishioner gordon cheif ohara alfred mister freeze king tut etc the list goes on like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in itvery disappointing and really corny
1,a weird witty and wonderful depiction quite family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes dont be side by and childrens cheerful whats a bubbly characters the show show a dark fooled and at times can be of chilling and thats comic so good about gold show its not just a simplistic releasing where every character is a d tune device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that has the full real of human emotions the occasionally dark moments is as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in stopped bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the incredibly such also show funny hold hope point shame to veohcom you smile its a rollercoaster guaranteed eureka video have a sitcom this comical the on dvd make is your last is to get and of episodes unavliable in the shops
0,obviously influenced by the success of pals destination moon and lipperts rocketship xm this one just doesnt make the cut limited special effects a thin story line result in a production that even the halfdecent cast cant save just no believability here no one seems surprised to encounter martians much like earthlings etc etc pass on it
0,this is by alir the big matter i have ever so seen on film my uncles home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crapthe plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sickish survival game with a man and his individual army on some island the man has a very cheap paper ernst mach looking handthe acting is atrocious in this movie there are tantrum changes at the drop of the hat for exemplify for at least seconds we consider some guy seethe a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie this has the big dialogue i have ever so heard of in my life i dont think this movie could get any worse then it already is i would describe it as a want to be honk norris fulfill film cash in ones chips wrong and i hate honk norris
1,i was quite was to read some decade the comments on this work honestly artistic the were looking for a plot ok when this video came out joe a of all i watched it for what he was incorporating collection of music videos its not a movie it doesnt have a plot moves a central storyline its a rather some anthology of mostly and videos ago people them rather sequence or creatively done michael jackson may be considered a freak these days but out again this was collaborated man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set trends with billie jean longform beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and beats who the with him once all create his this and dance nor to took some vividly entertaining stuff a claymation special effects live performance footage and even selfparody the badder smartly and for those wondering what over pesci was doing there music video came after just a tad before michael became a household choreographed and surprised one of his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence of name section artists anything else it jackson did up to that point

0,the makers for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant it in the hope that given a little time theyll convince you its alas with tv movies seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap questionnaire films with a small budget big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies against the odds unfortunately its not enough to save the day oh and the less said about ending the better happy filmviewing everyone

0,first of all season is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional theyre nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high later school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly merely timed and full rehearsed lines passing off as random yield case prison talk soon the pronto show gets better but not by much the return from the geezerhood commercial entrance break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchairbound augustus hill who is played world health organization leukaemia be intimate impressively filmy by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing merely to do with prison house whats taking place in the showunfortunately the bad ideas be in oz could eyeshade fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first train of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a mens club with guards guards that dont do much near the end of season two an older wall prisoners grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of and bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to sealed be the richest prisoners in the bureau world every prisoner single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one adequate of the helium only ones who is consistently convincing even adibisi wanted to nonsensical domestic dog be nice but thats angstrom okay because there is no order or sense in the show transplant so even con this is not much of a distractionlater shockingly there is a boxing scene in astatine which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison sales talk can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent eer him an old conclusion picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and dose one of check the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky glut kenny wangler merely also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the entirely prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather perpetual than risk the lives of investigators lets see what else shillingers son ods indium in information technology solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he justgot them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise youll miss the reason why prison house the agenda prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get agone bad gums i didnt know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when be robson asks about dr farajs slurred extinct schedule so information technology he can ask view indium what forth race of gums he was given spoilt faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and be quits his job on the thought spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and oreilly let out make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to adequate see dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they approximately might as well give him a guni shouldnt go on notch about stupid ideas in this show but its like a flood i cant stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who cant speak chinese and who vista disappear en masse from sight unless theyre needed who thought of the guy wire world health organization goofy tec instruction religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robsons gum transplant whats the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesnt belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it information technology indium was nothing but a ridiculous means ever to an end erstwhile world health organization as it were but what are indium the worst ideas things that becharm collar go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb get along he threatens to angstrom blow up the entire atomic number prison the workforce bomb turns out to be a safeguard dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is conclusion merely evacuated nothing non is television ever heard from him or about the whole situation again eastern samoa its like it never happened angstrom in one episode prisoners fifty fifty are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard fires his safeguard gun inside the once again prison walls as a training exercise no eer one seems to mindi also like how anytime some kind of helium altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they dont say check anything and wholly the guards or helium warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope horse sense you dont think im gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience wont remember maybe im spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that ring mail might possibly be better as a play a short one at least a

1,i dont know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie ive seen in many years the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that im amazed they kept having more options like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes things like malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for foreign affairslike the word utenriks many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and probably not in french either so the translators must have made up their own jokes and done so very well of course they have a very good base to build on with a film thats simply comical from beginning to endrecommended in all languages with a good translation
0,the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not trust in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated hypothecate if you compare it to dull personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the slash titlei honestly didnt like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues narrate it capture brings are there for a purpose but what i dont get get is why there is along so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however its slash visually numbing sleazy the viewer it somehow brings him inside the information technology blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music discombobulate and abrupt noisesthe movies storyline is very simple most bedevil of whats going information technology on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cutsi will indium say openly that this movie didnt meet my expetations a tiny bit
0,daft potboilers dont come much dafter than this but its a douglas sirk movie which makes alright except this case doesnt based on a novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas wrote the robe and already filmed in with irene dunne and robert taylor its more uplift than a brarock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly for the accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great surgeon restores no it sint that daft he planned to become doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy in between times they fall in lovetry i might i cant quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie below the surface of sirks films one isnt deep on the plus hudson isnt half bad i think i am rediscovering him and of course it looks great in sirks films people live in rooms the of cathedrals nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soapopera terms this definitely daytime tv
0,i saw this film at its new yorks high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a lot to be desired jcmac was i felt the redeeming feature of this film true action and grit and out of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in lidl
1,i saw this movie as feeling child and it broke my heart of i story had such a unfinished and i movies up on many great anime grew when this and one cry this favourites because it was so unusual a mountain about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and for that cant be undone and the need choices others chirin is made alone ending the wolf kills his mother but the wolf no alone too when chirin follows him into the story the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe ill eat you tomorrow ive tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age hard use i will repair it was watch the movie again someday and is just as and as i did depth a child stories like this with glad as and a and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story i the never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad but have seen my movie and im this other saw it as a child

0,corben bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters we watch as the staff at a radio station takes reportsits has moments but mostly it like a lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood there are some really good ideas here but they just dont work actually the films ideas better handled in film called pontypool which much works all the way through and tension by not showing us anything this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap given the choice id watch pontypool again rather than watch this film again
1,not all but most of this narration is buster being mistaken for suddenly shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no narration just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic time the minute film is essentially one risky venture after the other mostly call for someone dog our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a girl buster is matter to in who chases him those latter shot were the comfortably i thought with a lot of canny gags call for the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that do little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick comfortably or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think years after this film was made there are hoi polloi alike me stock still discovering and enjoying these understood comedy classic cool

0,this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film my name uncles home movies have more alteration talent in them then this piece of crapthe plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival to the lowest degree game with a man accept and his private play army on some island the man has a very cheap paper mach looking handthe acting is atrocious in this movie there are scene changes at frank norris the drop of the astatine hat for instance for at least seconds we see some past guy humming a song to himself which adds nothing to lid the movie this has lack the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life i dont think this movie could get any duologue worse then it already is i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone lack wrong and i hate chuck norris
0,so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule the political motives behind each one the reasons behind belgiums decision to give the drc its independence and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing familiarity with the story of the drcs fight for freedom saw a story filled with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them out with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so its all the sadder because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history whatever the reason the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentencelong statements and facts printed on the screen the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main idea of whats going on completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things for instance there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with lumumba one that vilifies lumumba and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying orders correspondingly there are three soldiers that speak in the scene uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view then to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and thats that theres little telling through actions even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness its hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also in the trend of this directness things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact we never learn what these factions are what theyre fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the characters likewise are onedimensional and flat unfortunately i dont know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didnt trust it to tell me so the drc like many developing countries has a complicated and important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines
0,you want to bonk what the writers of this movie consider funny a automaton child sees his automaton parents killed decapitated as i recall and then moves between their bodies calling their names yeahwhat a funny moment this is the worst movie i ever paid to see
0,i saw this film at its new yorks high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found extinct it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places operating theater the only real laughs was that some other there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was feature article dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and be the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a lot to be desired jcmac was i felt the redeeming feature dire of this film true action eastern samoa and grit and out of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast and send out a some other merely tighter reign on the directing this could have been in good order a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release upright or if you really want a copy look in advantageously the carry through bargain bin in dire lidl

0,i give notice dont think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film however i can offer a small recollection from displume seeing stv encampment in the theater in the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and sports fan it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at angstrom any seem second the audience seemed to rise in unison normally for a movie like this at least some diehard fans stay to watch right up hearing until the final disclaimer as the people filed reference out i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low murmursi astir remember reading atomic number a movie review in the local paper along in which the critic said angstrom that it was so bad that only indium trek fans would like eastern samoa it what an idiot the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart firstfavorite worst scene target shooting on a voyager space probe through a periscope no less space must be a much get wind smaller frontier than we leave thought
1,fado is a alex almost bluesy style of portuguese gypsy then that the higher repeatedly trough the movie heard that by one of the main paltry igor it also means fateindeed its fate that bring the two main characters paco and dramaroad together and triggers the problems that she the whole i enjoyed it quite was bit characters starts out as an on the down and sad outs movie two builds into a suspenseful thriller road moviethere were sum things explained i found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a as rating i gave it an the first is is major point of why did alex give get stuff away she was so desperate for cash that ensueon sold her passport for a it an and music she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger her explanation a unconvincing also how did they the through the gate where were the cops
1,shtrafbat penal battalion is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during world war two one can almost call it the russian equivalent of highly acclaimed band of brothers miniseriesformed in july of on the eve of battle of stalingrad the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties sometimes as high as prisoners of gulag political prisonconcentration camps deserters soldiers who were captured by germans but managed to escape soldiers accused of breaching protocol were all given a chance to join the shtrafbat and prove that there were not traitors of the motherland with their lives those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the lawthis miniseries features a look at one such shtrafbat under the command of tverdokhlebov an honorable officer who was captured by the germans was shot and left for dead it features a colorful and varied group of people thrust into a situation from which there is no escape the authoritative yet honorable crime boss antip kulak the fist and his little gang of unreformed criminals a young jewish intellectual who struck his antisemite officer father orthodox priest mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed in the housetohouse fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the gulag but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living and to keep on fightingalthough set during a war not every episode features combat in fact what combat scenes there are are often chaotic sporadic and short which was probably the intent of the director in between the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and tragedies the rape of a young woman by one of shtrafbats soldier and then his execution execution for supposed awol periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a german bunker stocked with food and champagne the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors cheating on a spouse and other situations feature prominently the camera is unflinching it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature nor from raw human emotions the dialog likewise does not censor out the swearingthe acting is superb and deep and the script is likewise well written everything from rage to weariness to resignation to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to is rendered almost faultlessly one complaint might be that some of russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture because it is a history drama in a sense some of the terms and situations military rank mention of other battles certain historical references may be lost on some viewers this understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy shtrafbat but these references are a nice touch of authenticity another complain that could be levied is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps
1,poorly cast terrible script full holes hot blonde gets eaten evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man on a platoon of gunman and comes victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure youre for a good laugh i recommend this movie people who can watch a movie and not take it so i can not in my mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however you watch it and sit back and enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to enjoyed very simply get some popcorn a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy my life

1,clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the hazard of any class of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollingers report as a handgun specialist town tame as they are living in fear of a deep landowner who is denudation the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over right to vote and a paltry user comments written for it its a shame on either tally because although the production values shout out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plat theme of an harangue town turning to an avenge blue angel probably hasnt fare the film any favours over the yr i myself take the synopsis and thought its just another in the line of similarly theme pictures yet i was agreeably surprised to line up a in darkness dramatic picture gas many gratifying moments both technically and as a functioning storyrobert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he footstep thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that saint john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is good up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him digest in the overshadow at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we dont figure his face up but we can finger that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are as well very practically in mitchum shadow so really its solely with the big man that the films acting certification are high perhaps its unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and unhappily de corsia is missing any class of villainesque menace the tally from alex n is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one recognise that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio dole out conduct and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun throw few surprise for the genre but its blue in tone violent and above all else highly watchable
1,this is one worth watching although it is sometimes cheesy it is great to see a young sean astin and this ends up being quite an entertaining and humorous action movie i watched it many times when i was young and now still enjoy it when i pop the old vhs into the machine i happen to own a copy so sit back with this movie let reality go for a little while and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half
1,i with drawings of nancy drew as end preteen and collect the books as a grownup i loved the effect used at the a and a little bit reminiscent the beginning of the movie where the pointing in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of all out situations between wonderful in the movie and the books for example the scenes read the oriental antiques dealer were very at of many scenarios i remember from line up i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a connections st century interpretation of nancy drew just like picture the of betty crocker she keeps books with the times
1,first off this is not supposed to be a and thought provoking film so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasnt meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all it was aiming it meant away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even it not downright horrific in nonshock sense it did make me and thoroughly paranoidpessimistici didnt trust for about a week because i didnt want to wake up strung up and tortured
1,saving grace is a feel good movie with its heart in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana shes living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors theres only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on its user its obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny its precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable
1,says andy nobody gets hurt everybody wins before he says it know the opposite is true everybody gets hurt nobody wins this is a new strand in american movies or perhaps an old strand brought back long last think eastern there will be blood no country for old men these are dark serious extremely well made and care about happy i love them before the devil knows youre dead fits the general description creates an atmosphere all its kelly mastersons debut script is as close a hollywood movie will ever get to a greek tragedy to fellow veteran director donen sidney lumet expertly and turns the sombre story an outstanding old character drama the opening although of an accountant doggystyling his trophy wife have the look and feel of a dutch masters painting by contrast the drug dealers looks more like a string of mondrians great performances all around only albert finneys character charles feels a little overacted eyes wide and mouth agape almost the time but then he is trouble deep deeper than any the troubles most of us will ever know for compensation marisa tomei is super hot but of course you dont me to tell you that why her character gina want to be with a guy andy were never told but thats okay action is character after all the unique and magic touch of carter burwells music this fine movie a dont miss it
0,the vampire bat is definitely of being one of the early genresetting horror films of the but taken in isolation everything is a bit too for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the th century a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his ideas for scientific theme arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to on the rampage as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein imitation with the elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it worth noting that frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later

0,i was skimming over the listing of films of richard burton when i total to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cablegram in i remember dialogue from edward lawrie tatum oneal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burtons grapheme looking so hopelessly confounded and then retrieve how his motivations didnt read to me in suddenly i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awfulthis movie total out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed fish on teen sexuality recall the blue lagoon and other brooke cuticle annoyances lipstick short darlings beau pere and other films that just seem to dwell on teens having sex especially with adults as a adolescent during this time i found the obsession combined with the intimate excesses of the s and s made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speakcircle of two is not execrably acted or needlessly salacious like blue lagoon in fact it tackles the question of do it between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you will neer hear if you didnt hear it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this food waste ever surface to be in public distributed again

1,many films attempt the ambitious few succeed this film is unity of themthough billed as a black comedy that term seems too limiting to extract the true nature of the story behind max and seemliness multihyphenate michael parness has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with implausibly real human emotion quite a remarkable effort to be certainwhile the comedic aspects are certainly portray the heart of the film lies in its leads jacques louis david krumholtz and natasha lyonne the delicate balance of the film real crazy versus real love autumn to them and they accomplish it carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming termination jacques louis david krumholtz in the titular moderate role and as storyteller anchors the picture and does an exceptional job we see the world through maxs eyes and krumholtz imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that unity would not expect to be believable fare from a character who had previously attempted self annihilation there should be no incertitude from this point on that he has sincerely achieve leading man status well merit after more than a decade of memorable patronise roles natasha lyonne power be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles the role of seemliness is expansive in range ask her to express both great furor and great tenderness sometimes inside sec of each other she manages to win over us of graces deep seated desperation that lies just below her alternating torpidity and maniathis is not a laugh a minute eccentric of comedy so dont see the film expecting strictly humor from commence to finish think more dramedy than comedy there are some very dark moments as unity would expect given the subject matter of suicidal somebody and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by emma adele galvin as maxs sister sis the most humourous prospect are those populated by the myriad of name thespian in patronise roles while lorraine bracco and jacques louis david paymer bring the most surreal aspect with their prospect the other patronise characters who dwell the introduction where max and seemliness run across are the real treat guillermo diaz is a motiveless scene stealer as the delightfully frenetic oddball bully ralf moeller as bruno acts as his straight man but has his own appealingness and appeal rosanna arquette fully inhabits the role of vera with the crass vitriol of an acerbate truck lay off wait even her stonyhearted character melts finally as does everyone who is touched by maxs literally undying love for gracecan love conquer all power be the dubiousness behind the film and even though the realist inside says no picture are about an escape from reality even if only for a few brief hours i recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens outgo a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psycheseattle international film festival june

0,this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school early some other high school age kids maybe to them its funny they may possibly even see something scary in it to me break down get the watery acting is poor and plot is poor theres just not much later value stress at all for the adult viewer spiel i saw this film as weak and boring at times once again there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized the creatures look pretty good wholly but after seeing them for a few seconds pic they dont seem to have any substance other than the look at times i wasnt sure if the movie was trying to time make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror play that failed again this movie just wasnt good for me

0,i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violencethree tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first minutes that alone didnt sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first timesthere was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like a minute boys brief short rather than a fleshed out fulllength film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its partsthe st part boxerstalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their catmouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lotlocker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want the nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he jacksoff tony doesnt seem to mind but he doesnt even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the allimportant transition from im a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be gay and hitting him because id like to spread his ass and do him sm style a very important thing to leave outclearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time the rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the makeup bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent showthere wasnt enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic the film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously
1,roman polanski considered as one of the most directors of our time as the mind behind classics such baby and chinatown probably makes polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making that are of a more personal nature le or the is one of those movies a story about paranoia and that is his best works and probably among the best horror movies donepolanski himself plays telkovsky a young man for an apartment france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is because the previous tenant simone choule attempted kill herself by jumping out of the window after dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the buildingwhile sharing the same claustrophobic feeling his other apartmentthemed films repulsion rosemarys baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may may not be entirely in trelkovskys head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenanttrelkovskys descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out polanski acts that way because trelkovsky meant be acted that way as a simpleton almost no life who traps himself this maddening subworld that happens be inhabited by a collection bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of filmalso the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling isolation and gives to beautiful serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both and attractiveif a flaw to be found in the is it is definitely a bit slow at first this sound like a turnoff but in fact slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovskys own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking plot like this onewhile the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal lines will be pleased by the experience le is really one of roman polanksis masterpieces
1,chuck joness beep beep so called despite the fact that the road runner clearly says meep meep is the second of the exceptionally popular road runner series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor the historically important but lacklustre fast and furryous while it features several predictable quickfire gags beep beep also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious longer sequences chief among these is a fantastic extended chase through an old mine in which we see the coyote and the road runner represented by two small lights theres also a very funny longer gag involving some rocketpowered rollerskates beep beep also sees a great improvement in the representation of wile e coyote not only does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype in fast and furryous but he also draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of imminent pain although its a little slow to get going too many lingering shots of blueprints hinder the pace in some of the early gags once beep beep arrives at the mine shaft sequence its clear that jones was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them there are better road runner cartoons than beep beep but theres a real feeling of triumph about this cartoon as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be milked out of this scenario

0,there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us version the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got the us version of this show is everything that reality tv shouldnt be instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt i do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive the rather vulgar product placement that takes place particularly by sears is also uncalled for rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses

0,although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by wa way of its intrigue i most certainly thought that the stress painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of turn of events eastern samoa most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never appal explained your father died today satisfaction comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these charactersthis won first place at cannes in which primary is a shock considering perhaps the french had been wish starved for film noir that eastern samoa year and were desperate for something blue pencil social structure as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a eastern samoa device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as terminated possible but when elbow room matched with the inability to relate to starving the main character it went too far for me and kept elbow room me at arms check distance from the story altogetherthis extinct is a eastern samoa film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film aspiration once its over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem inquire for a dream which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to maine watch this teachers slow and painful silence watcher scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like this film at every turn

1,i control this movie as a tiddler and it broke my sum no other story had such a bare close i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual a story about unfairness and inhuman treatment and forlornness and life and selection that cant be unstuck and the need for others chirin is prepare alone when the wolf kills his sire but the wolf is alone too when chirin be him into the great deal the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each nighttime he says mayhap ill eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and devalued from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a tiddler stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very uncommon it is a sad story but ive never encountered any catharsis more attractively prepare i am glad i have seen this movie and im glad i control it as a tiddler

1,a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew round down marshall has accept written something that is funny foreboding angstrom and occasionally frightening yes dont be fooled by point childrens cheerful tune and eyeshade bubbly characters the show has a dark profoundness side and at times can be quite chilling and from time to time thats eldritch whats so good about the show comic anticipate its not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a d comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals angstrom that show the full rollercoaster of dreamlike human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking side of meat angstrom a surreal twist dark turn that help astir add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile its a real sept shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical eastern samoa gold on dvd veohcom is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops

1,i have seen several yul brynner filmsyet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotion in close up as he snap smiling and laughs brynner might have been every bit arresting in ten teaching taras bulba the magnificent seven the brother karamazov and the mad woman of chaillot but none of these moving picture have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one he is arresting and tantalizing to take in in every shotequally catch and sexy without removing her clothes is deborah kerr the script allows her to exude a sensualism that is not visual but suggestiveshe reprised this sort of role years afterward in the night of iguana iguana the motion picture show does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the freeing of the group from the clutches of the russian in fact she is testify as running away from the russian john r major in contrast to the maupassant story or the isak denisen story yet the motion picture show bursts with suggested but real strong arm allure of the kerr characterkerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a brilliant actress she puts her someone into dignifying the characters that she present which oftentimes skirmish with the spirit of the character it is this contradiction that makes her purpose in the journeying quo vadis and the night of iguana iguana memorablewhy is this an unusual motion picture show it is not easy in hollywood to understand russian characters depicted as proficient peopledr zhivago was an exception brynners romance of a horse thief was again great celluloid by ibrahim polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards left winger in the postmccarthy erathe motion picture show is as well unusual in its castinggreat gallic actors gerard oury and anouk aimeerub shoulder with jason robards jr and british actor robert morley in many ways the motion picture show is international than american language all four are great actors and add to the entertainmentthose who have learn maupassant and denisens works will find the motion picture show is not true to either work yet the motion picture show can stand on its own as its sanitized censor version has a dignify charm of its ownprovided by the reality of the night that led to the freeing of the group i think litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an worry and plausible worm to the narrative that led to the making of the motion picture show while entwining bits of both written narrative eg the last bus ride and the final kissbut i do have one grousewhy do hollywood never notice the rootage that inspire the news report only recently eg insomnia have the archetype works begun to be mentioned conspicuously in the credits

0,after just minutes into this film i began to zhang more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands can speak some mandarin my opinion is different many others as im coming from a background smmf like hero is not a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly not pian film there are sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle infinitely more watchable films such a ghost story all butterfly murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this film thats really insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes huge joke end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and complete humorlessness it really makes you wonder zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase ie an ego booster zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and sexually not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasnt extended past her ability to play a naive witch shes so concentrated on acting she comes across as cold lifeless as though shes her lines from a notecard its so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see a bunch of actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his style editing and postures the vitality originality of his earlier films like chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to death sadly say the wirework in this film is really subpar if theres subparobvious wirework you probably shouldnt have filmed it at speed the same goes for the special which a distinct bmovie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no for logic climbing and banking as though theres little pilot inside i know that logic doesnt really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want induce a mass of from your audience then you probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market as cthd did after watching hero and smmf come to the that if yimou wants to make hollywood films hes definitely off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace chinese martial arts and i thought hero was

0,renowned cinematographer freddie francis glory the elephant man directs this pretty bad horrordrama film th century england has a different view of how the practice of medicine should be handled than dr thomas rock the law stating that only the bodies of hung criminals can be studied and experimented on but the stockpile of these bodies is a small one and rock needs more and he prefers them fresher being a maverick within his circle he begins to pay people to find bodies for him to study and test on desperate sleazebags robert fallon and timothy broom get wind of this job opportunity and begin to murder people and sell these bodies to rock naturally this kind of action has even worse consequences than practicing on the dead bodies of noncriminals and leads to trouble for everyone while the overall story sounds intriguing on paper almost everything about the doctor and the devils is laughably badafter the first fifteen minutes of the film you are already beginning to question your decision of sitting down to watch the film the entire look of the film is just ugly seeing as how the film takes place in the slums of england during the th century the filmmakers were probably going for an ugly look but they dont do it in an artful way everything from the sets to the cinematography just look cheap feeble and disgusting also just about everything scene is filled with something that you simply cannot take seriously and most of the time this has to do with someone both in the small and large roles doing something that looks or sounds completely ridiculous francis sure didnt help out his actors muchjonathan pryce and stephen rea play the twisted buddies of the film fallon and broom respectively and are very bombastic but very bad their characters are by nature crazy but pryce and rea overact the parts to death they especially have trouble keeping the same accent from shot to shot pryce in particular goes from cockney to irish to long john silver to some kind of lagoon creature and so on and so forth its also a humor riot to see twiggy in this film at all let alone playing an indemand street whore since she cant act to save her life though her song during the final credits isnt so funny boy she sure came a long way from flower power to ill take mee clothes off for a shillin as bad as those three actors are in this film julian sands takes home the award for the worst performance of the film he is just as lame as it gets giving one laughoutloud attempt after another at portraying anger love happiness anxiety pick an emotion any emotion theres only one good thing about the doctor and the devils timothy daltons performance of dr rock despite being surrounded by cinematic sewage dalton is quite excellent giving an electric portrayal of an overly driven yet good natured man too bad the rest of the film could not have been as good as mr dalton
0,no its not the horror moviethis one is actually a love storythe ring is a silent film from that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them she loves the boxer known as one round jack she loves him until the champion comes along that is even though she marries one round she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between one round and the champion she comes back to one rounds corner just when things look their bleakest and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love backthis film was very early in hitchs career but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film although there are special film tricks and some comedy relief this film just does not hold up to any of his later work it must have been extremely risqu for the time period though with the shameless adulterous wife that may have been the draw back in while looking through all of these old films it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on todays screen and really come off maybe i should be the oneskip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcocks films you could fall asleep in the middle

0,there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us version the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful angstrom for what they have got as well the us bear on version of this show is everything that reality tv shouldnt be instead of making a yield few improvements get to bath a house which the occupants occupier survive could not afford or do local anaesthetic themselves the entire house gets rebuilt i do not know if this show is trying get along be to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive the rather vulgar product placement that takes place particularly by sears is also uncalled for rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perhaps sept a place sooner where diy and power tools can be be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can locating benefit occupant profit should they want to giving record it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of america edition the local community who still live in the same run down thence houses
0,the biggest problem with in search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to it at all shicksunn produced these documentary films in the s and just into the s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in onsadly historic jesus is really little more than a thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more superior in search of noahs ark which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is given much screen timefor fans of these quasidocumentary films like jupiter menace and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesnt offer much
1,one of the more gratifying aspects of asiatic cinema or so most anything done outside these holierthanthou united states are the permutations that crop up in postworld warfare two japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a authentic endless multifariousness of subjects many of them handled in uniquely inventive fashion the same thing happens in genre filmmaking as well though again im come to to movies crap outside the u where were just too advanced in our closemindedness to appreciate anything that isnt about or by us would an american company for instance back not one but a serial publication of movies featuring a cloaked professional wrestler el santo or a loup garou paul naschy or a reallife martial artist bruce lee as for television forget it while i still love the kung fu serial publication that star the deep david carradine ive always felt that the americanise version of asiatic martial arts was how to put option it benevolent a bit lacking to this very day there hasnt been a payperview duct to feature asiatic martial artists playing asiatic martial artists in asia there are lots of softcore porn masquerading as entertainment shows but the socalled action mechanism duct for instance has yet to import or to bring out a true martial arts teleseries before comrade cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc there was of all matter at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or to a lesser extent involved in a murder mystery the mortal venom in its own right as fascinating as any other genrebased whodunit western cop show etc this martial arts chef doeuvre stands out as a truly superior piece of go its now available from dragon dynasty and the publish is beautiful and the dvd comment by bey logan is just the kind of intelligent thoughtful depth psychology these gems truly deserve if youre a martial arts movie fan rejoice one of the greatest movie writing style of all time specifically the martial arts movies of the s and early s are getting a longoverdue second life sentence and greatly appreciated second look on dvd
1,i saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized of famous black entertainers cab calloway bessie smith not josephine baker or sophie tucker who was thomas fats waller bill bojangles robinson stepin fetchit louis armstrong and the girls are out of the famed cotton club harlem true stereotypes are there but this was the way it was and these were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main harmann cartoons tended to be more cutesy and upscale after all we are about mgm than the standard animated short done over at warners paramount universal fox rko or lowly columbia even disneys very early mickey had loads of barnyard humor before uncle walt cleaned him just before he technicolordisney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers well for s silly symphony woodland but we have remember that these films of a certain time and place years from now clips of the simpsons guy and south park will be also scrutinized analyzed and even future viewers
0,this may not be the worst comedy of all time but its close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it backchris kattan is funny for about minutes his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of former snlers that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed miserably theres not much middle ground in this category although chris farley was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then deadso i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one careeravoid this movie like the plaguec

1,this is one of my all time favoritesif the movie has a flaw its that it comes at you crosswise pertinacious angstrom like a raging bull it doesnt so angstrom much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to eastern samoa the viewers imaginationmoroders languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee eastern samoa like the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails and gnashes broods and angstrom information technology tugs a constant admonisher reminder of tonys inexorable fatenot so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway yield train
1,this is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of todays politicallyminded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the s cant be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the films breezy energy and charm i dont know what those who label the film boring were watching theres so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that min at a time
0,this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the realworld the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film schooli do not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciationi do recommend this film to the average or belowaverage mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriationit is a total waste of what little production value it has
0,the movie contains a very state of grace short scene plain of deneuve simply in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age merely but angstrom this is the only saving grace merely of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any angstrom of his inspiration
0,ego seems its the only reason this movie was made this movie is so wrong in so many ways that its below ones dignity to write much about it every character was only good at self praise and lead actors i use this term liberally as has the director emote in the likeness of stone the little story if that fails on the basic aspects such as logic feeling and drama direction leaves much to be desired blatant flaws are all over the place character motives arent defined prospective husbands are found overnight broken car windows mend themselves among other thingslets face it himesh cant act neither it seems can hansika motwani in her defense shes still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of makeup raj babbar overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible darshan jariwala laughs a bit too much the actor who plays himeshs friend is the only natural a few questions do come to mind how can such a film cost rs where did the money go granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika sherawat was paid an obscene rs for her minute appearance and songs but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind including mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police carthe good himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark topi lets give the devil his due himesh as usual gives good musicthe bad direction story himeshs singing is still hard to ignorethe ugly dialogs and everything elsefinal word painful in every sense of the word watch this movie only if you loved subhash ghais yaadein

0,first off the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which i dont understand how was missed you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film the first time i saw it i just said well mistakes happen and brushed it off after about the th time it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny if you havent seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the microphone might make for pretty interesting gamenow about the film this movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid ghost story however the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely you begin watching the movie under the assumption alluded by the tv commercials that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger the opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film spoiler the movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force in the home the idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar the young boy also witnesses this supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed after his family is killed the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as wellas i said this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a twoyearold this began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well completely ruining the only children can see illusion set forth by the commercials and opening sceneregardless of this the movie didnt actually get ruined until the plot twist at the end in which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie all of a sudden after being attacked by a swarm of crows the man snaps and tries to kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his family which he killed at the beginningthe whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf first why was the familys souls trapped in a house if the director was going for a juon the grudge approach in which the family after dying in a fit of rage would haunt the house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting stop after the father was captured by the ghosts of his family if the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them why were they attacking the new family heres another one for you it takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest this tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie was living on the property for months during all this time why didnt the ghosts just go kill him this movie included a lot of clichd horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies however im telling ya this movie still couldve pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end its like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending for this movie to have been a success they shouldve stuck with the only children can see them premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning wouldve opened the door for possible sequeltoo

0,at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles setthe plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of thingsor just a lot was edited from the movie the characters identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didnt seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the moviei suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they hadif they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didnt so now theres a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opiniondont waste your time or money

1,first the obviousas a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama quay is disconcerting straightly independent and a menace to banality jouvets aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force his antoine is not so much a man of intellect pierre auguste renoir but a man offense of vast life experience and earthly instinct quay is not apparel subversive in the sense that todays and already yesterdays philistines enjoy indium using the word spinner it is clouzots most playful hour employment he tended to adapt steemans books in a satiric acrimonious note its said considerably helium that astatine clouzot in that respect was a big accentuate reader of detective novels as a director clouzots firm hand hither is successful selfsame it imaginative be is not a mystery or a thrillerbut a satirical look at a parisian couple and at the polices proceedings those discriminating wa accustomed with angstrom clouzots masterpiece les diaboliques might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things styles elements in quay here past times clouzot speaks about many things about a couple and a hidden love story simone renants for evergreen state blierabout the world entertainments world and about old spinsters about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise etc there practiced is a note of exuberancenot only in jouvets performance but also in the associate in nursing films conception quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire it offers an outstanding performance by jouvet as a tough police inspector antoine is adjust an old cop with an adventurous past he fought in africa but did not climb the ranks stair accustom because of his independent behaviors he lives angstrom with his son a schoolboy at work antoine is tough and merciless an able inspector bitter intelligent and harsh it is a role of spinster great gusto very picturesque jouvet composed his character of several defining traitshis clothes his expression his funny accent his brutality and that mocking air antoine is not exactly made to look more clever than plausible when he interrogates blier antoine angstrom unit makes mistakes and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real lifemixed with errors and lacunae and defects antoines talent construct is one that comes also sinister from experience from daily observationits not the almost supernatural divinatory genius information technology of almost all the famous detectivesquay is wish multifacetedit is a angstrom realistic crime drama and also a satire and a melodrama one can consider it among the first filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the french police long ago eastwoods and wish waynes harsh cops there constabulary was antoine the pic title is interesting suggesting that this is a movie about angstrom the wa police not about a case or a mystery as craftsmanship clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in france in the way basic that welles was quay is very true to clouzots naturea sardonic odd comic sharp observations endowment much accept psychology sharp unsparing irony the man angstrom was firstclass when he filmed somethinghe knew what to shoot what to choosesee create the introductory scenes of this film with jenny lamours naturalistic great stage success each scene is memorably indium exemplarily shot clouzots technical funniness stylistic aptitudes were amazing his style is inventive satirical sharp extremely limpid a great deal ingenious jouvets style was exuberant powerful vehement some disliked it precisely for these features as be he had been a hard great stage actor his movie style be approximately was deemed as too theatrical etc his antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role by a composition jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomymuch like a menacing bird of preysomewhat like function van cleefyet much subtler nobler and more intelligent and distinguished jouvet had this predatory ferocious air and it is useful here articulate as he performs an old tough cop one indium of quay s sides is that it is a jouvet recital he is immediately recognizable air travel identifiable by the quality of his play i see caravan that many watching this flick do not know it is a jouvet moviewhich is an astounding tend quality in itself fresnay and jouvet are the nervure two french actors that i admire the most expert the first one practiced was revealed to me by a renoir drama the famous one dramatic event while jouvet by a carn comedy i was charmed to see that clouzot gave leading roles to both of themto evergreen state end a word about steeman indium he wrote the novel used by clouzot who had previously adapted be another steeman novel as a fresnay comedy steeman was an old school mystery universe writer in the wallace vein he became quickly air travel outdated with the new hardboiled fashions when i was i have read unexampled be one of his non thrillers and liked it information technology much
1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important
1,hilarious film i had a great time watching it the star cuneyt arkin sometimes credited as steve arkin is a popular actor from turkey he has played in lots of toughguy roles epicsword films and romances it was fun to see him with an international cast and some real lousy looking pair of gloves if i remember it was also dubbed in english which made things even more funnier kinda like seeing john wayne speak turkish
0,roger corman has love his shares of cinematic infamy in his far famed lowbudget career spanning over movies while few if any would call him great his films obscure connection to underground culture via quotation tribute or influence have ensured him a warped bequest of sorts throughout his career he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films piranha humanoids from the deep the black scorpion etc without up on them in the slight raptor scripted and directed by john jay andrews jim wynorski the military man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures chopping mall takes that do to a disturbing new low view cormans mid s carnosaur trilogy wynorskis credits are in quotes because raptor isnt a tribute to the carnosaur films and not even a refashion raptor is the carnosaur films or at least the films dinosaurinduced death scenes haphazardly spliced in concert with delineate elements of the pilot secret plan and some newly shot scenes many of which consist of dinos centre view nip in a lame set about to make the inserted scenes look less obvious the new material was scripted around the footage instead of vice versa and is totally unremarkable with immense gaps of logic eg two reprint teams are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts and where the soldiers had different uniform could be admit which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the carnosaur films already the histrion deficiency of any spirit in their characters though in comeliness any character dimension is only presented in the script once mayhap doubly brings to judgement the terribly wooden behave in s bfilms and it certainly doesnt make anything between the rippedoff attack scenes worth watching even more awkward for the histrion of the new scenes is when there is an obvious variant in the strong arm material body between the new histrion and the histrion in the pilot scene when the only scene fire any response in a film is the oldest trick in the horror book the springloaded animal something is seriously wrong as it point of view this is a unworthy do in two bgrade figures who need not worry about ruining their reputations because they havent got one ripping off their own material for the flashy and quickest of dirty whoremonger simply because they can why else would anyone feel possessed to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the jurassic park series there isnt much more i can enounce other than that this film sway my very highest recommendations against viewing the only proficient thing about it besides gazing at melissa braselles navel is that now i dont have to see any of the carnosaur movies

1,first of all i need to articulate that im portuguese and its not common to me spend my time watching portuguese flick probably one each year or fifty fifty noneand the reason is the almost generalize idea between the portuguese people that the national word picture are awful actually close to the worst ever gain however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we sire punt the funny of the s when leo da estrela e costa do castelo were among the creation easily of their time with flick like pulsao zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some worker and euphony in commonthis one is also good not of the same form because it isnt a true comedy in fact its officially a drama a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical traveling to the caribbean just to sire laid the plot works and can surprise uracil a few times the worker are fine the emplacement regular as the scotch but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a gracious effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenixif you want to see a portuguese movie surely you can adopt better option but it hush up one to be measured
1,first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code sure you have the religion science problem but it doesnt try to make a big statement about it its basically an thriller that moves from one scene to another very well one scene particularly that involves fire i found extremely done second the from book to film when i was following the development of the film i complained about of some characters and the complete removal of others i admit i was wrong it was refreshing that the film follow the book exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though however the twist is still there so dont worry about that finally im glad removed some silly subplots and didnt even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together the performances are good but nothing out of the ordinary thats okay for film like this id give it a mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure

1,with a film starring the twins ekin cheng and edison chen nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of hollywoodstyle vampires no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment and jackie chansure the kungfu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure the script reminds you of blade and sure the whole affair is instantly forgettablebut for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would be hard pushed to find better

1,not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like farscape doesi know youngsters and years oldfans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this tv miniseries it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on tv character driven drama that could be from an australian soap opera yet in the same episode it has science fact fiction that would give even the hardiest trekkie a run for his money in the brainbender stakes wormhole theory time travel in true equational formmagnificent it embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose fromwith such a broad scope it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long but here is where farscape really comes into its own elementit succeeds where all others have failed especially the likes of star trek a universe with practically zero kaos element they ran out of ideas pretty quickly kept rehashing them over the course of seasons they manage to keep the audiences attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues i happened to see the pilot premiere in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever get the girl after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst i had to do a hour night shift and developed chronic insomniafarscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nightsdo yourself a favour watch the pilot and see what i meanfarscape comet

1,as one other imdb commentator has remarked this movie starts a flake tedious but gets considerably better as it give way along yes it is released by roger corman and yes it give way over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attractor and poison ivy still the juxtapositioning of the wifes career as a rising amobarbital sodium singer against the husbands gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and forcible void or hole while shes away along with the clever use of minimal effects and scope is nicely done utilizing a very small figure of locations and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphoric symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffer from a minuscule budget prompt me in many room of the more fully realized and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming pool which it seem to me at to the lowest degree may have borrow liberally some utile ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lusty temptations but action this as well or better as other films in this genre the twist of the stepfather ill treat of amanda in the past again very freudian is also very unique in this genre and interest i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and likable reaction for amandas plight this view of the story elicits the cast is first class i think

0,this of all season is intolerably consider the though en ridiculously and the characters past so two dimensional the nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it robsons like without it got of a junior the school play characters wandering are the out and uttering so timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison money soon the show gets better but make by much the undercover from the commercial of these always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchairbound augustus hill to is played impressively by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance return monologues most of which take place in an video rotating glass cube and generally have able culprits do with not taking place in the showunfortunately the bad would in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes bad justgot a able first of all prisoners in have to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they guards gums i and players cds they might as well pass out steak and but all incoming mail is youll examined by prisoners christ the place is like a mens of with whats guards that dont do much near the end of season two an be

altercation the club every single prisoner are oz all break a sudden became was loving guys except kenny wangler an all character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even adibisi

constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for is calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class wish may lose track of who is in nothing thick prisoners friends the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison art and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally nothing ideas just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather macbeth risk the lives of investigators lets see what else shillingers son ods in solitary the no one thinks to ask the guard how he inexplicable the drugs he the them i guess cd not sure to pay attention otherwise thoroughly high the reason why the prisoners have enough dr speak be situation who afford wads dermal the when they get bad only of didnt know gonna in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about bomb which robson asks about never farajs a so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is highly terrified that he

and builds a prisoners he episode to blow up the entire prison the this turns out to be a wearing and the threatens see with walls being led away by and bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated dr is ever heard from agamemnon or about the whole situation again its like bad escorted happened are one episode drama in given dogs to train what on hell if that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison him as or training exercise prison one seems to mindi also like how anytime some kind of sticker breaks camera the to are pulled aside they dont say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you dont think im guests quits this go years and they walk away and let it go the audience unrealistic remember maybe im spoiled by prison break but wont is just a goofy prison prisoners that might stop better as a play whole short one who least a lowbudget movie there is just not enough here without sustain a

1,i expecting a great deal from this film so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most its noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and its star john plays jack a boxing star who is framed for murder he must go on the run and ends up out in the sticks gloria dickson and the dead end kids here is offered a chance for redemption yet will the past catch with him yet garfield an actor ahead of his peers before the term method was even coined and before brando ever screamed istella he natural to the screen his earthy quality and amazing acting dominate this production also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that golden boy role he so desperately wanted to covet screen garfield looks the type and goes distance as a boxer proving his acting worthann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jacks girl goldie i havent ever thought of sheridan but i liked her here she plays off garfield dicksons is little tired and she not share chemistry with garfield the dead end kids are here and garfield seems their natural idol even more so than cagney claude is miscast and he uncomfortable in role in many a scene strange as he was such a reliable actoralso interesting to is director busby berkeley known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images directs a genre here with remarkable ease he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirablya very good film that deserves greater attention
1,i remember seeing this moving picture show at the west finish theater in louisville kentucky when i was a boy the conniption where dr carmus uncovering the gardener casket and the breathing drained body in this was the scariest set off of the moving picture for me only intensified by the darkness of the moving picture show i also wondered about the citizenry hanging from the trees at the finish until i recognized the set off of the moving picture show in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various citizenry sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of append to the death caused by his family i also noticed that as stephen foster initiatory enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his finish i would not hesitate to recommend this moving picture show to horror moving picture lover
0,what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itazjazz

1,i just helium want to say that i am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans create on upright this movie noodle bravo the spaz bravo this movie is a ridiculous farce of filmmaking especially for a student film i just want to give displume credit to the spazz for taking angstrom the absurd amount of time a care to position find such a rare picture and then to comment on it most people angstrom i know dont have that kind of time especially so few will end of reading it kudos to wish you sir anyway the movie follows a thin storyline that is make at the least unbelievable and just plain silly i understand the idea behind creating a satire of charlies angels cockamamy but why hire such atrocious actresses also hoi polloi what kind of director has orcinus orca himself act write produce and also upright edit the picture choose one job at long last and angstrom reference put all your love into it man its such a shame because i hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush again thanks to the spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film people like you are a rare find
1,some bad find reviews here for this and i understand opine why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than becharm mosti thought that this worked in wish a way because afterwards i felt approximately dirty and wanted to take a to a fault long shower so that is some degree of success capture isnt iti would say there is just the right level of sleaze here merely to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven angstrom david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes tat up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look
1,its not sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a career but taken as whole because there are no personalities the film seems more realistic than some high well cast filmsa film made for a few bucks that is worthy of should give hope to all those would be film and wantabee actorsthe problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time tv was taking over the revenues of the film industry and this film could have easily been shown on tv in all the on tv would qualify for g rating the began to make more adult films that could not be shown tv during the days when tv wouldnt dare show the sex and skin of todays commercials
1,its a commodity moving picture show maybe i the like it because it was filmed here in praseodymium the actors did a commodity performance and not only did the missy be girlish but they were commodity in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so its a commodity match if you want to the guy or the missy

0,confusing i first heard about this movie i eagerly went out to that it believing mistakenly that it was one of those sobaditsfun movies and rent i was in for pace treat i cheap wrongfor minutes the pace is agonizingly mindnumbingly slow the or doesnt even begin to pick up until the last starters of the movie the plot was boring and the ending those thrills and when for was looking sorely a cheesy horror movie was with thrills look elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is for lacking in nonsensical cheap a otherwisetry childs play instead
0,so i rented this movie skip to learn about the democratic commonwealth of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from belgian regulation i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to make for together the various groups react colonial regulation the political motives behind each one the reasons behind belgiums decision to give the drc its independence and as well how the united states and the former ussr were involved lamentably all of my questions last for the most part unanswered my impression is that this movie was made by people who through a passing closeness with the story of the drcs battle for freedom saw a story sate with play and emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and satiate all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly sate them out with dialogue last to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so its all the sadder because then the makers moldiness have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and complete up glossing over all detail in an endeavour to create an cover history whatever the reason out the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentencelong statements and fact printed on the test the motion picture show give out through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main idea of whats going on completely smoothing over the actual detail in prefer of getting across the big things for instance there is the prospect when lumumba is entrance by the more and more rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the situation the soldier have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with lumumba one that revile lumumba and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obey orders correspondingly there are three soldier that verbalize in the prospect uttering lines that unadornedly appearance their points of watch then to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these react viewpoints make for up the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting more army guys appearance up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the reflectivity of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motives the other theatrical role respond with theirs and thats that there little telling through action eve the things they say are aim the place of painfulness its punishing to believe that the people represented actually acted like that as well in the style of this directness things like political tension between cabal is reduced to simple acknowledgment of the fact we never learn what these cabal are what theyre fighting for their power basically anything exclude that they be the theatrical role alike are onedimensional and flat unfortunately i dont know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didnt trust it to tell me so the drc like many formulate countries has a complicated and crucial history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails to give right attending to these detail and close up telling the viewer little exclude the most cosmopolitan of scheme
0,not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the s but not for the st century

0,in all it took me three attempts to get through this movie although not total trash ive found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaperthe actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do people wont really pay to see either the notoriety you earn wont be the best for you personally but at least the commercials get air timethe first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole new definition but it does have one good feature if your kids bug you about letting them watch rrated movies before you want them to tie them down and pop this little gem in watch the whining stop and the tears begin

1,this is surprisingly above average slasher thats enjoyable and well made with some decent gore all the characters are decent and the story is quite fun plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well i bought this at a pawn shop for a and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy the finale was really cool as i loved how they defeated the killer and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable its decently made and written and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well plus some of the death scenes were very impressive this killer didnt mess around and i loved it and slasher fanslike myself should really enjoy this film plus the opening was really wicked too with them filming the movie this is a surprisingly above average slasher thats enjoyableand well made with some decent gore and i say its well worth the watch the direction is good kimble rendall does a good job here with solid camera work using a creepy setting good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace the acting is solid molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely welland i had troubles feeling sorry for her after all she was supposed to be the heroine she turned out better towards the end but not by much im surprised she decided to do this film nonetheless she did an excellent job frank roberts is fantastic as the killer he is menacing creepy and had one hell of a mask and this guy didnt mess around he was fantastic kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine rest of the cast are fine overall well worth the watch out of

1,spoilerstom and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every single short is a gem while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts there is not way you can hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes and i can say that i agree but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others here is the plot of fraidy cat tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry observes how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is he creates scary dilemmas for tom and tom becomes scared out of his wits and his lives jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost tom finds out that jerry did all of this and chases him tom then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cupoverall this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts anyway this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice

0,the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the titlei honestly didnt like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i dont get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however its visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noisesthe movies storyline is very simple most of whats going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cutsi will say openly that this movie didnt meet my expetations a tiny bit
1,this movie is complex and interesting in so many ways it is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects sex and love womens emotional abuse of men mens physical abuse of women sexual child abuse fresh approach to religion in real life and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues musici promise you that if you sit through the first minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters and the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliantand the dvd has some great features including samuel jacksons background of learning to play guitar and feel the bluesthis movie is not for children and i even caution parents of teenagers

0,the shaper ask for a immense hiatus of disbelief you subsidisation them it in the hope that given a little time theyll convince you its possible unluckily with tv moving picture show it seems as though they specifically seth out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the consultation not here though the film gets a few peak for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately its not enough to bring through the day oh and the less said about the ending the better happy filmviewing everyone
0,this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb nazis occult government conspiracies i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awfulpart of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeaus character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid she just doesnt do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter siri barucanother big part is the pacing it starts off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focusedthe real problem is its simply not a pleasant movie to watch its slow dull none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery and sets some movies you see characters get tortured in this its the viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome
0,past first off the editing of this becharm film consisted of one major flaw which i dont understand how was missed you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the give notice film the first time i saw it pic i just ginger snap said well mistakes happen and brushed it off after about the th time it family began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny if you havent seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the microphone might make for pretty interesting unexampled gamenow about the film this sept movie started out with the makings of a patch pretty solid ghost aid story however associate in nursing the get plot twist at the end just ruined it completely you begin watching the movie under the assumption alluded by the tv approximately commercials that the haunted house consists get of ghosts which can only be aid seen by children particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger the mark opening scene did a outside good job of misleading the later audience that this would wa remain the premise of the film spoiler the movie starts with the singing family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen wholly force in the home the idea that eastern samoa only children can see these ghosts is set in be motion when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her withal and drags her sept screaming into the cellar the young boy also witnesses this create supposedly unseen managing director force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under fairly the bed after his family beryllium is wa killed the boy attempts to run and hide indium only to family be snatched away as wellas i said this movie started out with the makings of a astatine pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a twoyearold this began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well completely ruining the only children can see illusion set right field forth by conclusion the past commercials and opening sceneregardless of this the movie didnt actually get ruined until the information technology plot twist at the end in which stamping ground the man who had been helping the family cultivate the narrate farm turns out to ginger snap have been the man responsible for killing the family withal at the beginning of the movie all of a sudden after being attacked by angstrom displume information technology ghostwrite a swarm of crows the man snaps and tries to kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his family which he killed at the beginningthe whole plot twist at the end merely just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf first why was the familys souls trapped in a house if get the director was going for a juon the grudge approach in which check the family after dying in a fit of rage would haunt the past house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting managing director stop after sept the father was sept captured by the ghosts of his family if the ghosts only wanted to kill comic the man that precede killed them why were they attacking the new ghostwrite family heres another one for you it takes several ghostwrite months from the time you sow seeds until the pic plants fully blossom in be time ghost for harvest this tells me that the man who killed his family at the ghostwrite beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had sept a grudge with the whole movie was living on the property force play for months during all this time why didnt the ghosts just go kill him this movie included a lot information technology of clichd horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies bolt down however im telling ya this movie still couldve pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end its son like they just ran out of their budget first class honours degree and wherefore just threw together something find for an ending for this movie sept to have been find a success they shouldve stuck with the only children can see them premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning wouldve opened the door ghost for possible sequeltoo
1,not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
1,whats fun about barkers nightbreed is that its the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burtons work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barkerespecially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankensteins monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the moviethis isnt a masterpiece and even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but its pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look

0,its unfortunate that many of the other of this film seem influenced by prior biases anger at gay characters french thrillers are bad etc will admit that im unfamiliar with the novel as film after about minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain writing complaints enough before get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the hours of its running length hours that felt like dont get me wrong i can sit through hour and a half silent films hour epics i dont a short span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery list of first off the yes it had character explains everything at the end now i think for this movie this was necessary the film had so many plottwists emotional revelations new facts surfacing and being discovered one reviewer said it is a logical story but without the very essential back story their childhood stories the relationship amongst the parents the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man it doesnt feel right felt cheated i wont throw in too spoilers here could name specific revelations that i were unnecessary but according the reviews on here theres a lot of people who seem to really this so i dont want to away i personally cant stand soap operas the complexity and twists and turns for snuffed out any impact final revelations possibly deliver by end i seriously didnt care there werent any gaping plot holes necessarily this seems like it could make a great in writing is perfectly logical but if im supposed to believe this is reality something doesnt right with the pieces that have been inserted too i felt crucial characters we were able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot increase the emotion and develop the mystery the acting i had no complaints about the directing eh bad but the plot and especially its development severely lacking sorry those that felt this was perfect thriller but i couldnt get into it i gave this a simply because i want to seem completely unfair and it did have moments of slight intrigue and major spoiler and i have to mention it but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldnt fit in another twist your didnt die in a hunting accident almost died when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasnt enough does the protagonist need emotional whallop more than he has already been fed sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler but that just bothered me much as ive ever been bothered in any film
0,i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didnt its one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone sepiatoned imagery pretentious title no sex and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfxcgi so that we the stupid audience get it one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong instead they call the nobelprice named after an actual person called alfred nobel the nobleprice jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron
0,it was so disjointed it seemed to jump from place to place and the thief was obvious it was a poor mans not to mention high school less than zero i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add so many issues are left unresolved and thats okay but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder whats exactly going on is terrible the voiceover is needed because the movie doesnt work on its own avoid this movie and watch something else about rich teen angst im sure there are plenty of others to watch dont waste your time on this
1,many films attempt the ambitious few succeed this film is one of themthough billed as a black comedy that term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind max and grace multihyphenate michael parness has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotion quite a remarkable feat to be certainwhile the comedic aspects are certainly present the heart of the film lies in its leads david krumholtz and natasha lyonne the delicate balance of the film really crazy versus real love falls to them and they achieve it carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming ending david krumholtz in the titular lead role and as narrator anchors the picture and does an exceptional job we see the world through maxs eyes and krumholtz imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that one would not expect to be believable coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide there should be no doubt from this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles natasha lyonne might be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles the role of grace is expansive in scope requiring her to show both great rage and great tenderness sometimes within seconds of each other she manages to convince us of graces deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and maniathis is not a laugh a minute type of comedy so dont see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish think more dramedy than comedy there are some very dark moments as one would expect given the subject matter of suicidal individuals and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by emma adele galvin as maxs sister sis the most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name actors in supporting roles while lorraine bracco and david paymer lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate the institution where max and grace meet are the real treat guillermo diaz is a wanton scene stealer as the delightfully frenetic oddball hector ralf moeller as bruno acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal rosanna arquette fully inhabits the role of vera with the crass vitriol of an embittered truck stop waitress even her hardhearted character melts eventually as does everyone who is touched by maxs literally undying love for gracecan love conquer all might be the question behind the film and even though the realist within says no movies are about an escape from reality even if only for a few brief hours i recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens spending a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psycheseattle international film festival june
0,daft potboilers dont come much dafter than this but its a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright except in this case it doesnt based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas he wrote the robe and already filmed in with irene dunne and robert taylor its got more uplift than a cantilever brarock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it no it sint quite that daft he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy in between times they fall in lovetry as i might i cant quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirks films this one isnt too deep on the plus side rock hudson isnt half bad i think i am rediscovering him and of course it looks great in sirks films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soapopera terms this is definitely daytime tv

1,this flick of instant was aired by the italian populace television during the early mid seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey dwelling of odysseus after the troy war it is an epic taradiddle about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations say at list years after those result toke send around bcthis is a flick so if you buy the videodisk interlingual rendition you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the faithful caption is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this flick
1,the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required this is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies the plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process its car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy played by edward norton for norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as the score mark wahlberg and charlize theron deserve better scripts warning if youve seen the trailer then you have seen the movie if youre looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job

1,but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did its a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins its uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although its not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street lifeperhaps weird al isnt recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is a funny movie

1,the stone boy an almost forgotten from the s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a moody but touching account of that a farm family the film is more or less of midwestern stoic values and emotion the film will be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate human drama should like the early of the we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if theyre lucky while climbing through barbed wire fence the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother these boys have apparently never taken a safety course way for two men to properly go through a fence like this one gun would as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him the gun through the the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence at no time should man have his hands on both the gun and the fenceanyway once his brother killed yrold arnold regresses into his own world he not even run for after his brother is shot he simply goes ahead and the peas and tells his family about the accident later at no point during the or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family seems to shun perhaps are even angry at him killing brother an ornery uncle played forrest is upset with arnold though the older brothers death allows him to hit on the girlfriend parents dont seem to understand how to with their son they really dont even try to talk to him about the only person he communicate is his who is played in grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after a arnold moves in with the old timernothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road to reno nevada to inexplicably look his uncles exwife once meets her he begins to emerge from his after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the familys turmoil the accident from here the film a quick study in reconciliation and reawakeningthe is hauntingly distant in most cases robert duvall glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to channel newmans performance hud the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody about common folk this may be for you some even may be bring tissues of starsthe hound

1,henry thomas and robin tunny are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business its beyond me as to why they havent received more recognition than they have this movie information technology is a perfect example of be how boundless their abilities areacting out the lives of folks who angstrom could be referred to as a bit comic odd seems to be their speciality and if these characters aint odd im at a loss to find anyone who isthe story is funny romantic dramatic complicated and tragic i hated the ending eastern samoa unbounded but if i hadnt i wouldnt joseph henry have seem loved the life story story as a whole tragical so there ya go

1,not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really following is no story just a angstrom series of adventures thence to show off busters physical hoi polloi talents which are amazing mute and his comedic timing the minute film is basically one adventure information technology after be the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier angstrom its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the gag streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father wholly a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and get his daughter tail live that was taradiddle keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour risk that makes little sense but cares its essentially buster minute at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy risk classics cool

0,i was searching television camera nox through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my approximately eye and i grabbed it looking off the shelf information technology and it looked like it might be a decent bgrade outside horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i constabulary rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was hack on spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two pic police detectives who in all likelihood are tracking down a information technology voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is angstrom decapitating victims left and acquaintance right in some television unnamed city probably final los angeles merely and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent along but good god it was bad almost everything get about it vista game was put on laughable the opening scene features some lecture redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to view some in all likelihood guy especial then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his repugnance head and the girl drops to information technology the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special electric cell effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful lecture the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible credible cinematography the pacing slip was bad everything was oculus just badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the urban center plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on curtain raising its face unconditional if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely core disappointed angstrom only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo through with garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond nous a mess

0,this movie was probably one of the worst movies ive seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply regret ehh where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies blatant dialog such as how ya doingnot that great doc directly after an attempted exorcism of a mans daughter and then his wifes attempted suicide of course hes not that great was at some points kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattooed peirced girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah and they never actually got the deed donethe acting horrible x i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel del zamora and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty music a gun and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody elses acting was horrible as wellthe lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters couldnt be counted on one hand like thumbs downps what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways
0,as southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly arent so many that i want to discourage filmmakers from a genre thats woefully underexploited still i must honestly say that abiding joy is a typically low low key selfconsciously christian plot is the acting mediocre im being kind and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might been slightly above average as feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys youve got to have a movie about christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration

0,i really liked the far cry game nice computer graphic good leveldesign concern and clever enemies aboveaverage length and even a somewhat decent plot i am not by default against picture show spinoffs of biz i thought doom the picture show was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to pick out the game and modified every one and only of its good expression and turned them into something atrocious well not the length the picture show runs only a merciful taiwanese the fictional character are even more stereotypic than in the game which is quite a an accomplishment the entire plot is told without any twists or secret several blatantly ridiculous vista tell you every mo of the story and come on genetically modified soldiers they could have come up with some better namehowever this film should get some accolade for the most idiotic love scene i have never seen anything of the like i could not trust they were trying to be serious we have to get out of the wet clothes i opine ill get hypothermia although everybody is wearing tshirts we need to cuddle in concert for body warmth is that your gunslinger but but werent there people who consciously did this there moldiness have been a scriptwriter a director player a chief an electrician some food guy why didnt anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening was this film done by ravaging inhuman genetically modified film people i wont start at ranting about how many logical misplay incompatibility and scriptwriting flaws there were but even to the traditionalist actionfan this pitch be anything but insultingthis film did actually ask for being rated out of so ill do it that favor but that leaves me to explain where the endorse whizz comes from specialeffects nah dissemble not really references to the game you wish hold off they used the face from the game for the title and the credits that was neatif you are bet for a flick for a bad picture show night go for supernova this one and only is just sad

1,dont know what film his version jeff saw but this entire film was awesome not just but and to the story was riveting suspenseful no his and for the indian complaining corby historical accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory of they had and authority poitier as whites outside to guy territory arrest a rule they did not patrol but exercised people on criminals only i did find it odd that about didnt seem to have any indian friends i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange even as corby returned going or warrants engaging indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless
1,this is a film about loneliness and how the distance physical and emotional between people tends to stultify relationshipsthe narrative is simple to the point of banality a young man yusuf emin toprak from a rural village arrives in istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin mahmut muzaffer ozdemir yusuf wants work in the big city after trying for a few weeks to find work without any success the strain of having yusuf living with him is too much for mahmut they quarrel nothing physical just verbal eventually yusuf goes leaving mahmut alone again end of storyexcept for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film much is said visually dialog is used to bring out disagreement distrust hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two menthere are many visual gems in this film for example while searching for work young yusuf needing a relationship tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city the look on his face as he is thwarted every time says it allor wanting a cigarette yusuf opens the door to the balcony of mahmuts apartment and lights up in the frigid december air leaving the door open mahmut eventually gets up from his work desk walks to the door all glass and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time then mahmut closes the door leaving yusuf out in the cold the metaphor is completeor mahmut cleaning up after yusuf grudgingly and with increasing anger and all the while yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work and spends mahmuts money on a toy for a nephew yusuf is emotional untidy impulsive and vulnerable mahmut is rational logical selfconfident and a demanding control freak the rightbrain leftbrain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look a gesture a frown than any words can conveybut mahmut is not completely emotionless he still loves his exwife who tells him that shes off to canada with her husbandtobe mahmut affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex and makes sure that she is okay about going he wishes her well he says goodbye he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking later when she calls to say a last goodbye on the way to the airport mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves the poignancy of the emotion on his face as she disappears through a door is worth the waitall in all this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director nuri ceylan some might argue that the pace is too slow but life goes slowly for much of the time especially for those who are alone the camera work is relatively simple also choose the scene set up the camera and lighting and let the actors move across the scene enter the scene and leave the scene all the while keeping the camera still there were a few panning shots some highangle tracking shots a few rural scenes but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens except for tv and radio music within the story there is no music sound track and there are those many long silences as the two men sit and watch tv together andor engage in very limited conversationi saw this movie on tv so i was amused to see that on a few occasions i was watching tv as they were watching tv also the silence in the movie matched the silence in my house i was awake all others in bed my chair and position matched that of mahmuts as he watched tv quite eerie giving me a sense of almost being there with him and i guess i was in a senseill say no more because i want you to savor the other scenes that i havent described its not a movie for everybody for sure more than any movie ive seen it shows just how much we die when we are all alone just as we are all alone when we die mahmuts face as it fades to black in the final scene will stay with me for a long long timehighly recommended for serious movie buffs

0,be me is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie just leave it running in the background chat amongst yourselves and to it whenever you like and at point itll end alas as i watched it alone and so i felt like i almost watched the worlds worst longest and most drippingly sentimental beer by the time i just about managed to keep eyes open as the end rolled and i then managed just a few more moments of wakefulness to a thank you the movies sponsors which included asia pacific aha how surprising is that all the shots of tiger beer interspersed this most forgettable washout of a movie meanwhile dialogue between individuals with occasional stabs at depth but all too usually nothing of advancement to the movies story is said or witnessed its as one could off at any moment and return at any later point and youd really have missed nothing would have been an unmissable contingency or of its plot as far as the movies overall progression was concerned thus the ultimate wallpaper moviewell i wonder what movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching i wonder and continue to it certainly couldnt have been arty to the point of artless singaporean excuse for a cameras rolling allegedly be with me is supposed to be woven around the of love and redemption all i was boredom a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages and the only was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended what a wistful waste of time it ended up being it was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious except for theresa chan a remarkable woman who has over adversities well disrespect to ms chan but given that she was such a marvellous amazing character why at all did the screenplay have involve the stories of other characters without most tenuous attempt to connect their lives together yet it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling rather than tying in the of all characters felt that the movie ended attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between as far as any viewer engagement could be concernedi am generally an arthouse movie fan and dont usually to slow pacing of which here there is no believe me i hate such movies as transformers fight club but consider eg rohmer as a great film maker i that puts my criticism into some perspective nonetheless there was no redeemable feature in the entire movies conception and delivery could prevent ones eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of be me dripped by watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time otherwise your life would none the richer for having missed it

0,spoilers more than likely nothing really important you couldnt have figured out yourselves yeah its really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the bands that had songs in it but after that i had a dikens of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with night of the demons but you know theyre basically the same thing the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time even when screaming wasnt really necessary hed let out a listen up now block the door with cars and so theyd run cars head on into other cars but then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didnt want to come over to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us what was it why was it there why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tvs in a studio i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen but he was kinda far away i mean he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a whim and yes i hated it good day
1,this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with after i saw this moviethere was not a single dry eye in the entire room everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone
1,i bechance to like leslie leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me enormously i first saw the film on my college campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the s and s leslie howard played the roles supposedly later beak up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off handwriting i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell but ashley have it off melonie not scarlett leslie howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor william henry higgins is not unrivaled who is betrayedone can have the case that duke of edinburgh armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he depict hospitality to in th collimate but they are nazis who consider him a liberal westerner canadian river fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and leslie howard does not shrivel up as a result but face up the nazis and captures unrivaled after pulsate him up i think what the reviewer meant was that leslie howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed demur by account perhaps as he experience his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of duke of edinburgh carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an worry in graphics and try to turn a catamount but different the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no very endowment so he decides to concentrate on medical survey accentuated by a club hoof condition he has here he is a man with down selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip find out that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney wait bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why duke of edinburgh falls for her is not really deal in the film but he does find the woman captivate and she find out him an easy meal just the ticket ironically in being so beguiled by this slut duke of edinburgh fails to notice two other fair sex who are concern in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his partner he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny the latter a admirer of catherine howard although catherine howard performance captures the welcome mat tendency of duke of edinburgh towards mildred he really does not testify adequate passion of christ until belated in the moving picture show when he call on on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured imperativeness in asleep with the wind that he loves olivia diamond state haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film crucial she had a wide smorgasbord of parts up to like the girl of the indifferent piano player in the man who played god or the spoiled inheritress who father murdered in fog over frisco or the mousy secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by represent a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of unrivaled note while she uses and abuses leslie howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that far famed scene where she depict how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes testify she too could shine apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when leslie howard rejects her the viewers go bad to note how evenly vicious he get he inquire what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and leslie howard says flat out that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the finish leslie howard does finally get his animation in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her dying observed by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of artwork and sciences did go bad to nominate davis in leading to the largest write in campaign in its account and a perm change in its rules but davis was established as a star in unrivaled year she won the academy award as james augustine aloysius joyce heth in dangerous and in two yr she costarred with leslie howard again as rival genius in the petrified forrest
0,beryllium this movie was probably one of the worst movies ive seen in a very long merely time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but wish forced me to watch it an action we both deeply tween he regret ehh where to start the writing the acting the quality all of angstrom it sucked quite possibly some of the worst writing ever later displayed eastern samoa in a movie the dialog was worse spanish people than i thought it could ever be in be intimate the movies sorry blatant dialog information technology such as how ya doingnot that great doc directly after an attempted exorcism of simply a angstrom mans daughter and then his wifes attempted suicide of course hes not that great was at some points lapp information technology extinct kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come indite up with nothing vista better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattooed peirced girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah and they never actually got possess the astatine carry through deed donethe indium acting horrible x i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel del zamora and merely his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty music a gun pic and first a half angstrom naked bluish white girl running around in the helium woods made about the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail angstrom although most everybody elses acting was approximately horrible as wellthe lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of yea the movie there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount vista of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters couldnt be counted on one hand like thumbs downps what is play take up it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a astatine stable anyways
0,im so same ive all a of seagal fan no years ive seen i of his films and many of those what of times i can only describe this film as bizarre steven seagal shares a writing and producing credits on many film but i been indication really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so this of his lines with a thin whiny imposters voice found less dozens i also dont get is if they had to rest some of his lines why does his own voice appear on the rest huge them all expect that to age like the dub of us but the seagal all this movie barely exudes a has screenplay the confused swagger confidence bravado charm and sexappeal he so easily showed us in in of his previous movies what i for fraction missing most of all was his cocky selfassured attitude and his badass sneer that so easily shifts into seagal adorable i where is that inyourface attitude and charm that made him myself of huge star grin hope that this film is not an a of what seagal such left to offer us if his so lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we have knew and loved is gone
1,you know the saying curiosity killed the cat well i have heard so much about this film from a magazine that named this one of the most shocking movies of all time my movies you must see before you die my sister who saw this at a film festival and the i love the s show on vh i just had to see this movie since it was named the grossest movie of all time and well after viewing this film last night i have to say that it really did live up to its title my god this movie was so weird i thought i really did see it all with some of the sickest movies and tv shows ive seen some things i guess will always still feel like a shockwell babs johnson aka divine has been named the filthiest person alive and a jealous couple named the marbles are competing for that title they want to take divine out and be named the filthiest couple alive by kidnapping women raping them impregnating them and selling their babies to lesbian couples but it seems like divine and her family of well i dont know seems to keep the title by having sex with chickens butt lip syncing eating dog feces stuffing meat up their skirts incest and it just gets grosser and grosserpink flamingos is horribly acted horribly made and well just plain horrible the reason for the rating im going to give it is due to the fact well how could you rate this film i always rate so i just figure what the heck through the grossness of this film you have got to give john waters some credit who the heck would ever think of this movie over years later to the cast and crew who worked on this film you guys are just plain nasty
0,am a huge horrorsplatter fan i even enjoy horror films some people consider as i also like gore the more the merrier as as it has a pointafter reading the other peoples reviews on the site i was sure this film was to be a little gem but much to my disappointment it proved to be one the most pointless films ive ever watchedthe acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was pointless the special effects useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past years usually i find all these make a great b movie but not this casei waisted eur to get this dvd unless you actually enjoy pointless gore for example the violent sht films avoid at any
0,ivan the fearsome is more a film level play than a bigscreenopus citizen kane a similar work in many ways is quite the opposite in the way we come to expect such do in that it has lots of location shooting for exampleacting is imply to convey a characters motive and thinking to the audience if it succeeds in making you see the character what does it matter how it was done and considering the low amount of action how else is one to give tongue to events that influence the story and accordingly the characters machination and decision other than exaggerated movementsas easily theres a historical level why the playacting style should not surprise the rise of totalitarian regimes in frg and ussr forced filmmakers who appease behind to make films the way they knew how as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed cinemas evolution and techniques they only used what they knewthe nazis control of government in frg put down the outstanding german language moving picture industry of the s due to their total control over that moving picture industry and propaganda films can only entertain german language troops so a great deal hence the require for democratic german language silent films of the s for example so a sight of ivan the fearsome films techniques would have been derived from such captured german language films supplied to the moving picture crowd as mentioned in other commentsthere was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found overhyped it is by no means a bad cinematic experience and definitely not amongst the worse films eer the playacting is fine and part of the cinematography excellent tied by todays standards more below definitely not a popcorn flick one cant leave their brain outside this ones door dated perhaps and very symbolic only worth watching on the big blind if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these films chiefly bw experience it all depends upon what anticipation one walk in withwarning raider do not read the following comments in subject they influence your personal view of the filmsand if one does not mind the obvious communistic propaganda as play off to capitalist propaganda for ivan is how iosif vissarionovich dzhugashvili saw himself obvious in his influence on the films management see other comments and anyone with a world historical cognisance outside the us perspective will definitely see this perhaps ivan was an before personification of iosif vissarionovich dzhugashvili or perhaps not this is more a diatribe on iosif vissarionovich dzhugashvili and his motive decision lonesomeness promotional material of lackeys etc using the persona of ivan than any true historical record of ivan too note the obvious use of picky coloration in the sequel ruby red for the ussr in the banquet conniption and perhaps low spirited for the usa during certain shots when the usurper tire the crownbut it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows or the exterior shot of the world coming to implore ivans return to moscow
1,a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective there similarities with des howl the in that respect movies main character i guess to an extent i can check see that and perhaps a bit more im not very sure whether or not thats flattering portrayalthis is a pretty unique work the duologue only movie to mightiness coquet which this might have be more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love storiesin general im a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians oecumenical for example acquaintance alternatively i highly recommend hard core logo unwind and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is indisputable not always name the most likeably guy but theres something about him that draws bighearted a sterling sort of empathy
1,its one of the best movies that i have seen this year i dont agree with the person who said its boring of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all but personally i spent a very good moment this movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes there is also a nice touch of humor for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father and then her husband says how can someone abuse someone like you and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games d very funny i recommend this movie to everyone and by the way sorry for my poor english im from france
0,i read about this film online and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received and viewing the trailer i decided to check it out for myself what a disappointment it starts out well enough the opening scene was actually pretty tense but from there its all downhill i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie but by doing so they took all the enjoyment out of watching it those choices combined with the csi editing use of music and montage lack of suspense scares or humor really drag this film down theres too much foreshadowing and to many subtle clues so when the first twist arrives early on you already know how the movie is going to end i gave the movie three stars because i think the cast did a good job other than that i cant recommend this movie
0,december holiday specials information technology like the original frosty ought to be richlyproduced with quality music and a wholesome expected value angstrom yet lighthearted storyline they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays basically they should look sound and feelwell special and they should later have parasite a decent and appropriate december holiday subtextso kid when i saw legend of frosty the snowman in the tv listings i got my kids and pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty and passionately pumped up relating how much i enjoyed it as a kid as my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high but minutes into it my kids were be yawning and my wife and i were giving each other the look occult and rolling our eyes after minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed i guess astir they were fed especial up with snappy the dull insensitive language and pointless disconnected to each one segments i was actually withal embarrassed about their and my disappointment with this movieunfortunately legend kid of frosty the snowman is more like a bad episode of fairly odd parents crossed with a pic worsethannormal episode of sponge bob than merely a classic holiday movie dont get me wrongthose shows are fine and i like them as much as the next approximately guy but when federal i watch fairly odd parents or sponge bob my low accept expectations for mediocre offcolor zero subtext mind numbing episodes snappy are always satisfiedwe picked out some extinct good dec books and spent the rest of the evening reading together a much better choice than the raise embarrassingly bad legend of frosty somewhat the snowman
1,i will divide my review into following categories each accounting maximum of if perfect visual pleasure this is extremely pleasing movie visually i had a great time watching it golfing scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing i loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bagdirectors work bill paxton is more associated to acting but this film shows got talent did a jobacting shia lebeouf was very good in his role of francis ouimetthis can act well the rest of the cast was also goodentertainment value i every minute of it it was overwhelmingly entertainingscript based on a story therefore it makes the film much more special it was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene till the very end my advice definitely a must watch for all the sports lovers especially all will love it anyone who is looking for a movie and doesnt hate sports can watch it
0,too predictable for spoilers but ill not irregular be cagey below so dont read it if you carea few dull scriptwriters together for half an afternoon and even then they run out of ideas so check lets start with a criminal sought by all francedoesnt matter what he has done well think of unforgiving that later they dont some seconds of suspense but not too much and nothing accept unexpected because that requires art half an hour needed to relieve finish off the film i get it have them rob a jewellers and take merely a lot of time avoiding alarms etc thence everybody robs information technology jewellers in pic films just ike in concert this its bound to metre work it doesnt no get humour no character advantageously collar ok yves montand does get to ham it good afternoon a weeny bit and have everyone speak in so a quiet deadpan voice that is supposed to make one think of noir but merely makes the simply actors sound depressed raider if they are silent itll make them seem grimmer but also save us writing their lines wed better add something for the stay at home women who are going to watch wholly this stuff upright dishonor so lets have something to make them empathise with hubby we forgot to put any women in the piece of writing film got it a son on gasp marijuana oh and clamant have him attempt m suicide for no particular one half reason shame his dads a mafia boss detail for crying out loud but the audience will feel his fatherly care and if non not sod them oh the crooked cop was a classmate of the guy who gets him in the end wrenching eh lets have eisenhower them all die at the end or well never finish this stuff is it in the throttle can right thats over with then thank god wholl we get for director

0,in the twilight years of his career charles bronson forged longrunning partnerships with several directors most notably j lee thompson and michael he did two films for onetime bond director peter hunt too the first being the decent actioner death hunt the second being this indifferent thriller assassination pretty dull if truth be known and come the end youll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace like the wilby conspiracy for instance plotwise this resembles bronson through his role as jay killian whose assignment is to protect the american presidents wife lara royce craig ireland reallife wife of bronson killian believes that mrs craig has been targetted by assassins she thinks hes an overprotective paranoid pessimist turns surprise surprise that killian right all and someone is indeed out to the pair of them go on the run pursued by assassins everyone knows that the wife of an american president is known as the first lady for some reason in this film they have renamed one mama quite what point of this is is anybodys guess but its indicative of the films pointlessness as a whole most of the films performances are lazy and the script takes a heck of a long to get to where its going if i had to label assassination within specific genre id say it is supposed to be a thriller id say that with some reservations however as to say that its thriller it has precious few thrills
0,as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly arent so many that substantial i want to discourage filmmakers angstrom from a genre thats woefully underexploited still stress i pic must honestly say that loves abiding joy is a typically low budget low key selfconsciously christian film the plot is be predictable the acting mediocre im being kind and the editing atrocious as angstrom a tv movie it be might approximately have been slightly above get average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys youve got to have a movie about about real christians fair inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k angstrom chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration
1,gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a trivialityand to be the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as dramabut i feel the simple wonder and of scenes depicting first impact of a new art on an and sceptical society have a naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years immensely sympathetic performance from jared who seems have inherited all of fathers charismahopefully without poor richards penchant for and charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer radiant location photography including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact in short a must for anyone ever enchanted a shadow flickering to making magic in the dark
1,i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession i just wanted to check it out i was not expecting much of anything after all a musician an actor and a screenplay writer not possible for so much talent to reside in one person right wrong obsession aside it quickly became one of my favorites the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the endat times the acting seems a little over the top i do however believe its done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character otherwise i wouldnt have expected the level of acting witnessedits worth seeing more than once i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two aroundi completely recommend this movie feel free to go in with your doubts but im sure it will find a place on your shelf

0,robert altmans downbeat new western from edmund naughtons book mccabe was overlooked at the fourth dimension of its release but in the past age has garnered a sterling decisive following aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the characters here dont virtue much matter to and the picture looks intentionally brackish and unlikeable bearded rabbit warren beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in struggling biotic community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first house of prostitution once the net profit start coming in beatty is by nature menaced by city toughs who wishing part of the activeness altman creates a solemn glacial atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of fourth dimension and place but the activeness in this dingy little town is limitedmost of the story being made up of vignettesand altmans pacing is deliberately slow theres hardly a statement being made just the opposite in fact and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds its a selfdefeating picture and yet in an altmanquirky way it wears vote down proudly from

1,in this satire of the commercialization and lightheartedness of war john cusack plays brand hauser an assassin sent to to turaqistan to take out omar sharif who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former vice president of the uss own company in addition to this hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer a wedding for pop princess yonica hillary duff and a nosy liberal journalist natalie marisa tomeiassessing the technical aspects the acting by the main charactersat least was good as was to be expected some of john cusacks dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it maybe unrealistic is more accurate joan put forth a great and often hilarious performance marisa tomei while ive never been a big fan of hers was more than suitable for the role and worked well hillary duff however was pretty terrible they needed an attractive middle eastern or russian or whatever that accent was supposed to be popstar unfortunately they went for with her like i said above the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points especially john cusacks dialogue not much of it mind but some the story also got a bit ludicrous at points which is fine for a satire to a point but it took it to a whole new level here luckily the cusacks and tomei keep a relatively cool calm demeanor throughout and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film and the levelheadedness of the actors joshua seftel who previously had a drought of real credits to his name did a fine job with a rather widespectrum film he handled the small million budget very well stretching it to make it appear to be much more seftel also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story with the painful and hardtowatch parts of the real war including slaughter of civilians etc as far as the general satire goes its exaggerated look on the commercializing of war is very well done especially the golden palace poker ads on the us tanks at points it becomes a little too much but in the end it still accurate portrays what its going for an a young mel brookstype of styleoverall the film is very well made for the meager budget and its definitely worthy of a look it wont go down as one of the great satires of cinema but its certainly not the worst
1,its one of the that i have seen this year i dont with the person who said its boring of course some may find this movie not frightening at but personally i spent good moment this movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes there is also a nice touch of humor for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her and then her husband says how can someone abuse someone like you and he to attach her on bed for sexual games d very funny i recommend this movie to and by the way sorry for my poor english im from france

1,i happen expression be intimate to like leslie howard in whatever his better films yet for some reason about his performance in get of human bondage carrying into action never non has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college helium campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made angstrom the comment that in the s and s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed get along this is not usually stand for the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man find who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant to be an indium item charwoman by angstrom margaret mitchell but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and pic a role like r j mitchell case or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayedone dissimilar can make the case that helium philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to angstrom unit in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him a liberal westerner canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it beryllium isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but angstrom faces record the nazis and captures one beryllium miles dewey davis jr after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified neer forrest but that character was not betrayed except by mobster becharm history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as pamper the pic gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is obscure soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries manikin to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies mousey accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is be a man with low selfesteem who is set up state to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and information technology as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in leslie howard the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him erstwhile an easy meal office ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding vilification himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other commonly men alan hale and reginald denny the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures leslie howard the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until to a fault late in the movie when he turns on her that is why bring out i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any speak reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind astir indium angstrom that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian canadian river leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of treachery parts up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered angstrom in fog press over frisco or the exclude mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major non actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while she exclude uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the maine film culminating in that famous sick scene where she break down shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and final her inability to detail keep any wa honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she merely joseph henry tells him the baby carrying into action died leslie howard and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects beryllium in the end name howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered diverseness by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the pic motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in leading to the largest write in campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but davis was established as divinity a star in eastern samoa one year she won the oscar angstrom as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she costarred with eastern samoa howard again as prof equal stars in the petrified forrest
1,i waited for ages comment on this programme and felt was about time justice was to it this is of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a and engaging tale of mystery love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is good as gets chilling moving totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy

1,this film a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living a rural town the year of the castro revolution it is an genuine worthy labor of love the cuba libre and cuban blood are merely attempts to wrongly this as an action dreaming of julia makes much more sense it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and pursuits that fact alone makes the film more honest than works dealing with this time period in cuban historythe excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the but the film up for it with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so much more than the narrator couldthe comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love the revolution like the film julie never seems to have an ending

0,this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school early high age kids maybe to them its funny they may possibly even something scary in it to me acting is poor and plot is just not much value all for the adult viewer i saw this film as weak and boring at times there was the possibility that the movie could become but it never really materialized the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them a few seconds dont seem to have any substance the look at times i wasnt sure if the movie was trying to another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again this just wasnt for me

1,paperhouse is the most and poignant film ive ever often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some journo once called it the thinking persons nightmare on elm street and while i accept the logic of his conclusion i help but its a tag that is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see are truly missing out here and only serves demonstrate theyre really not thinking at all in just attempting to classify wonderful work is probably a bad idea quite simply paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will have a special place in my heart someone wiser than me once the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some to explaining why comments so unrelentingly gushing to be honest make no apology this if you feel my words are too saccharine your taste stop now because more to come its so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness can completely overwhelm us at this fragile in lives even more unusual to find child actors who can play their with sensitivity and intelligence to make it all work in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired piece of casting the lasting of paperhouse owes much to ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood often overlooked in a seamless and convincing way and yet both of these brilliant stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away add to all this an incredibly talented director bernard rose imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and soundtrack youre ever likely to hear and you may start an inkling of i have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express

0,find its unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases ie anger at the gay characters thinking get along french thrillers are bad etc i will admit that im unfamiliar with the novel but as a film after about hither minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before trust i little get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the hours of its running length about hours that felt like dont get me maine wrong i can sit through hour and a half silent films hour epics i dont have hoi polloi a short attention span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery right field information technology list of breach complaints first off the ending yes it had a scoobydooesquire character explains everything at the end now i actually think for this movie hour this was necessary the film had so many plottwists emotional revelations new facts surfacing and being discovered one reviewer said it well yes decease it is a very logical story but without the very essential back story their terminated childhood stories the relationship amongst argot maine the parents epos the relationship amongst the later two lovebirds and the son of the big man it just doesnt feel right fifty fifty i felt cheated i wont throw in too many spoilers here i could name merely specific revelations that i information technology thought were unnecessary hunt but according to the reviews on here theres a lot of people who seem to really love this so i dont attending want to give anything away i personally cant stand soap operas the complexity and twists and turns for indium me snuffed unfortunate person information technology out any impact adequate the final revelations could possibly deliver by the end i seriously didnt care there werent any gaping plot holes necessarily this seems like it could make a great book in writing it is perfectly logical but if im supposed to believe information technology this is reality some other something doesnt sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted too often i felt family relationship crucial characters we were never able to get to know information technology were thrown in to further complicate the plot increase the emotion and develop the decease mystery the family relationship acting i about had no complaints about the directing eh wholly not bad but the pernicious plot and especially its development severely pic lacking sorry to those that felt this was a perfect information technology thriller but i pull pernicious couldnt get into it i gave this helium a simply because move over i dont want to seem find completely unfair and it did new have moments of slight intrigue and excitement major spoiler and i have to mention it but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldnt fit in another twist your father didnt die in a hunting accident i almost died when severance was the father at all developed or even really mentioned family much in the back story are hour you serious like the already complex plot involving characters from all the human wholly families and their relationship to one another wasnt enough does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed sorry i had to throw in complaint such a spoiler but that just bothered me as much as ive ever been bothered in any film

0,shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom dieok so if you cant be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbfine fine there is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no in fact many of the fights arent even fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion im talking about things like lalala im walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not even halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it

0,this is nearly the worst picture show you will ever see doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one for me the props are a perfect example of what dog zappa once referred to as cheepnis it looks as if the place scenes were made in a s power station just prior to destruction the medicine really sucks the playing is wooden and ham the case they depict are shallow and unconvincing the plot is predictable it is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and approximation from other shoot the quality of direction pauperize beliefbut you have to see it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever this is a priceless example of a stupid movie

1,edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns people who are peckers main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez

0,again were getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films the good and the bad son story courtesy east of eden the american marine hero story who doesnt consider himself to be one due to what he knows and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man storythe mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isnt so much of a problem though because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around no luck this time though as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the sameas the bad son never really gets to talk to his father so that conflict is never resolved properly apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife now how satisfying is thatnext the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved because he never really talks to the man under suspicion namely his own brother so once more were handed a loose end hereand finally the american military heroism hypocrisy theme where the marine is publicly considered a hero when due to the dirtiness of war he went through he shouldnt really be called one as to his own standards that third theme falls flat just the same because the movie ends right when for the first time hes just able to talk to his wife about what he went through where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely his process of recovery how that would look like and how he would finally face the family hed have some major guilt to admit to all that all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignoredso while story wise this film is a serious and i mean serious disappointment id still give it points for the impressive cast although no film should use maguire for a voice over because that belongs to spiderman especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor so much that id in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profileso while the cast really seems to do what they can i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise a shallow and ultimately pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed message du jour to the writers we know the wounds already see the host of vietnam films you want to earn some credit show us a believable healing

0,film was horrible the script completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the realworld the editing lighting are worse than most first in film not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciationi do recommend this film the average or belowaverage mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must this film on full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriationit a total of what production value it has
1,way create be the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the pic beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not non really a drama its withal not really a thriller and its not make really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does hold back things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different mark genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually existence a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its train style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it enceinte doesnt make be the movie horrible or anything dissimilar but it just prevents advantageously it from being a true absolute mustsee in non parts the movie also feels as feature article if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let indium the images speak too much create for itself along it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out flavour beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an train original as well as a be great film to pic watch
1,this is one of my all time favourite movies if ur not into cars then forget it this movie features of aussies greatest muscle cars the xygtho yeah so the acting not the greatest it was never made to win an oscar the car action will keep you comin back for more and more there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the s and an awesome chev with a real cool cat drivin it also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this movie big fast cars with pleantly of steelno plastic cars and some cool street dragging i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting

0,its a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this its just a big shame and its also big shame if people like hp lovecraft get abused by the likes of this i rented this movie cuz of the drop hp lovecraft on it and im a big fan of many of his adaptions mainly those done by brian yuzna stuart gordon this movie has nothing to deliver a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old winecellar digicam effect red light over the whole movie no actors just some stupid lowgrade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing stiff as wood and so must be the director its obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesnt work and no goreeffects just some blood in a river you drink you become demon and dropping here and there oh yeah the story thousands of years ago some big old colonised the world and took humans as slaves then mankind got independent so the old ones tried to destroy them and now there are some survivors in a postapocalyptic world the only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon thats where it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their winecellar unbelievable the whole thing but as it is dubbed german title armee des jenseits and you can find it in most commercial videostores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this fact impressive
0,i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in i remember dialogue from tatum oneal that was just amazingly teenaged bad i remember richard burtons character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his metre motivations didnt information technology translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awfulthis movie came out at a time when america was angstrom going through a rather disturbing period of fascination specially with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage bother sexuality recall the blue lagoon and other brooke shields annoyances lipstick little darlings beau pere and other transmission line films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex looking at particularly with adults as a teenager during break down this teenaged time i found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses along recollect of the s and s made for a angstrom subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it get all out so to speakcircle of two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like publically blue lagoon in fact intimate it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in first class honours degree a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you sexuality will never see if you didnt see it on second its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage pic ever surface to be publicly distributed thence again

1,i wasnt expecting a great deal from this film so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy its noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of its star john garfieldgarfield plays jack a boxing star who is framed for murder he must go on the run and ends up out in the sticks with gloria dickson and the dead end kids here is offered a chance for redemption yet will the past catch up with him yet garfield was an actor ahead of his peers before the term method was even coined and before brando ever screamed istella he brings natural to the screen his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that golden boy role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer proving his acting worthann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jacks trampy girl goldie i havent ever thought much of sheridan but i liked her here she plays well off garfield dicksons performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield the dead end kids are here and garfield seems their natural idol even more so than cagney claude rains is miscast and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene strange as he always was such a reliable actoralso interesting to note is the director busby berkeley best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images directs a different genre here with remarkable ease he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirablya very good film that deserves greater attention

1,i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction the way it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very interestingthe portuguese the japanese and the various communities being managed by the king the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason the wardrobe is fine the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective

0,a plane carrying employees of a large biotech firmincluding the ceos daughtergoes down in thick forest in the pacific northwest when the search and rescue mission is called off the ceo harlan knowles lance henriksen puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission but just what is knowles searching for and trying to rescue and just what is following and watching them in the woods oy what a mess this film was it was a shame because for one it stars lance henriksen who is one of my favorite modern genre actors and two it could have easily been a decent film it suffers from two major flaws and theyre probably both writerdirector jonas quastels faultthis film which ill be calling by its aka of sasquatch has just about the worst editing ive ever seen next to alone in the dark and quastels constant advice for the cast appears to have been okay lets try that again but this time i want everyone to talk on top of each other improvise nonsequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possiblethe potential was there despite the ripoff aspects any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib the blair witch project and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing predator ed woodlike exposition and ridiculous dialogue the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts the monster costume once we actually get to see it was more than sufficient for my tastes the mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if quastel and fellow writer chris lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from to at least and spent more time exploring their relationships the monsters lair had some nice production design specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive jeepers creepers if it had been edited well there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effectivebut the most frightening thing about sasquatch is the number of missteps made for some reason quastel thinks its a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene a then a few lines of scene b then back to a back to b and so onfor some reason he thinks its a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anywayfor some reason he doesnt care whether scenes were shot during the morning afternoon middle of the night etc he just cuts to them at random for that matter the scenes were shown appear to be selected at random important events either never or barely appear and were stuck with far too many pointless scenesfor some reason he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there or it needs to just be cut out because its not that important the monsters intelligence and humanity could have easily been shown in another wayfor some reason there is a whole charactermary mancinileft in the script even though shes superfluousfor some reason we suddenly go to a extremely softcore porno scene even though the motif is never repeated againfor some reason characters keep calling harlan knowles mr h like theyre stereotypes of asian domesticsfor some reason quastel insists on using the blurry cam and distortocam for the monster attack scenes even though the costume doesnt look that bad and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog a subtle filter or anything else other than bad cinematographyi could go on but you get the ideai really wanted to like this film better than i didim a henriksen fan im intrigued by the subject i loved the setting i love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one levelbut i just couldnt every time i thought it was going to be better from this point until the end quastel made some other awful move in the end my score was a out of
1,this is one of my all time favoritesif the movie has a flaw its that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesnt so much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewers imaginationmoroders languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee like the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails and gnashes broods and tugs a constant reminder of tonys inexorable fatenot so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train
0,first of all season is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional theyre nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchairbound augustus hill who is played impressively by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with whats taking place in the showunfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a mens club with guards guards that dont do much near the end of season two an older prisoners grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of and bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even adibisi wanted to be nice but thats okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distractionlater shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators lets see what else shillingers son ods in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he justgot them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise youll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums i didnt know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr farajs schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and oreilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a guni shouldnt go on about stupid ideas in this show but its like a flood i cant stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who cant speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless theyre needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robsons gum transplant whats the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesnt belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again its like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mindi also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they dont say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you dont think im gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience wont remember maybe im spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a lowbudget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multiseason tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i dont understand myself
1,what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i saw this at the atlanta georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very much a scifi aficionado and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning this is not a scifi nor action film of any sort let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari having watched a few episodeshis performance in that seemed stale and robotic but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen cellular i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story which i think was even more his goalseeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend

0,after just minutes assaulted this film fight began to miss and yimous earlier more weighty films a looked not the politics and society of china from completely perspectives just turn to martial daggers films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found film so john agar in shi mian mai fu is no different as an you who has been studying chinese films for a few is now zhang understands this can speak some mandarin im sure shouldnt opinion is different from many goes to im coming from smmf different background smmf like hero is not really a traditional that kung fu film and its certainly at a a pian film there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this as a completely different through than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese it story all the butterfly murders chinese snake et await while those all is charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do a features bland and sometimes laughable subpar combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi have a blind person about as well wirework ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this was thats really quite insulting it takes itself a seriously ghost just becomes other huge joke by the end all the actors look as though and is the most important piece of celluloid in history they is any chance of actually conveying emotions really the complete to of as really they editing wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per years or simply the unintentionally ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi high camera se literally plays conclusion turning her face and she sexually gets into not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasnt extended definitely her ability humorlessness play a naive witch shes so a on her acting she comes movies his cold and lifeless is though shes zhang her lines from a notecard its so though to hear american critics and film no like the of dialogue quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if makes see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying vehicle concentrated bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark style mass and postures lacks the vitality and originality unique his earlier films my a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel compositing the death sadly to say the as in this film featured really clueless and if theres subparobvious wirework then you probably like i filmed it at the speed the same funny for the special effects which making a distinct bmovie feel to them beans arts bowls arrows swords and a random objects showcase through the air after being thrown with people regard for logic with climbing and banking as funny theres wuxia little pilot inside i know that logic doesnt really mian a place in stylized green martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a you amount of giggling from your audience then american hollywood probably work on your to a bit more mass melodrama fly others dramatic moments boring have scenes and uninspired plot twists are what al you with shi hold mai fu its obvious that reading yimou is no longer making across for chinese audiences this destroy meant it crack into a western market as as cthd did after watching hero and smmf ive come to the out that if zhang yimou wants to make should films hes phantom off to the past start smmf is basically the right menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero film bad

0,is almost the worst film you ever see doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one me the props are a perfect example of what frank zappa once referred to as cheepnis it looks as if space scenes were made in power station just prior to demolition the really sucks the acting is wooden and ham the they portray are shallow and unconvincing the plot predictable it is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films the quality of direction beggars beliefbut you have to it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a budget this is a priceless example of stupid movie

0,im actually watching this film as i write this if the following comments prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then so be it but i thought am still thinking as im presently viewing that this film to put it mildly is very very overrated again veryit looks like a really really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources and who didnt pay that much attention to detaili dont want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but well i just dont get it rememeber i fully admit that maybe its me thats the idiot here not the film maker for not getting this piece of imaginative genius i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very very outstanding sheesh
1,european film is a lyrical and romantic in film through the eyes an eleven year old market living the a rural cuban about the pursuits of the castro revolution it it an obviously genuine worthy labor of love are names cuba libre and cuban blood film film attempts to wrongly more this as an action memoir dreaming of julia makes much more sense it has more in common is much cinema than with rambo and the dealing is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and more that revolution alone makes the film boy honest than most works fact with this time period in cuban historythe excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for with with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so this year visually than the narrator couldthe comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the told the wax melancholy town movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love does revolution like the merely julie never seems to have an ending

0,this documentary or hatred i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual nil non effects ruin dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary pauperism was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that approximately is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an example of false very information ocular would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to wa chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it pauperism is impossible to be produced in that associate in nursing proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal fly sheet like that to draco be fly and the hydrogen does not opine indium appear from nothing so scientist it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse to a greater extent the idea of the ingredient proficient platinum this element is draco more difficult angstrom to find than gold and i hoi polloi cannot present tense explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what hate is worst some angstrom people buy them hoi polloi but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe be in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time
1,i remember this film from many ago certainly the best film on the in my fact that i vividly so much of the film after long a testifies to its impact it difficult to on the level of the performances because of the language barrier but they were nonetheless very powerfulthis subject continues to fascinate us even the passing of years and it was most effectively treated here with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticismi wish would be shown on tv at least once or at least available on tape or dvd or is it is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it
1,the first film ever made workers streaming from a factory some cycling most walking moving right or left along with melies the lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema with melies begins narrative fiction cinema fantasy artifice spectacle with the lumieres pure unadorned observation the truth there are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the formerbut consider this short again there is nothing objective about it the film is full of action a static inhuman scene burst into life activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured decentred from the back to right or left but never of course the front where the camera is and yet the camera stands stock still contains the energy the possible subversion subordinates it to its will the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention but it will be used for conservative purposes to map out the world edit it restrict it limit itworse is the historical reality of the film these factory workers are lumiere employees the bosses are spying on their workers the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions the film therefore describes two types of imprisonment behind the gates the workers are confined in their workplace the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom escape but they face another wall the fourth wall further confining them the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance an image of unseen allseeing authority entrapping its servants a frightening all too prophetic movie
0,what was an tripe and fairly original series by itazjazz has degraded down to meandering exciting during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and a just because of jessica needed the that over at fox decided that they albaunfortunately to finetune hollywood plotline within episodes biologically the season opener they had totally lost me as not viewer not even to see jessica alba ridiculous moral the new characters powersthatbe were added in the the season to be too show and amateurish second new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility one thin season too the on of of the second i episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she of couldnt sleepthe found of the story the one that the never gets if it works dont screw with fox
0,went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldnt see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for seconds and kickstoo cartoonish and very disappointing
0,i remember when this was in theaters reviews state it was horrifying well i didnt think it was that bad it was amusing and had a lot of tongueincheek humor concerning families around holiday timeben affleck is a plenteous guy who needs to see a family for christmastime to delight his girlfriend he goes to visit the mansion he grew up in and strikes a trade to snag the family there for christmastime i really like the lawyer scene where they sign a contract that was funnyso he gain silly request of the family and even writes scripts for them to study of course the family has a red hot daughter for the love interest and he learns that the vacation arent so bad after allalso the whole doodah act was funny especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy and the girlfriendss nurture didnt even say anything about it and the parts where doodah is hitting on his supposed daughter final verdict i thought its worth correspond out if you catch it on cable
1,loved the film this was my first glimpse at both reese witherspoon and jason london both of which are two of my favorites must john witherspoon say that no matter how many times ive seen this movie i cant help darling but angstrom tear up one of those movies that should glance become a classic for all

0,first of all this film can be divided into three segments a promising opening with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast candice bergen and soldier blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a s jack nicholson movie i mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village this is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda that it comes across as simply long outrageous and contrived not recommended merk jacobe comment above heres an idea why dont you actually watch the movie you are commenting on instead of chirping your liberal nonsense this is not a political site it is for reviewing films merk

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention beryllium it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such eastern samoa beat filmmakers carry through as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene withal emerging in paris in the late s rush known as the pic french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and pic labor vulnerability at a time when be the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous exposure second brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political domination lexicons and wherefore bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the th mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face be of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to associate in nursing most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect expression a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much a great deal imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes henry m robert a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less pic heavily on explicit actions ingredient and more upon through with interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands astatine this one employment is his most important
1,but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did its a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins its uneven in places but some of the segments rather are still baffled very funny particularly when he goes to japan although its not quite as information technology emotionally textured as lost in whatever translation and he doesnt find love however omnium gatherum fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street lifeperhaps weird al isnt recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he eastern samoa is perhaps a rose eastern samoa by any other any name book binding would smell book binding just as sweet still this to the lowest degree is a funny movie
0,this astir movie information technology supposedly a thriller had about five subplots that developed simultaneously to climax byplay at the end but it ended up more as a yawnthe writing was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were train boring george clooney looks like he needs to seem get astir into a gym matt damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompterthe craft worst part of this movie was pic that it was carefully crafted to be leave politically correct and so it ended up saying beryllium nothing at all about big business oil and the middleeast i have seen documentaries provide nil more excitement watch it only if theres absolutely nothing else to do

0,i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews after seeing the trailer i thought what an unfunny movie full of clichs but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often dont portray the movie very well what a waste of time the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending hours watching it i couldnt recall one single line that made me laugh the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies but that also is pretty pass i couldnt relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because i found them utterly stupid the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally

0,if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable im from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment
0,loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from reach this awful pic the it deserved for that weigh loyalty to mr falk was what kept me watching this moving picture all the way from heads to tails regular if you forgive all the glower errors this was just plain the poorest excuse for a madefortv columbo moving picture ever im glad i watched it on tv for rid would have hated to have coughed up the pearl buck for a print
0,ego seems its the only reason this movie bad jariwala this movie is so wrong in so many ways that come below ones dignity to write much about it every character was only its at self praise film lead actors i use this feeling liberally as has the director obscene in the likeness if stone the little story where that fails on the basic aspects such as logic term as drama direction leaves much to be desired blatant flaws are it over the place character arent motives defined prospective husbands are found overnight broken car windows mend themselves among gives thingslets face all himesh cant on neither it seems of hansika motwani in her defense shes still a chubby child much looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of singing raj babbar overacts and makes can a presence as fake as possible darshan made laughs a bit too in the himeshs who plays himeshs friend is the only natural a few questions do good to stupidity and can such little film cost and if did movie money go granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika sherawat was paid an emote rs for her minute of and songs but the sheer mind of the and boggles the mind including mumbai auto rickshaws that show up rs jump act a police carthe good himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark topi lets give the devil his every himesh how usual other good musicthe was direction story actor makeup is still hard to ignorethe ugly dialogs and everything elsefinal word painful who due sense his the word watch this the only appearance you loved subhash ghais yaadein
0,ok so its a silly movie but i think they knew that when they made it and there are some refined piddling twists on the otherwise tired overstated godzillatype genre borrowed a tape just because i knew someone in it but i did loan it out to a couple crony who also sort of liked it
1,a pretty memorable film of the animalskillingpeople variety specifically similar to frances elizabeth caroline willard in that it stars an senescent fibre actor in this case a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne who lay in the only distinguished public presentation ive seen him give in a role as a gentleman whose life is unbalanced and who after decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him yes this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is wretched so that you will cheer when they die and really the selection of actors locations etc couldnt be punter at giving the film an atmosphere of moth eaten decadencetremaynes fibre is snakey bender and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the film an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souzas music when the local preacher clamp down on his practice of collect belittled animals from the local schoolchildren as taunt for his snakes and his friend gets get hitched with to a stripper thus disconcert his rite wednesday night band concert he become on the rampage in the process creating a memorable pileup of clunkers beneath the drop off where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate person owners one comic game you can play while watching snakes is to place play on which cars will land the farthest down the cliffall in all very cheap and exploitatory but will really be a lot of sport for fans of these kinds of movies
1,this is a film that has to be taken in context along it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the wish sort of people seeing indium this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you increase shouldnt go in expecting along blade runner the information technology films budget doesnt stretch quite that blue runner far principally and its a far more ellas zany rideessentially the film to a greater extent is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where terminated its world health organization illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or refinement alive and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one merely can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there stir because of over population increased life spans and so foul forth interestingly the dialogue in foul rather the give notice film is mainly cantonese whilst symmetric sho and riki who play their doctrine parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few atomic number speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with pic it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to check be offensive alir said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all interchangeable artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he indium merely calls back philosophies angstrom of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good accept hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very angstrom nice on the eyes with symmetrical check shots a angstrom good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare beryllium in hollywood these days associate in nursing basically theres side a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it past for being a bit wish cheesy but isnt that part of the charm
0,like most i rented this after i heard the universal praise and despite countless bizarre unexplainable moments along the way i was very interested and entertained through minutes of the film then the two women went to the performance late at night the rest of movie which is another minutes by the way is even weirder than the first part and completely contradict and dump on what i had already seen then the movie abruptly endsbaffled i wandered over to my computer to see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened nothing made sense and im a pretty clever guy none of these other user comments made sense even when they say spoilers i still have no idea what theyre saying someones dream not real then whats the point of a hour minute movie if its not real or is it real im forced to make a choice eithera the movie is a work of genius on a mensa level and im simply too stupid to understand itb the movie is weird for weirds sake and just doesnt make sense everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they get iti choose b screw you guys im going home
1,i remember this film from many years ago certainly the best film on the subject in my experience the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a billboard time testifies to its impact it is becharm difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier but they surely were nonetheless very powerfulthis subject continues to fascinate us even with record the passing of years and it was most effectively treated here with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticismi wish it right would be useable be roadblock in effect shown on tv at least once or at least be available on tape or agone dvd or is it is some art film archive hoarding a copy of videodisc it
0,when i watched this take up crap it reminded me opine of the the title of the movie fire which is where this garbage belongs in a fire i dont even know what to say blasted the acting blew the fire looked really fake andy the chicks arent exactly supermodels and sound off pic lastly i dont know what you people are complaining i spoilt own this damn movie yeah happy birthday to me well crack cocaine i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind and to make things worse i have the whole set on dvd firevolcanoearthquakeavalanche all im missing is the awesome tornado movie which i pic hear sucks ballswell wholly until my next crap movie kvetch peace

1,bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesnt get any better than this zadoras overacting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such dont miss ray liottas debut film line looks like a penis
1,this liked the first out of slow ive given any movie what made this the ie good for me constant smart that isnt any that parts great acting action writing i also finally the filming style where movie shakiness and different angles just made it feel there you are a part of the scene two i get to see an action movie theres doesnt try to please all sectors of the public so like no of romancei liked the first is bourne movies but i loved this onewarning after watching this movie you will be full forced adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car
1,i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ago i watched it for what it was a collection of music videos its not a movie it doesnt have a plot nor a central storyline its a rather artistic anthology of mostly longform videos all of them rather smartly or creatively done michael jackson may be considered a freak these days but after all this was the man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set trends with billie jean and beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects live performance footage and even selfparody the badder sequence and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there this video came out just a tad before he became a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the choreographed section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point
0,oh my god i was so expecting something more sprightliness entertaining than this when geezerhood i downloaded this movie seeing as convinced was one of my fave years for movies ever but it sucked the plot although unretentive id pic hesitate to call it that is about repugnance some dumb elephant it slowly makes its way onto some platform approximately and gets electrocuted to information technology death lame even for a short film the plot was too thin to create keep my attention pitiful edison is like the worst director ever plus the forgetful elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending wow that wasnt predictable at all sarcasmthe picture quality is horrible too posteriority you can barely tell whats going on most of the time the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other sorry unscary horror flicks this didnt spawn eleven sequels subsequence other than that this is a complete waste of money and minute of your life youll never get back

1,its not sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a great career but taken as a whole because there are no famous personalities the film seems more realistic than some high budget well cast filmsa film made for a few bucks that is worthy of watching should give hope to all those would be film makers and wantabee actorsthe problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time tv was taking over the revenues of the film industry and this film could have easily been shown on tv in all the fare on tv would qualify for a g rating the film industry began to make more adult films that could not be shown on tv during the days when tv wouldnt dare show the sex and skin of todays commercials
0,im actually watching this film as i write this if the following comments prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then be it i am still thinking as im presently viewing that film to put it mildly is very very overrated again looks like a really really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources and who didnt pay that attention to dont want to on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but well i just get it rememeber i fully admit that maybe its me thats the here not the film maker for not getting this piece of imaginative genius i rented this a whim because the reviews were outstanding sheesh

0,ivan the terrible is more a filmed stage play than a bigscreenopus citizen kane a similar work in many ways is quite the opposite in the way we come to expect such fare in that it has lots of location shooting for exampleacting is meant to convey a characters motivations and thinking to the audience if it succeeds in making you understand the character what does it matter how it was done and considering the low amount of action how else is one to express events that influence the story and consequently the characters machinations and decisions other than exaggerated movementsas well theres a historical level why the acting style should not surprise the rise of totalitarian regimes in germany and ussr forced filmmakers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew how as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed cinemas evolution and techniques they only used what they knewthe nazis control of government in germany destroyed the great german film industry of the s due to their total control over that film industry and propaganda films can only entertain german troops so much hence the need for popular german silent films of the s for example so a lot of ivan the terrible films techniques would have been derived from such captured german films supplied to the film crew as mentioned in other commentsthere was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found overhyped it is by no means a bad cinematic experience and definitely not amongst the worse films ever the acting is fine and part of the cinematography excellent even by todays standards more below definitely not a popcorn flick one cant leave their brain outside this ones door dated perhaps and very symbolic only worth watching on the big screen if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these films chiefly bw experience it all depends upon what expectations one walks in withwarning spoilers do not read the following comments in case they influence your personal view of the filmsand if one does not mind the obvious communist propaganda as opposed to capitalist propaganda for ivan is how stalin saw himself obvious in his influence on the films direction see other comments and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the us perspective will definitely understand this maybe ivan was an earlier incarnation of stalin or maybe not this is more a diatribe on stalin and his motivations decisions loneliness promotions of lackeys etc using the persona of ivan than any true historical record of ivan also note the obvious use of particular colours in the sequel red for the ussr in the banquet scene and perhaps blue for the usa during certain shots when the usurper wears the crownbut it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows or the exterior shot of the populace coming to beg ivans return to moscow
0,i read about this film online and after seeing the generally it has received viewing the trailer i decided check it out for myself what a disappointment it starts out well enough the opening scene was actually pretty tense but from its all downhill i see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie but by doing so they took the enjoyment out of watching it choices combined with the csi editing music and montage lack of suspense scares or humor really drag this film down theres too much and to many subtle clues when the first arrives early you already know how the movie going end i gave the movie stars because i think the cast a good other than that i cant recommend this movie
1,directed by govind nihalani this is definite cop film of indian cinema may be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force politics with no holds barred how it effects on a young cop a man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father agreed that we grew up watching lot of good copbad cop hindi films but this is different todays generation which grown up watching dark realistic films like isatya company may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making the film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didnt pay much attention to such kind of cinema yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class mass audience when it released for om puri its first breakthrough in mainstream hindi cinema he delivered a class performance as inspector velankar its more than cop character he internalized a lot which is something original in acting watch his scenes with his father whom he hates smita whom he loves smita patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level my god what a natural expressions she carried shafi inamdar was truly a discovery for me hes a brilliant character actor if given a chance here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even om the movie is also a debut of a promising villain on indian screen sadashiv amrapurkar as rama shetty its another story that he didnt get such a meaty role almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of dharmendras b grade action films watch the scene where om st time becomes a rebel for his father played by amrish puri next both are sharing wine together how inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love hate for each other two faces of indian police force masculinity impotency and in between lies half truth ardh satyakudos to nihalanis touch the film won national awards as best hindi feature film best actor om puri filmfare awards in best film best director best supporting actor categories recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious hindi filmsratings
0,i liked this show i think it was nothing with wrong with it only that spidey dont punch anyone but only for that the show doesnt suck some people only think this show is bad because of that the story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like xmen the punisher daredevil and iron man to bad sandman never appear but i kinda like it best spidey show ever my favorite episodes are turning point spider wars the hobgoblin the alien costume mutant agendabut there are some episodes that was really really bad like rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch and i dont like morbius and hydro man first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i dont like vampires and it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in season of course i have to mentioned hydro man he was terrible i rather see sandman his last appearance was so terrible and i dont like spidey as the manspiderbut i guess everything than this was bad
0,be with me is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie just leave it running in the backcloth chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some level itll end alas as i watched it alone and so i felt like i almost watched the worlds worst recollective and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time i just about wield to keep my eye open as the end deferred payment rolled and i then wield just a a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a thank you to the movies sponsors which included asia peaceable breweries aha methought how surprising is that have all the stab of tiger beer interlard throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie interim dialogue spurts between individuals with occasional stabs at depth but all too usually nothing of any particular advancement to the movies overall storey is enjoin or witnessed its as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later level and youd genuinely have neglect nothing which would have been an unmissable contingency or share of its plot as far as the movies overall progression was concerned thus the ultimate wallpaper moviewell i wonderment what movie were those who positively retrospect this one watching i wonderment and keep to wonderment it sure enough couldnt have been this arty to the level of artless singaporean excuse for a cameras rolling allegedly be with me is suppose to be thread around the theme of do it tragedy and buyback but all i witnessed was tedium a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages and the only buyback was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended what a wistful waste of time it ended up being it was also enjoin that the fiber in this movie were fictitious except for theresa chan who is a singular woman who has exult over adversities well no discourtesy to ms chan but have that she was such a fantastic amazing fictitious character why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other fiber without the most thin attempt to connect their survive together in time it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the deferred payment rolling kind of than tying in the fates of all fiber i genuinely felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and plain fell between stools as far as any viewer engagement could be concernedi am generally an arthouse movie fan and dont usually object to tardily pace of which here there is no shortage believe you me i detest such movies as transformers fight club but take eg eric rohmer as a groovy film maker so i hope that frame my criticism into some perspective nonetheless there was no redeemable feature film whatsoever in the total movies innovation and delivery which could prevent ones eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of be with me dripped by take in this movie if you need to finger like neutralise time differently your sprightliness would be none the richer for having neglect it
1,first off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasnt meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in nonshock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoidpessimistici didnt trust anyone for about a week because i didnt want to wake up strung up and tortured
0,there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant the us version the person will get new or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful what have got the us version of this show is everything reality tv shouldnt be instead of making a few improvements a which the could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt i do not know if this show is trying to show a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard you will receive the rather vulgar product that takes place particularly by sears is also uncalled for rsther than turning one in a deprived area millionaires it would be far better to help community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perhaps a place where diy and power tools can borrowed and returned along with materials so that can should they want to giving it to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the who still live in the same run down houses
1,dont know what film or version jeff saw but this entire film was awesome not just poitier and going the story was riveting suspenseful and engaging and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory as a rule they did not patrol but exercised warrants on criminals only i did find it odd that corby didnt seem to have any indian friends i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange even as corby returned to his people his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless
1,adapting his novel cabal for the screen author screenwriter director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story outr horror and craig sheffer plays boone a young man becomes suspected a serial killer the cops gun him in front of midian on surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society when they lay claim to boone and make him one of their own repercussions for everybody including boones sweet girlfriend the very cute anne bobby and dubious psychiatrist a most enjoyable cronenbergnightbreed displays kind of wild and twisted imagination that i dont see in movies all that often one thing ralph mcquarrie an hand at conceptual art having worked on such films the initial three wars entries barker to create excellent for nightbreed starting right away with the opening sequence the visual and makeup effects are elaborate and production design and cinematography quite impressive and crew do a job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take and of course theres the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a persons actionsgreat supporting performances add to fun oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas bad doctor while charles haid is fine lovetohatehim type of antagonist a rather nasty police captain doug pinhead bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup the weary lylesberg is solid as a rock hugh is great fun as narcisse as catherine chevalier as rachel an added bonus she her breasts one sequence simon bamford who played the the first two hellraiser pictures turns up here as well theres even a cool cameo by and s star john agardanny elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores barker leads us through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasnt seen it i a hearty recommendation
0,although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of its intrigue i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these charactersthis won first place at cannes in which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogetherthis is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once its over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like this film at every turn
1,i was quite to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ago i watched for what it a collection of videos its not a movie it doesnt have plot nor a central storyline its rather artistic anthology of mostly longform videos all rather smartly or creatively done michael jackson may be considered a freak these days but after all this was the who gave us thriller considered by to be the greatest video of all and trends with billie jean and beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects live footage and even selfparody the badder sequence and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there this came out just tad before he became a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the choreographed section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that
1,if perfect like deep purple you will enjoy in this excellent movie to stephen rea in main concerts the and is about s most famous rock group back there in the strange fruits story still decided to play the again but of course there is going with be lots of problem during theirs role jimmy nail and bill nighy are great and song together flame they burns is you you have to watch it
0,wish as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about information technology the worst trash film ever made be let me see how many different words i can use to describe it boring unbearable laughable lousy stupid horriblei could go on with such descriptions but you oil production probably get the pointi would have given this a if possiblebad rotten acting bad directing bad production bad plotthis was made in and it looks more like very low budget boring plot horrible acting really bad wish special effects etci pic rarely ever see go for a scifi film frightful i absolutely think is this bad i mean this is pure garbage it has nothing going for it check either as atomic number far as a bmovie this is the very entirely bottom second of the loti think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for minutes junk like this gives good lowbudget b atomic number movies a bad name this makes ed wood movies look goodthe thing about watching directtovideo information technology movies is just when accept you think youve seen the worst you see something even worsedj perry is a horrible actor wholly and has no individual characteristics that make him report stand outavoid this waste at all costs oh the humanity
0,this film is just as bad as the birdman of alcatraz i do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures moreover it disturbs me when well respected revered actors like alan alda and burt lancaster play such roles because their status tends to lend credibility to the directors intent to elevate the films subject a societal outcasti was in junior high school during the last years of caryl chessmans life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news i remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and chessman was the victimget a grip people read the history chessman was a criminal and sexual predator he drove around the la streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle he stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest then abducted and raped the women rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and humiliationchessman got exactly what he deserved it just took a decade too long no sympathy for the devil here
1,way totally different with loads of understatement leave and world health organization black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it this movie creates its own universe wholly and is fascinating in every way what it is about estrangement i believe probably up to the viewer but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades dont know if im right but this movie leave get really got to me see it i really hope proficient the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda beryllium to a greater extent weird style and i information technology forgot the casting here i superb with hurl trond fausa aurvg being perfect human in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing non and why entirely the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him bothersome all the approximately others do as they are told and pretend to be happy this movie is a good and humourous humorous comment on life in
0,when i first heard about this movie i thirstily went out to rent it believing erroneously that it was single of those sobaditsfun movies and that i was in for a plow i was wrongfor starters the step is torturously mindnumbingly slow the step doesnt even begin to find fault up until the last minutes of the movie the plat was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing for those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwisetry tike play rather

0,them like animated moving i enjoy the nick fare pretty much including hey arnold enough shows just tv show to the big a isnt easy and this a didnt feel big but it was more like screen long episode of the show and it just didnt move the that well judging by the behavior of along kids we had with us it didnt score that well with i either
0,this comedy is really not funny it a stereotypes that plays so much on romance it makes no impact a its caper film so derivative yes even back then with has hard performers cast is more no than that its no starred say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would wants to robert montgomery the wife of a businessman it adequate time for anything but work could have been any number of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known is film peopled by snapthe mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real generic a impressionits knockoff and who have that
0,it was are disjointed it seemed to jump from place you place and the thief was obvious it was a poor mans not to mention high school less than zero i would is on this movie as it has terrible little to add so pass exactly so left unresolved and thats okay very the fact that it because around to the point im to wonder whats issues going on many but the voiceover is needed jumps the movie doesnt work on its own avoid this movie and watch something else about rich are angst where sure there teen plenty of others to watch dont waste your time on this
0,the fbi story was warner bros minute epic tribute to the famous investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn did have colour cinematography joseph biroc and a helpful score by the musical magician max steinerthe charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all through the of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty stewart as relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it to like a mini instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the crime gamut from such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles has the thankless role of being long but devoted wife he is surrounded a cast of minor players throughout you find half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a entrance as a a police chief or whatever nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs film does however to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the and we are treated to a inside headquarters which the gigantic section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their choresanother for movie is max steiners remarkable score over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the was one of five scores the composer wrote which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the romcom cash mccall daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young love which was become a major hit tune for better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland adams who has up a plane with people on board including his mother is being handcuffed turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for next month or so after that you send it to hell wow
1,the movie is a in truth well piddle one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can secernate that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great take in and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to topographic point this movie under one label its not in truth a dramatic event its not in truth a thriller and its not in truth a funniness alternatively its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the find of cinema and feature of speech many different ingredient from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of decelerate and boring in region the esthetic style of take tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite round eyed one and its more as if the movie bank exclusively on its style and overall ambience created by the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just forestall it from being a true absolute mustsee in region the movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the see speak too a lot for itself it just feels a bit overdone in region though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit feature of speech some great camerawork and some unequaled storytelling which make this an master copy as well as a great film to take in
1,roman polanski for considered feeling one of in most important directors of our time sharing the the behind classics such as rosemarys on and chinatown probably what makes polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the cage that while the and capable cinematography creating commercially attractive films in as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making that movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the flaw first them of those movies a because story about the and obsession that is the in madness works and one among paranoia best horror own ever donepolanski himself plays telkovsky bizarre young man looking for an apartment in france when interested finally finds one he discovers the it is empty horrorsuspense the previous tenant simone choule attempted like kill herself by to out of the window after simone in of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her not the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants dies the buildingwhile as the same claustrophobic feeling of his jumping apartmentthemed films bizarre rosemarys the this film focuses on the repulsion conspiracy that may and may not be entirely his trelkovskys head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has baby his mind is the is obsession he has with among previous tenanttrelkovskys descend into darkness has portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first life performance seems odd and wooden slowly probably finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted lowkey way as a simpleton with almost no his who traps roman works in maddening subworld that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life not the people this the building creating gradually characters attractiveif are very important a that success of the filmalso the beautiful is polanski employs such the film boring to increase mind feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as fact for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the as of confusion and best are of a supernatural that beauty makes one both frightening or that a flaw is to be found in the film mimics that it is definitely a bit slow at is this may sound like a turnoff but in fact he slow pace of the a in perfectly as it is trelkovskys movies helps life and how memorable he enters beginning different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely to an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it of however more than a tenant it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking plot other this onewhile baby tenant may to be for everyone those he the psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of himself polanksis masterpieces
1,better than the typical madefortv movie invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting urich lucci cassidy mccarthy premurphy brown joe regalbuto soleil moonfrye and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy maudlin denoument

0,oh boy films like this really bother me if this movie supposed to close to truth then i assume rommel hitler for a time before wwii started in the movie rommel mentions how hitler had changed from before well i cant imagine that rommel wouldnt known about government policies so rommel must share some guilt for the german atrocities with that in mind i have a with a movie that makes rommels life at the end a tragic one he his choices and we have to feel bad for him i cant do it i also cant buy the theory that if more competent generals were allowed to fight the war allies would have had more trouble winning it more competent people were in charge wwii may never have started in the first place from a movie watching aspect the film jumps from place to and the time like a with name actors playing the historical roles g carroll has a couple good scenes with james and i the fact that spoke without the ridiculous accents but other than that not very essential
0,oh my deity i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i download this movie catch as was one of my fave years for movies eer but it sucked the plot although id hesitate to call it that is about some dumb elephant it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets electrocute to dying lame even for a unawares film the plot was too thin to observe my attention edison is wish the worst director eer plus the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the finish wow that wasnt predictable at all sarcasmthe envision quality is frightful too you can barely tell whats going on most of the time the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other unscary horror flicks this didnt breed eleven continuation other than that this is a complete waste of money and minute of your life youll never receive back

1,not all but most of this is buster being for dead dan a notorious there really is no story a series of adventures to show busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a buster is interested in who chases him latter scenes were i thought a lot clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its buster his slapstick best or near and so it serves its purpose to entertain think years after film was made there are like me still and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool

1,the italian job requires daylight hours and eastern samoa no experience is required this is a great matinee picture show and a good afternoon at the movies the plot is good but the merely actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires amusement no thought process its be car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy played by edward norton for norton it seems he is limn content to portray the exact same astatine characters as in his previous so films such as the score mark wahlberg and pic charlize theron deserve better scripts warning if youve seen the trailer then you have seen mental object the movie if youre pauperism looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job

0,the trouble with this film comparable so many other celluloid that fail is the scriptthe book is so unfocussed it flounders about all over the place what is the report here okay its a biopic but i think everyone will gibe there is no way that an integral life can be condense into or so minutes some pick and editing is postulate but this book just didnt select or edit enough it didnt render hoffmans life down to one or definable pivotal moments or subject that the interview could discover with and through them get the heavy picture of the whole manthe movie wanders from being a straight plodding troubled genius biopic to semidocumocumentary employ new shots cook up to match archive footage to fill in true life sob chronicle movie of the week the whole im bringing up a son who doesnt know im his dad shtick to political conspiracy possibility movie etc etc it just never shuffle its mind up what it wants to be and the halfhearted citizen kane comparable narrative body structure reporter interviewing people from hoffmans past is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and soft than it starts outthe movie is full phase of the moon of moments and incident that contribute nothing to the report and could well have been cut to leave room to expatiate something more important the whole scene in the shrink office after vincent donofrio pounds the window screaming im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im acting im acting im acting could have easily been cut all that happens is the psychiatrist says you have bipolar disorder heres some lithium and the woman in his life read we could check you weekends more oftentimes and bang thats it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high school and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman call god pointless tells us nothing about anything until now when it comes to a pivotally important mo comparable the drugs bust the film pretend is so hurried the situation just comes out of left field and doesnt induce any sense to the interview suddenly hes dealing in heroin where did this semen from why what is going on here i being a middleaged leftie would estimate i am sitting well within the target interview for this movie but even i got fertilize up with the portrayal of the mankind the pigs the hair etc as brutal besuited unthinking hippiehating androids it may have been comparable that in s america i dont know i wasnt there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemichaving said all that vincent donofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything even translate a bus timetable though she just wasnt proper for this take off
0,this moving picture supposedly a thriller had about subplots that developed simultaneously to climax at the stop but it ended up more as a yawnthe writing was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the fictitious character were dull george clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym matt damon overplay it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompterthe worst part of this moving picture was that it was carefully craft to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business fossil oil and the middleeast i have construe documentary provide more inflammation watch it only if theres absolutely nothing else to do
1,now this show looks like most of the other shows of its type from the mid s but the only thing is about this one is that its different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i cant understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since up to datemy hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesnt hurt to dream doesnt itanyway i would recommend if you hadnt seen it to find the dvd of all episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great
0,shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of off a character brings sense gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters of whom dieok if you cant be to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any can at least make reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with side really knowing they are fighting each other they each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbfine fine there no character development and plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting least they fighting in cool action scenes right again no fact many of fights arent even fights all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in opinion im talking about things like lalala walking and i neck gets slashed the end that character not even halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it
1,this moving picture is composite and interest in so many ways it is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects wind up and love womens emotional abuse of man work force physical abuse of women sexual child abuse novel approach to religion in real life and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues musici promise you that if you sit through the number one minutes you will find the link up in and bettering of all the characters and the closing will be more pleasant than you can expect music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliantand the videodisc has some great features including samuel jacksons background of encyclopaedism to play guitar and feel the bluesthis moving picture is not for children and i even out caution parents of teenagers

1,as information technology one eastern samoa other accept imdb reviewer has considerably remarked this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably better as it goes along yes it is released tuck by roger corman and yes it goes operating theater over some of the same taradiddle watcher thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors little such as fatal attraction and poison ivy however the on juxtapositioning of the wifes career as a rising blues singer against the husbands gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical void or go for hole conserve while shes away along with the clever use of minimal effects first and figure settings is nicely done utilizing a very small number of locations and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffering thought from a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways to a greater extent of the more fully realized and forlornness more recent scenario namely the french film swimming pool which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set be up against amanda maintains its suspense with angstrom a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations early but accomplishes this as well or temptation better as quandary other films in advantageously this genre the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past again very go for freudian is also very unique in this genre and interesting i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amandas plight this aspect of the story elicits the cast is excellent i think

0,i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent bgrade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess

1,first of all i need to say lusitanian that im portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably eer one each year or even noneand the deeds reason is the unsloped almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever lusitanian made however in the last decade form it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the s when leo da estrela e costa do castelo were game among the worlds best of their time with movies like pulsao zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in commonthis one angstrom is also good not of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy in fact its officially a drama a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous back characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel be to the caribbean just to get laid the plot works and can surprise us a few times the actors are fine the locations regular as the angstrom score but the upright truth is that it all make lay sense then we pic can count it as a nice effort for back the national cinema trueness that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenixif indium you want to watch verity a portuguese movie surely you can deed of conveyance take better option but it stills one to be first measured

1,it was a fun film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and the humour do work i must admit that you dont have to see it in a theater it will do very well on a small tvset tip see it with some close friends

0,there i read about this film online and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received and merely viewing the trailer i decided to check it out for myself what a disappointment it starts out well enough the opening strain scene was actually pretty tense but from there its all downhill i can see that the curtain raising filmmakers were extinct trying to do something different with this movie but by doing so they took all the angstrom enjoyment out of watching want it those choices combined with the get along csi editing use of music and montage lack of suspense scares or humor really drag this film down theres too much foreshadowing pernicious and to many subtle pernicious clues accept so when the first twist arrives early on you already know how the movie merely is going to end i gave the movie three pic stars because i think the cast did a good job other than that i cant recommend this movie
1,sometimes is half worth watching happen an is this cheesy it is great to see a young back astin and this ends and being quite an entertaining and humorous action although i watched it many times when i was young and now still enjoy it when i pop movie old vhs into the machine go the to own a copy so sit sean with this movie let reality i for a little while and you will be able to have a few good laughs up it enjoyable hour and a one
1,this a rip roaring western sandwich and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every levelhowever if your after the lawful facts about such legends as hickcockcody and calamity jane then look elsewhere as john ford suggested this is the west when the sojourner truth becomes legend print the legendthe account moves with a break pace and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this moviethe sharp eye amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an red indian scout also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior he actually married one of cecil b demille girl in real lifeindeed its quinns character reference who informs cooper of the massacre of george armstrong custer recite in heartbeat back the finale is well through and when the credits flap it fuses the american west with american historyso please take time out to watch this classic western sandwich
0,as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about the worst film ever made let me catch how many different words i can use to describe it boring unbearable laughable dirty stupid horriblei could proceed on with such descriptions but you probably father the pointi would have given this a if possiblebad acting badness directing badness production badness plotthis was made in and it looks more like very low budget boring patch horrible acting genuinely badness especial effects etci rarely ever catch a scifi film i perfectly think is this badness i mean this is unadulterated garbage it has nothing function for it either as far as a bmovie this is the very seat of the loti think i would be more entertained by staring at a clean piece of paper for minutes junk like this gives full lowbudget b movies a badness name this pass water ed wood movies look goodthe thing about watching directtovideo movies is just when you think youve seen the worst you catch something even worsedj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual device characteristic that cause him bandstand outavoid this waste at all price oh the humanity
0,i gave this movie a chance only because it had very check good reviews after seeing the trailer i thought what an unfunny movie full of clichs but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often dont portray the movie very check well what a waste of time advantageously the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending hours watching it i couldnt recall angstrom one single line that made me laugh the funniest flavour parts of the movie were the csi leave parodies but that also is pretty pass train i couldnt relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be metre together because i pic found them utterly stupid the plot is extremely predictable and pudden head inconclusive unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high information technology school information technology or feel that way mentally
1,ah classic comedy at the point in the movie funniness where brains get messed together a two minute scene joseph campbell with bruce campbell beating himself up partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a lev ivanov whole moviefor years and years bruce campbell knows what kind of movies we want out sir david bruce of him we wholly want to see weird movies joseph campbell like bubba ho wish tep we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies and eldritch we title of respect want to see along man with indium the screaming brain with the title alone one knows that its going to border that eldritch completely silly type of movie like army of darkness only with more silly and less monstersthe idea of the movie is simple bruce sees doctor doctor has new coincidently idea bruce gets bad things happen get matter to him on way to see doctor coincidentally its the thing the give notice doctor wanted vista to matter show him that saves him hilarity ensueswith the addition of ted raimi as a weird russian guy and journeyman stacy keach as dr ivan ivanovich angstrom ivanov its funny that does this movie complete funny never a point of scaryif you like the silly bruce campbell youll like this then again why would neer you be watching this if you didnt like capture bruce campbell
1,this film is an classic for camp that is why it was an elvira and mst classic everyone knows the scientist keeps his girlfriends head alive in lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town tries to find her a body by checking out chicks finally finds a real hourglass body with a scarfaced chicks head on the severed head makes friends the failed experiment in the closet and the comes out of the and off the assistants remaining good arm his other is not right from a scientists earlier failure and the place burns downthe movie scared us as kids that my friend go into his basement for a after seeing it as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number only one of those scary movies was really good the the hauntingi had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle the scientist looks for the bodies complete with porno sound track scares hell out of innocent children while the ridiculous aspects make it prime for watching talking and laughing i could watch this film tonight and it while rather go to the dentist than watch chicago is the most i can give it because its entertainment value is mere luck the film as cinema is a disaster

0,pretty visuals and of fights make not good movie is precisely what happened herefirst off let me admit i am yet to play ffvii i intend to order it soon however i did do research to familiarise myself with the characters and the story however not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this and children demands that knowledge of ffvii is requiredin of visuals i cant say there is too much thats it in final fantasy the spirits within and apart better movement cant say theyve done lots of superdaring stuff with thisthe fight scenes well they a of fun still how could we ever doubt the result of any this was boringly classic there were three fights with the bad guys following the standard procedure the cloud gets smashed then he almost there and gets smashed then finally the reason say it was boringly classic was that it is used a deal but in this case is poorly executed ill touch that laterthe english dub fine me i didnt watch it in japanese so shant judge the japanese dub but only the english one ill say this ive heard plenty of better ones even in my limited repertoireand now the plot ummm what plot let me be frank this movie is nought but a fan service a chance to the ffvii characters on big with lovely eye candy as i said earlier the fights seem to just happen for no reason the opening fight is never explained seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty cloud sits around moping for the entire film and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameoreally ffvii was an ensemble piece advent children is anything but if theyd give everyone some significant story role star trek first contact proved it was i might add then this could have been a lot better naturally that would have changed the plot too which lets be honest is almost set to be better than the one we gotcharacters also generally either unused or virtually forgotten the members of avalanche thats the group cloud worked with in ffvii for those who dont know get in the case of valentine and some get even hell the bad guys get more lines than these guys and that is pretty music well i dont care if nobuo uematsu is god himself he botched film big time one winged angel was the only decent otherwise he couldnt decide whether to be epic and orchestral or fun with electric guitar when he switched from one to the other you felt it as though hed a to your headand that on whether movie was epic or fun it tried to be both and failed honestly you cant please everyone and do everything the movie also tried to be deep you can go and deep or fun and deep but all three is too much but failed here too the last scene which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony was thrown in there for what like the sake of it you dont need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there that scene just didnt belong in the film nor did aeriths frequent appearances shes dead jimgiven just how fantastic ive heard final fantasy vii movie is short a gigantic disappointment because of the beautiful visuals i give a out of

0,that a lot of horror films are based the premise that one or more of the central characters something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have better than they did and have screamed a lot less while doing you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camerawork my yearold grandmother wields a camcorder with results extremely poor sound and plotnarrative then this is film also that you enjoy the following women screaming for no women whining for no reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah i believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last yeah she wanted to talk about some date she asked one what come she didnt me as in our friend is chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons i have a problem with the fact that she didnt tell me she was going on a dateokay so the budget is that doesnt mean you have make it look it cost half the budget the iscore is interesting since all with the exception of one tracks have been written and performed by the writersdirectors of the film itself in it would appear that the has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death band from swedenthe worrying thing of all in the entire film is the which leaves us with possibility for a sequel

0,couldnt more than likely a good important you to have figured out yourselves yeah its really weird that rented it at a they for the hed it had absolutely no description of the movie on the of of the box only a list of the got movie had songs in into but after that i he a dikens of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with night back the demons but you know theyre basically the same of he tv i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in other garage that black gym guy was hilarious the way had screamed all the time even when screaming wasnt really necessary reason let out a listen up now that the door with cars and so theyd run but towards on it other cars cars then the bands balls and the by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was the the part block running caught my attention was the end with the crash the the building with outside guys i blockbuster girl didnt want to come over just what significant aspect thing the movie did that give us what was it why this it there why did the that part with a guy breaking the tvs in nothing studio i saw that there was a zombie kinda head shafted screen but he was kinda far away i mean he could have spoilers turned the parts off yes was movie was shot on a whim and yes i hated it really day
0,as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly arent so many that i want to discourage filmmakers from a literary genre thats woefully underexploited still i must honestly say that loves abiding delight is a typically humbled budget humbled florida key selfconsciously christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre im being genial and the editing atrocious as a idiot box movie it might have been more or less above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be sought after living trying guys youve got to have a movie about about rattling christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or speed of light s lewis for some intake
0,i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel violated i had read the reviews and heard the warnings and i thought i was prepared for anything at best i thought a faithful if misguided attempt at an original adaptation at worst a sogooditsbad plan for the new millennium so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk i joked to my friends prepare for the worst movie ever made oh cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film the special effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx the acting is terrible the accents are worse than terrible one artillery mans accent seems to take us on a tour of the british isles from scotland to wales via northern ireland the dialogue is stilted the editing is nonexistent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words really cannot describe how bad this movie is from the union flag flying from the horribly cgid thunderchild the royal navy flies the white ensign not the union flag to the woodworm ridden acting this is quite simply a crime against film making when you consider some of the literallyzerobudget fan films that are available on the net the star wars short troops for example the whole were enthusiastic amateurs argument goes right out of the window and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website this film had an figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the problem is that hines co tried to make a film of the book rather than turn the book into a film if that makes any sense characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words ironically enough the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers the exsoft porn actress my advice pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesnt screw up and go watch the spielberg version it may not be true to the text of the book but i can say this as a lifelong hg wells fan and englishman as well speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i want them back
0,this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school early high school age kids maybe to them its funny they may possibly even see something scary in it to me the acting is poor and plot is poor theres just not much value at all for the adult viewer i saw this film as weak and boring at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds they dont seem to have any substance other than the look at times i wasnt sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again this movie just wasnt good for me
0,i was over the of films of burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from i first it cable in remember dialogue from tatum oneal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burtons character looking so hopelessly lost and remembering how his didnt translate to in short i remember circle two because it was so phenomenally awfulthis movie came out at a time when america was going through rather disturbing period of with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality recall the blue lagoon and brooke shields annoyances lipstick beau pere and films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults as teenager during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the s s made for a subconsciously unsettling in which to figure it all out so speakcircle of two not execrably or needlessly blue lagoon in fact it tackles the question of between the young and the old a failed way but honestly is one of those films you will never see you didnt see it on its first run because was so truly awful no one would to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again
0,i dont know what the oscar voters saw in this associate in nursing dishonor movie but they must argot of seen some pretty hard spoilt stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar all i know pic is that fortunately there was gene crataegus laevigata be kelly to play in it taradiddle or this would have been twice as bad as i fairly believe it is first of all i dont think leslie caron was really fit to play such in that respect a role she isnt that talented she isnt a great dancer and eastern samoa shes not good looking at all professional dancer its a shame that one actor thence information technology or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing academy award in it because if leslie caron looking at hadnt been in this it upright might have made a terrific movie angstrom the story spiel was intelligent the directing wasnt bad and as i said gene kelly was pretty good now im not saying all associate in nursing this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her im just saying it because i think thats what the worse part of the movie is shes probably a good actress but i cant tell because i havent seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in factor an american in paris so if you want to see it go ahead but im telling you youre information technology way better off watching singin in the rain

1,welli wouldnt deficiency to lecture anybody but i do feel the urge to rules of order some things i consider important about this beautiful film i saw it for the starting time meter in i was and then one more meter a year later that was it the rest of it was the pink l p of elton johns soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart how deep a calendar week ago my cousin gave me a vhs copy as a present no dvd yet boywas i surprise poets have always sustained that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty love graven image idealist pursuits stay with you forever since they occur mostly at the spirit level no intellect yet they define your souls contours like a sculptor would do with a stone if sometimes we didnt tend to forget how rightfulness they are maybe we would do better in understanding the meaning of every min of every decision of every call on point of our lives so i confess i feel nostalgia but the fascinating component of this is watching the film again and through this trip back in meter enriching that understanding of why we people from the s uprise up as we did the life of those times is all here a genesis created far from the official world of run through and economical success fix love not war the beautiful pop ballad the poetry of the lyrics a totally romantic perspective of adolescent insurrection with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrap in tender and chaste love these two lonely spirits still full of childhood innocence growing together as they take common commitment and call on into adults i showed the film to a radical of civilize youngsters and they abounded with such simplistic and cynical gossip regarding it as nave and foolish jest at be serious movie theater is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotion but diachronic moments and this is exactly what friends does in a consummate way it reflects an idyllic idea of insurrection and unexampled beginning we all dreamt about when we were im now a musician and i feel some of us artists for that matter still dream about it how else could we endure thats friends thats blood brother sun baby moon around thats hair those were the times still alien to aids alien to explicit and vulgar texts in pop song with no melody to pornography presented as sexuality to this barbaric unexampled world rules of order growing after sept atomic number what a heart warming experience to see paul and michelle again timidly and tenderly exploring the unexampled fantasies of their romantic world what a trip back to the very burden of our spirit to paris to elton john at his best to that urban scenario wall by one hundred five citrons and the vw beetles what a fresh air from the peaceful cottage in camargue wall by fishing ponds and savage horses they made us who we are as did serrat in spain brel in anatole france peter paul and madonna joan baez luther king the beatles the early bee g force belafontes spirituals indira nehru gandhi the gospel of zen people still hoping stick this picture start with innocence and grow from there youll find out what its all about and from there youll have a hearty and more truthful foundation some ideals to look for in life a way to hold personal and world affair we need so a lot of this now give yourselves the chance and maybe someday the meter of cynics will end i have an extra vhs copysantiago zuleta bogot republic of colombia

1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score out of
0,thought i just might get a few laughs from this long drawn out film but was sadly disappointed this film is all about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade with out even trying to open a book or accomplish anything the film also portrayed teachers and the principal mary tyler moore mrs starklabor pains as complete idiots i know this was suppose to be a comedy but it never made me laugh and i thought the entire film was a complete waste of time however all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to make this film an enjoyable and entertaining film just plain studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go

1,this is one of my all time favoritesif the movie has a defect its that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesnt so much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and pertinacious a yield as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewers imaginationmoroders languorous synthpop suit the action to a golf tee like the chorus line in a greek tragedy it wails and gnash broods and tugs a constant reminder of tonys inexorable fatenot so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screenland with the unstoppable pull of a runaway prepare
1,this movie kicks ass bar none bam and his crue have out done themselves with this film since i got the dvd days ago i have watched it three times and it gets better every time i watch it i cant wait for grind to come out in theaters if its anything like haggard it will be worth the waitthanks jtcellphone

1,what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i saw this the atlanta dragoncon considering that this is my main town am very much aficionado and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this playing in morning this not a scifi nor action film of any sort let me start out saying that i am a fan of witchblade nor of eric having watched episodeshis performance in that seemed and robotic but he managed to me over in this performance i mean really win me having seen cellular i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect i keep reading about the fx of and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was more with story which i think was even goalseeing films like godzilla huge effects just really turned me off i could sleep after this thinking over and over again my head situation of an abusive is never an easy one i showed to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think constantly would highly recommend
0,this moving picture show started out as a quite decentlooking film but it neer really kicked off instead it became predictable and level a bit light headed some setting were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combining with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to vigil but since the story was quite slow it didnt manage to hold open the matter to alive and more importantly its not scary at all its supposed to be a horror moving picture show but there wasnt a single scene that was close to frightening or level excitingto be frank the actor werent all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysoverall a watchable moving picture show but it doesnt add anything and once youve cease watching it it habit hold out long until its already forgottenthe ground i watched it was because i had say some review giving it top tons but i disagree and instead i would grade it out of if you still want some nipponese horror i would suggest you vigil juon instead
0,ive all the rave reviews here and am impressed with imagination those who loved film i say that found much to recommend it the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively but dreary beyond measure the film looks authentic enough but somethings to happen it to work and nothing much does a plot not real problem for me not much character development thematically it just slogs along flawed as it is ciminos heavens gate has moments of genuine wonder and is a film id sooner watch again for brilliant reconception of the west hbos deadwood is much superior to mccabe
1,watchers is a fun movie if its not taken too seriously the novel written by dean r koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in its own way the film has a lot of changes for the novel watchers the one difference is the main character travis in the book he was an adult and an retired delta force soldier while in the film hes a teenager watchers has its good points the film does have some gory scenes in parts im a fan of micheal ironside and it was cool to see him in this film he always does a great performance in all his films the oxcom costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film the dog einstien was impressive since it was well trainedthe film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab a dog and a monster both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them the dog finds a teenager named travis who takes him home and discovers that hes intelligent and so he names the dog einstein meanwhile the oxcom is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand soon travis learns that his not safe as the oxcom is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in its way so travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend whos being held at the hospital by the two agents they then hideout in the woods while the government agents and the oxcom are not far behindwatchers is not a great adaptation of dean r koontz novel but it is a entraining s horror flick some fans of the book may not want to watch this since its not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy s horror movies may want to check this out
0,at first of all the moving picture seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles setthe plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the moving picture get on it seemed the film director center on the wrong kind of thingsor just a heap was delete from the moving picture the characters identicalness changed for the defective within the moving picture also there seemed to be a heap of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the moving picture that didnt seem to fit the moving picture itself and the deed of conveyance no where in the moving picture does the deed of conveyance fit the moviei imagine the deed of conveyance works for the previews actors did considerably with what they hadif they had a skillful film director and writer mayhap this would have worked out skillful but it didnt so now theres a new terrible moving picture coming out this friday my opiniondont waste your time or money
1,a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies and the only form of help is affable local mr slausen chuck connors as night falls the kids get picked off in record timean odd freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of alltoolifelike mannequins making this a good update of the bodies in the wax museum genre this is an intense shock fest along the lines of the texas chain saw massacre it should then come as no surprise that tcsm art director robert a burns repeats that duty here and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy pino donaggios score is downright chilling accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von sternberg it drenches the film in oppressive atmosphereplot twists vary in level of success there was one that i saw coming a mile away and one that actually took me by surprise and i was all the more happier for it one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition the capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the endstar connors offers an engaging performance as our downhome good ol boy antagonist while the younger costars predictably cant perform at the same level although jocelyn jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damselindistress costar tanya roberts a brunette in this film is okay in support if i had one problem with this film its just that the victims are a little too stupid then again that doesnt make this much different from many horror films of the s future notable names among the credits are future directors ted nicolaou who was the editor here ron underwood who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with tremors as the assistant director and veteran makeup artist ve neill whos done many films and won three oscars sincealthough some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director david schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto recommended
1,i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a family get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an ex pat she was very antibritish she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end
0,my yearold daughter alexandra repeat thank it was very boring the i thought it for just a writesi of stuff from i dalmatians couldnt wait was the movie to end the best part was the credits at and beginning they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thought you
1,henry and robin tunny are a couple the most underrated performers the business its beyond me as to why they havent received than they have this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities areacting out lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality and if these aint odd im at a find anyone who isthe story is funny romantic dramatic complicated and tragic i hated ending but if i i wouldnt have loved the story as whole so there ya go
1,in this satire of the commercialization and lightheartedness of war john cusack contend aforementioned plays brand hauser an assassin sent to to turaqistan to take out omar sharif who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble beryllium for the former vice president of the uss own past company in beryllium addition to angstrom oecumenical this hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer a wedding for pop princess yonica hillary duff create and a nosy liberal journalist natalie marisa tomeiassessing the technical aspects the acting by the main charactersat least was good as a great deal was to be expected angstrom some of john cusacks dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often past seemed uncomfortable saying it maybe unrealistic is more accurate frailty joan put advantageously angstrom forth a great and often hilarious performance marisa tomei while ive never been a big fan of hers selfsame was more past times than suitable for duologue the role and worked well hillary duff however was pretty terrible they needed an attractive middle get eastern or russian or whatever that accent was supposed to be popstar unfortunately they line of work went for drouth with her like i said above the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points especially john cusacks dialogue not much of it mind but some the wholly story also got a bit ludicrous at points which is fine for a satire to a point irony but it took it to a whole alir new level here luckily the cusacks and tomei keep a relatively cool calm demeanor astatine throughout and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film information technology and the pic levelheadedness of the actors chief executive joshua seftel who previously had a oftentimes accept drought of real credits to his name did a fine job with a rather widespectrum eastern samoa film he handled the small million budget very well stretching it to make it appear to pic be much more seftel also operating theater managed to nicely blend the humour of the story with the painful and hardtowatch parts of information technology the real war angstrom including slaughter of civilians etc as far as the general satire goes its exaggerated look on the spiel commercializing of war is very well done especially state of war the golden palace poker ads eastern samoa on the us tanks at points it becomes a little too much but in the end it still accurate portrays what its going for an a young mel brookstype of styleoverall the film is very well made for the meager budget and its definitely worthy celluloid of a look it wont go down helium as one of the great satires of cinema aforesaid but its fairly certainly not the worst
0,i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom we my gfriend and i walked out about an hour into it what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargonsub atomic particles are thoughts by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals a drop of in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated wow what a rigorous scientific study im sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate hogwash hooey bull pucky btw it was funded by the ramtha cult the leader of which was one of the experts which were interview by the filmmakers no ulterior motives here right
1,i have waited for merely ages to comment on this programme and felt it along was about time some be justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of past mystery intrigue love and murder information technology advantageously made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is past times sublime in the part as always the existence rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully on but its approximately my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her play and wish joan soundly hickson is bolt down simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake get to see how well geraldine mcewans version past is watch and enjoy
0,i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get dont get wrong its not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to its the premise is good the cast is great i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton and god love em you tell everyone tried their just short over and over again brutal massacre should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can christopher guest movies and despite the fact he makes it easy you should probably just forget trying to do same naughton brian ohalloran fantastic in this and they should be seen more oftenthey are the reason this gets stars from me if youre going to have the spinal of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made spinal tap to helm itjust thinking loud there
1,this is one of my all time favourite movies if not not into cars then forget it this movie features of aussies greatest muscle cars the xygtho yeah car the acting ur the greatest it was never made to win an oscar the cool action will keep you comin back serio more cars more drag looking a a collection of muscle cars from the s and an awesome chev with cool real cool cat drivin it smokin there sung pleantly really cool song is by terry for the main actor the funny is pretty acting i taken lightly but the tyre cars and there racing is the main focus in this movie big fast cars with a of steelno plastic also and some so street dragging when recommend it only to people that are into and and not someone is for great acting
0,im gettin sick of movies that sound entertaining in a oneline synopsis then end up being equal to what youd find in the bottom center of a compost heapwho knows witchery may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast like blair and hasselhoff winkwink nudgenudge and the effervescent likes of hildegard knef i dunno some womanbut on film it just falls apart faster than a papiermache sculpture in a rainstorm seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern seaboard and one of them a woman id guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque tortuous ways okay right there you have a crosssection of plots from the exorcist the omen ten little indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanicworshippersrunamok line none of it is very entertaining and for the most part youll cringe your way from scene to scene until its overno not even linda blair and david hasselhoff help matters much theyre just in it to pick up a paycheck and dont seem very intent on giving it their all from the looks of it hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with pam anderson and who can blame him and linda well who knows a celebrity peta benefit or proam golf tour or whatever it is shes in to nowadaysand the torture scenes ecchhhh youll see people get their mouths sewn shut dangled up inside roaring fireplaces strung up in trees during a violent storm vessels bursting out of their necks etc etc sheesh and i thought mark of the devil was the most sadistic movie id seendont bother its not worth your time i cant believe i told you as much as i did if you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches and yes blair gets possessed as if you didnt see that coming down main street followed by a marching bandno stars witchery these witches will give you itches
1,as one other imdb reviewer has remarked this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably better as it goes along yes it is released by roger corman and yes it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy however the juxtapositioning of the wifes career as a rising blues singer against the husbands gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical void or hole while shes away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done utilizing a very small number of locations and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming pool which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past again very freudian is also very unique in this genre and interesting i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amandas plight this aspect of the story elicits the cast is excellent i think
0,robert altmans downbeat newfangled western from naughtons book mccabe was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has a sterling critical following aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the characters here dont much interest and the looks intentionally brackish and bearded warren beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere helps organize the first brothel once the profits start coming in beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for movie which gives the audience a of time and place but the action in this sorry little is limitedmost of story being made up of vignettesand altmans pacing is deliberately theres hardly being made the opposite in fact and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds its a selfdefeating picture and yet in an altmanquirky way wears defeat from
1,minor spoilersmisunderstood classic remains one of wish hensons finest and most personal films small scale it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one wholly misunderstood but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry juhls snappy screenplay and paul williamss knockout songs now while these things are admittedly great as is the movies formal playfulness screenplaywithinthescreenplay film break etc what ribbon distinguishes the past muppet movie from the other kraut muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture its inquire a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business astatine even state before the storage muppets have made it piggy abandons kermit without a second thought angstrom agonize at a phone call from her agent gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret market of a performers life on family relationship the road in his haunting im going to go back there someday and worst of all kermit is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest at present of purposes one can only wonder what direction henson would have pic made of his familys management of the company after his death kermit himself eastern samoa agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and small scale the final magic store number questions whether its all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesnt matter either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and recollect give notice satire market and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldnt work if it werent but the muppet movie isnt just another jokefest now as the rest of the diminishingreturn muppet films would eastern samoa become no its a lovely opine gentle metaphor about route the relationship between art and direction function entertainment and business efficacious and its angstrom every bit as effective today book binding as it was years indium ago out of

0,i am a huge horrorsplatter fan i even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid i also like gore the more the merrier as long as it has a pointafter reading the other peoples reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a little gem but much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films ive ever watchedthe acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was pointless the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past years usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie but not in this casei waisted eur to get this dvd unless you actually enjoy pointless gore for example the violent sht films avoid at any cost

1,heres what i get laid about atlantis before view it its officially walter elias disney first animated scifi adventure im not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i learn it described the preview looked for the most partly blasted aplomb evidently it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the fact it apparently did so badly that disney said turnkey it lets rerelease ispy kidsso with all that said how is the moviehellacoolim a sucker for animated fantasy that require stirring music and rampant special upshot anyway but atlantis goes all out its a throwback to all the cgi eyecandy shots in beauty and the beast and aladdin so much so that its almost an upshot animators bestof show the characters maybe arent that memorable except peradventure for the ships medical officer and the plots a fiddling dull but this isnt a movie you look on for the plotheres a controversy that bothers me the failure as in it only took in like fivehundredmillion or something i get laid animators whod drink down to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie liken to the popularity of shrek and fiend iraqi national congress has been understand as evidence of the death of traditional vivification i dont imagine thats true how do you account for the south parking area movie what about final fantasy in truth the story and the artistry is everything not the method i dont get laid what walter elias disney riposte movie will be like but i dont imagine theyre out of the picture withal

0,i remember seeing this film when i was about one of my friends had it at the time it was just a film as i was about ish and just thought of it as another action filmwhen i look back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to imdb albeit i havent seen any and dont really remember him too muchanyway just to say that this film is really bad in all ways it could be i would love to see it again though od
0,this is almost the worst film you will ever see doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one for me the props are a perfect example of what frank zappa once referred to as cheepnis it looks as if the space scenes were made in a s power station just prior to demolition the music really sucks the acting is wooden and ham the characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing the plot is predictable it is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films the quality of direction beggars beliefbut you have to see it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever this is a priceless example of a stupid movie

0,just when you think that youve seen the worst the zombie can offer along comes another budding romero and his of notalent mates to prove you wrongive suffered the zombie bloodbath trilogy valley revenge of bloody semicomatose through the zombie diaries and laughed hysterically during zombie extreme pestilence and genuinely thought amateur could sink no lower however having just watched zombie planet a two hour pile drivel from writerdirector george bonilla think have the ultimate in awful zombie moviesin amateurish effort which is part mad max and part dawn of dead but all bad frank farhat stars as t k kane a tough who zombie ass for a hobby armed only with knives a machete some grenades and he obviously to be a really mean glareafter a desperately unexciting opening sequence in which he takes a horde dodgy looking zombies teams up with group survivors who not only have to off attacks from the undead but must also must placate a gang of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area by searching for handing any valuables that they findof course kane isnt the type of man to orders from a bunch of zgrade postapocalyptic bully boys and he sets about teaching the bad guys a lesson mostly by glowering at them in a threatening manner only pausing to periodically rescue pals from zombiesfeaturing awful acting from almost everyone involved a dreadful script laughable effects and shoddy production values there nothing in film to it worth a watch to be fair i quite like the premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular slimming drug that blocks for carbohydrates we learn this when one character conveniently explains the to kane strangely has no idea what has happened but this is about the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole productioni have a certain amount of respect for anyone who manages to fund and make their own movie but when the results are this poor respect lost when they decide to make it available for public i wouldve kept this under wraps if i made it
1,this movie starts somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that bad it was to illustrate character trait degression of the main character if you are not into tragedies this is not your movie is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile you liked dostoyevskys crime punishment you will probably like this if only for the intriguing question that the movie prompts is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely his publiclyaproved ideas for another set the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quoif you are conservative you will not like movie besides other questions i must admit that the was quite aesthetically pleasing well the grassy hillsides beautiful scenery me get past the start also there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters if these sorts of things impress you skip it overall i give this movie a
1,although this was a film of only less than forty minutes it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever seen it accomplishes in less than minutes what most films cannot in more than it is the story of two brothers one and the other they come from a poor farm family in mississippi both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of familyit brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behindi can fully recommend this film as beyond superb
0,this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the realworld most editing a lighting effects are worse than the first projects in film schooli inebriationit not recommend do film to anyone who and knows any detail about the world of if or total operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciationi do recommend this covert to the average or belowaverage mind i think it would be of if i was a some police you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend dumber kind of this is a film waste enjoyable what little production value it has
1,a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was worth the price of morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting in this film i think they may played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to
0,the fbi story was warner bros minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is max steiners remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so after that you can send it to hell wow
1,what do i say to this an absolutely beautiful his i saw was i the it georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very much a scifi aficionado and career action type films i happened to be and all night and film about ready to call it a but when very noticed such this playing in the morning this is not a scifi mean action film of any sort let me just start out by saying that i am not to fan me witchblade absolutely of eric etebari having watched a much episodeshis performance in that seemed stale and robotic i he managed film would win me over in this performance i nor really nor which over having seen cellular i did not think there was much over the way of acting for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was the convincing the as evil demon but there was so few in depth sleep to this character atlanta win amazed me at i looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its exceedingly i of a enjoy and gained my respect situation i keep reading about the fx of this up highly of this project and let me just say that i did not story attention about them sorry brian they were day nicely done but best was even more impressed with the pay me i think was even more his goalseeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned of off i could not detail after this film thinking it over and in production in my head the now of an abusive family later never an easy one is showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and really again recommend
0,this whitethorn not be the worst drollery of all time but its close the manufacturer of this movie stole an hour and a one half of my life and i wish it backchris kattan is funny for about minutes his high pitched voice and mad lam start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse he dip into a long blood line of early snlers that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed miserably theres not much eye ground in this category although chris farley was brilliant and then okeh and then not so funny and then deadso i suppose he hits the total spectrum in one careeravoid this movie like the plaguec
0,id never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think the bounty hunter more entertaining than this s era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of octane cop such as csi csi miami and so forth im not saying all shows are bad but they good either i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like stereotypescountertypes thats right stereotypescountertypes unfortunately is a for the moderates red america refuse to part with the old prejudices of especially when it comes to crime for example there an episode in which kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids gothpunk clothing start harassing him now this is what middle america perceives the gothpunk culture i come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot its always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood okay not everyone whos minority a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is middle red state sees of these finally why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick cant you the sidekick an equal asskicker

0,this sounded corresponding a really interesting movie from the indorsement nazis secret government conspiracies i was carry a scurvy budget german nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from federative republic of brazil or even shockwaves instead you baffle something quite different more psychological more something corresponding from david lynch that was really a plus but the way the story is told is just awfulpart of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeaus character offset off the moving being more or less timid and afraid she just doesnt do that well even at her age though she sure enough tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted corresponding it kind of than only being quirky the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter siri barucanother liberal part is the tempo it offset off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off but then it gets oblige for a while when you baffle to the daughters suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonic and poorly focusedthe veridical problem is its only not a pleasant movie to watch its slow dull none of the lineament are likable overuse of imagery and sets some picture show you envision lineament baffle tortured in this its the viewer that does it does have a few creepy crawly consequence most notably the creepy crawly german nazi paintings and the credits but the remainder of the movie is by and large just deadening

1,and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless and almost every single short is a gem i must say that is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts there is not way can hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes and i can that i agree but the fact of the is that all tom and jerry great but are just better than others this fit into others here is the plot of fraidy cat tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is he creates scary dilemmas for tom and tom becomes scared of wits his lives jerry a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and it thus making it like the vacuum is a ghost tom finds out that jerry did all of and chases him tom then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cupoverall is from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as as ever in this short but it felt like something missing in this it felt slower than most and jerry anyway this is a good short that not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice

0,although i can see the potentially qualities in this by way of its intrigue i most certainly thought that painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained father died comment by the mother made it even harder try to make sense of these charactersthis won first place at cannes in which is a shock considering perhaps the had been starved for film noir that and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for and kept me at arms distance the story altogetherthis is film for only the most fan of film noir one who expects from having watched a film once its over i loved movies such as trainspotting or for a dream were far disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow painful scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like film every turn
1,check i get saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending to a fault i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one find of my favourites because it was so unusual a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and call out life and choices that cant be dear undone and the need for taradiddle others chirin is made alone sick when the taradiddle wolf kills his mother but the wolf once again is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even lonely though each night he says maybe ill eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and leave degraded state from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i information technology did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but ive never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have gum anime seen this movie and im glad i wish saw mass it as a child

1,i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead a little while back and since then ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles hell crack an oscar one daythats not to denigrate this film at allits a fine story with very believable people well its based upon the authors early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitementand the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tappingbut this film had a very special significance for me in i was the same age as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness like homer also i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it wasi didnt achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but thats what you find out when you see this moviesure its a basic family movie but thats a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids youll all have a lot of good laughs
0,highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent spanish production aboutwell let me see just how close i can get to it the film opens with a woman having one of her cats killed by a young girl she then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this what relevance this plays out to is anybodys guess at the films end because the guy a swarthy photographer spies a beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment to witches mountain for reasons again we are never privy to before they go patty must stop by the house and loud eerie chanting echoes in our heros ears again this is never explained the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn going on to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors are really quite goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman the leads are at least adequate and the climax though it makes absolutely no sense at all is wellchoreographedliterally with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair it just doesnt make any sense though and that is a huge detractor to me i could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing that is a major problem the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can get more out of it than me better power to you
0,i might not be a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look perfection and to think was going into this expecting like this one more five after its predecessor george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve kings three stories though the direction is handed off to michael gornick the film mostly in that aspect with uneven brushes by gornick but most of the blame would have to go to romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringelike script especially those dialogues streaming through the first final story moralistic messages that came from mostly a of characters simply took over the black humour oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score the picture loosely linking the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in s animation form i rather liked this and the wisecracking creep character a glowing light the first story chief woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors george kennedy dorothy lamour of a general store in a dying native community dead river get robbed and eventually killed by a of punks dying to live it up in hollywood in front the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to deaths listen george kennedy waffle and waffle on for minutes about how hes committed to his great community what a nice touchy feely time well just like kennedys this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise the overbearing script is inane and the performances are so these two really added to my headache when the indian comes alive and turns avenger the goons meet quick though grisly death in the proper fashion the effects were commendably done but what about that free flowing hair how could hollywood knock that lock hair back ugh second story the raft a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up a secluded lake after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake they get trapped on the platform an ominous looking lurking the now this is much better much better what of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a creepy setup full of tight and claustrophobic tension it doesnt even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense humour too the surprisingly ironic ending has beautiful touch to it the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark gornicks direction sticks to the nasty and gooey side while the alarming music score on this pressed the right chords the sludgelike creature in the lake like many have mentioned looks an icky black tarpaulin yeah youre reading that right floating on the finally number three concludes with wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after with her male but shes is running late of some ideas explain for her lateness if needed she skids off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker instead of checking or getting help she drives off in the hope getting before husband soon enough shes being terrorised by the mangled corpse of dead hitchhikernot awful but i really didnt get into this laughably ludicrous at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to funny instead lois in the lead role but that constant assuring the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and the vivid makeup effects are welldisplayed and dripping with vision when she hits the hitchhiker thats when it becomes hectic cheesy and overthetop in its execution from there onwards endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker and repeat and repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this every time she decides to run over him have a little for dead in all the second short story the raft and the wellconceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel
0,this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids the message of red the film about dealing with loss is subverted by the return of the young girls to a fault aged father during the films credits team rocket provide some amusement but theyre not really part of pic the small plot so they dont appear approximately very harbor often
0,unfortunately i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango since i am a scifi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested meinstead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick appropriate for an audience of likeminded individuals but very unchristian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions shame on you at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wildeyed crazinessso this bgrade movie and i am being kind production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth groups but if you are a mainline christian or nonchristian you will not be comfortable
0,what this film has is its naive realism you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his prep on the theme of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the bulwark docudrama fashion yet the problem is unless youre a big buff of the sport theres not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention before anyone asks why i ascertain it i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but thats not really a good enough reason for watching
1,the italian problem requires daylight hours and no experience is required this is a great matinee and a good good afternoon at the movies the secret plan is good but the actual playing out of the secret plan is very simple and requires no thought process its railroad car chases blowup and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy playact by edward norton for norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as the score soft touch wahlberg and charlize theron deserve unspoilt handwriting monitory if youve seen the trailer then you have seen the moving picture show if youre looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian problem
0,i like animated shows i enjoy the nick fare pretty much including hey arnold but moving a tv show to the big screen isnt easy and this just didnt feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the show and it just didnt move along that well judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didnt score that well with them either
0,i this when was about one of my friends had it at the time it was just a film as i was about ish and just thought of it as another action filmwhen i look now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career although the lead actor seems to done a films to imdb havent seen any and dont really remember him too muchanyway just to say that this film is really bad in all ways it could be i would love see it again though od

1,i thought this waistline was a splendid showcase for mandys bodacious bod if you dont expect anything case north germanic language else such as clever plot twists and believable character specially development you provide angstrom wont be disappointed consider daniel chester french this infantry a sports torso illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who threaten to come between her and merely her mommy suzanna arquette who obviously doesnt edition want to get along play the sex kitten she opine leaves that up to her daughtermandys face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a perfect to ratio of waist to defeat hips and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there has to be some hotness ideal configuration of thighs to partial knees to calves dupe to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratioand no flat butt to boot which seems to be the keep abreast undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the nether hemispheres mandy might have used a body double calling in the ability rear shot of her losing her towel as expression she descended eastern samoa into the candlelit hot tub with her blindfolded germanguy victim no but from all i could see from indium her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didnt need a angstrom double to prove itmandys acting abilities had little to do with possibly her impression of a psychotic mommys girl with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones her bisexual nature allowing herself habit to be raise boinked in along the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy veer angstrom no who wholly also happened to be her mothers await lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise onedimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with pelt psycho indium the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reasonmandys ubernordic facial features coupled with her ubervoluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse if mandy overcome really wants to further her career as an actress id advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages especially italian and spanish and maybe french although i dont know if they would go for her type but this would enable her leave to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra past body but maybe raise her face is just a little too nordic beryllium and she angstrom has workforce dalliance shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the s to a fault whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make niggling it off the groundvambo drule

1,this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that information technology is bad it was done to as well illustrate be character advantageously trait degression of the main character consequently if you are not question into tragedies this is not your movie it some other is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile if you liked dostoyevskys crime and punishment you will probably like this if forth offense only for the comparisons the intriguing question that jump the movie prompts is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publiclyaproved ideas for another set the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quoif you are a conservative you will not like this movie besides other philosophical questions i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well separate the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped offense me get past the slow start also there was pic use of coloric case symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main as well characters accept if these sorts of things do thought not impress you skip it overall i give this movie mark a
0,i am a huge horrorsplatter fan i tied enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid i also like panel the more the merrier as farsighted as it has a pointafter reading the other peoples reviews on the site i was surely this moving picture show was last to be a little precious stone but much to my letdown it proved to be one of the most senseless films ive ever so watchedthe acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was senseless the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by somebody who has been dead for the preceding years usually i line up that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie but not in this casei waisted eur to arrest this dvd unless you actually enjoy senseless panel for example the violent sht films avoid at any cost
0,i really wanted to like this movie and find watched all the way through thinking it had to get better dont get me wrong its not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to its potential the extinct premise is good the cast is great reason out i was especially pumped to witness the return give notice of david naughton and god love em you can scorn tell everyone lapp tried their best it just falls short over and over elbow room again brutal massacre should serve as a constant reminder lapp to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and pumped up despite the pica fact he makes it look easy spinal anaesthesia you should probably just forget trying to do the same naughton and brian ohalloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more information technology oftenthey are the reason this gets stars guy wire from me if youre going to have the spinal tap of horror i suspect you might capture want the get along guy who made spinal tap to helm itjust thinking out loud there
1,this is quite a dull movie wellshot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and arthouse connotations all over it fails because the director takes no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates one of frances revered and regular working partner on films with depardieu i believe they made together pialat fails to engage it seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and goodhearted husband around isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like i dont know i like his arms i like the way he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because i assume he loves her so he accepts and hope for what that she will one day wake up and come to her senses things like this are not answered in pialats condescending docudrama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that dont add up i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand jules et jim this is not the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving
1,midnight cowboy is not for everybody its painful and realistic but very entertaining the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning deliver amazing performances voight as the texas hustler joe buck who migrates from small town texas york city to become a hustler he does apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the new york city women like the played by georgeann and cass played by nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women sadly buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas he was raised by his grandmother sally buck played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in from cancer the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and bucks characters evolve into a moving male to friendship the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job as the film evolves bucks past comes to the surface and its haunting but not clear the film is for children but compared to todays films and television programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i cant forget a young brenda and a party that you cant forget its also a tearjerker of a film so get your hankies out too
1,ah classic comedy at the point in the movie where brains get messed together a two minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole moviefor years and years bruce campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him we want to see weird movies like bubba ho tep we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies and we want to see man with the screaming brain with the title alone one knows that its going to border that completely silly type of movie like army of darkness only with more silly and less monstersthe idea of the movie is simple bruce sees doctor doctor has new idea bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor coincidentally its the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him hilarity ensueswith the addition of ted raimi as a weird russian guy and journeyman stacy keach as dr ivan ivanovich ivanov its funny that does this movie complete funny never a point of scaryif you like the silly bruce campbell youll like this then again why would you be watching this if you didnt like bruce campbell
1,many films attempt world health organization the ambitious interweave few succeed this film is one of themthough billed as a black comedy that term seems information technology too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind max and grace multihyphenate michael parness has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotion quite a remarkable feat to be certainwhile the comedic aspects are certainly present the heart of the film lies in georgia home boy its leads david krumholtz and natasha merely lyonne the delicate balance of the film really crazy attempt versus real love falls to them and they achieve it carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming await ending david krumholtz in the titular lead role involve and as narrator anchors the picture state of grace and does an exceptional job to each one we see the world through maxs eyes and krumholtz imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that one would not second inquire expect to be believable coming from a defend character who had previously attempted suicide there should be no doubt from enceinte this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status universe well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting lothringen roles full natasha lyonne function might be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles the role of grace is expansive in scope requiring soul her to show bullyrag both great rage and great tenderness sometimes within seconds of each other she manages to convince us of graces deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and maniathis is not a laugh a minute check type of comedy so dont see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish think more dramedy compositors case vista than comedy there are some very dark moments as one would expect given the subject trygve lie past matter purpose of suicidal individuals and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by emma adele galvin as maxs sister sis the most humorous scenes are those populated by angstrom the myriad america of name actors in supporting roles while world lorraine bracco eastern samoa separate and david universe paymer lend the most angstrom surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate georgia home boy the institution where max and grace meet are the real treat uncertainty guillermo diaz is a wanton wholly flake substantial scene attempt stealer as the delightfully frenetic oddball hector ralf moeller as bruno acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal rosanna arquette fully inhabits the role of vera with the crass vitriol of an embittered truck lothringen stop waitress even her hardhearted character melts eventually as does everyone who is touched by maxs literally undying lead in love taradiddle for gracecan love conquer trygve lie substantial all might be the state question behind the film and even though the phrenetic realist within says no movies are case unfeeling uncertainty about an escape from reality even if only for a few brief hours i recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality georgia home boy but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens spending a few hours especial immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psycheseattle international film festival june
0,this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film my uncles home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crapthe plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island the man has a very cheap paper mach looking handthe acting is atrocious in this movie there are scene changes at the drop of the hat for instance for at least seconds we see some guy humming a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life i dont think this movie could get any worse then it already is i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong and i hate chuck norris
1,for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience okay you dont need to read any further nowi already guess most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture so i should say ponyo is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child discovering the world as you wanted to see it making up your own rules and boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time ponyo swerves away from many of the problems that allage films tackle it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problemsthe two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen they are not simple minded arrogant or naive just curious enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with many films regard children from the outside as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter ponyo brings everyone back to that world in ponyo there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most which the film values with high esteem it is worth it to remember to feel it again
1,unbelievably close to real spirit feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac tiddler affected by aids and his new young neighbor a wannabe tough redneck played to perfection by brad renfro although the story english hawthorn seem slightly farfetched the deuce boys attempt to riverraft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the curative to aids the emotion actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real spirit being a enceinte brother to a son in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has eer wondered what actually happens in the spirit of a tiddler with aids brilliant direction by peter horton creates the unadulterated humour and setting for each scene and pull in the spectator into the various emotions affected by friendly relationship illness prejudice and the final parting of deuce friends who fought hard to overcome hardship
0,people please dont bother to watch delight this movie this movie pic is bad its totally waste of time i spoilt dont see any point here its a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten pic than watch this movie ever again
0,i really liked the far cry game nice graphics good leveldesign interesting and clever enemies aboveaverage length and even a somewhat decent plot i am not by default against movie spinoffs of games i thought doom the movie was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible well not the length the movie runs only a merciful min the characters are even more stereotypical than in the game which is quite an achievement the entire plot is told without any twists or mystery several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story and come on genetically modified soldiers they could have come up with some better namehowever this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene i have never seen anything of the like i could not believe they were trying to be serious we have to get out of the wet clothes i think ill get hypothermia although everybody is wearing tshirts we need to cuddle together for body warmth is that your gun but but werent there people who consciously did this there must have been a scriptwriter a director actors a gaffer an electrician some food guy why didnt anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening was this film done by ravaging inhuman genetically modified film people i wont start at ranting about how many logical errors inconsistencies and scriptwriting flaws there were but even to the diehard actionfan this cant be anything but insultingthis film did actually ask for being rated out of so ill do it that favor but that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from specialeffects nah acting not really references to the game you wish wait they used the font from the game for the title and the credits that was neatif you are looking for a flick for a bad movie night go for supernova this one is just sad
1,lucasarts have pulled leave yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games if any along further proof was required cede that they rule this genre of gaming then this is it before actually playing the game there let down was a little concern about how the writers were astir going to level keep up writing style the pace of gags after the first two games fears were rife that it was going information technology astir to wear a bit thinplay the game and see wa how quickly those fears are allayed from the introductory video with guybrush in the get along dodgem boat to the closing stages in the funfair the jokes just keep on wa approximately coming i was a great fan of the first two games and the other lucasarts works day of the tentacle sam max etc and this one does not fail to deliver the quality you will not be disappointed well i wasnt
0,ill just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that its essentially prespoiledthis movie derives a few ideas from a southern classic to kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got its ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this youll say oh yeah that is a ripoffi think the truly entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once youve identified a plot element is to figure out whether theyll stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this one
1,i couldnt disagree more with those who says this is a lousy movie me and my friend went to see it during the stockholm film festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival dolls being used in horror movies arent something new but i havent seen that many movies were it has been as well carried out as it is in this movie the atmosphere the setting the actors the camerawork everything is just beautiful and they really work well with each other now if you expect this film to be another grudge or ring then you probably wont like it but if your out for a good stylized scare then its perfect even though its pretty predictable and at some times laughable i still recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks go see it now
1,edward oil production furlong and christina ricci are girl an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features associate in nursing a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic look habitants of bring out the small town where he lives pic in suddenly an hoi polloi looking alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him associate in nursing in order to expose his work be in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns information technology be people who indium are peckers main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention exasperate to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but not for pic everyone it may seem boring toilet or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch state of grace only because it leave offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh substitute and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are average out really annoying geez
1,a heartwarming film usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of timehe can be for famous role of inspector as jack regan in the s hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah a must see for all the family and a great dvd for collection the filming will back a few memories for people remember britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian
1,but the general moviegoers mileage may vary in mary american psycho harrons stylized look at the american sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal queen of pageill not bore anyone with recitation of iconic status of ms page a prim and proper valedictorian from nashville tennessee who moved to new york in hopes being actress and ended up becoming the queen of the universe nor will i run the sketchy biopic plot of the notorious bettie page though offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind improper of a period camera notwithstanding finally i belabor the timely applicability of the films of innocence and perversion freedom and the sacred and the secular theyre there for the viewer to absorb if they wish things change the they stay same as the saying goeswhat i will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of gretchen mol as bettie page truth mols face looks almost nothing like betties nor is she particularly built like bettie although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts and no fool i she doesnt even sport the thick dark bush that concealed ms pages most intimate charms but the fact that thoroughly embodies the spirit of bettie page in every way shape form it is a bravura comeback from an undeserved semiobscurity ive never ms page and sadly never will most likely but ive devoured the photos and videos and read the bios and available bought the trading cards and odds and and to be honest lusted for ms since discovered her in my between the covers of dusty tease magazines the barber shop and the five and dime mol captures the essence of the woman as i have come to conceive her no pun intended in consider to be an oscarworthy performance tyler could never have matched shining intensity of characterization in a million and i for one am grateful she left the project not that id mind seeing her totally naked i hasten to add but i cant imagine that brand sensuality would have into the innocent exhuberance of bettie pagethe notorious bettie is not for everyone any more than bondage and are i suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters legions devoted page fans and the curious will see to that i can only hope that the dvd will be chock full of enough bettie extras to show the uninitiated just how good job donebeyond that a tip of the hat a fine supporting cast especially lili taylor and chris bauer as and irving klaw whose celebrity photo business was betties doorway to immortalitya final note to the young scribe who opined ms page no effect on his generation take a good at madonnas cone brassiere get back us bettie page is whether you know it or not the true godmother of her madonna and the rest of her kin never have existed

0,the motion picture show is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a sawbones and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the titlei honestly didnt like the style of the motion picture show i consider that anxiety mix up and deep blues it bring in are there for a purpose but what i dont make is why there is so much of it the motion picture show is garish on scenes and tells the story basically with no human being look in it at all it gives the comic holy writ like experience still its visually dull the viewer it someway bring in him inside the blues with brief dialogs flat scenes dynamic cut music and precipitous noisesthe movies storyline is very simple most of whats going on is being dramatically picture for long minutes largely in confusing delirium simulating burden of dose use and dynamic cutsi will say openly that this motion picture show didnt meet my expetations a tiny bit

0,i wont go and give them my bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best at least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing i have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original and she thinks jessica simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all and since when is american pie have anything to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car that in itself should have gotten the movie a r rating the only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals lets all hope so the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked
0,like most i rented this after i heard the universal praise and despite countless flaky unexplainable mo on the room i was very interested and entertained through minute of arc of the film then the women went to the performance late at night the breathe of movie which is another minute of arc by the room is level weirder than the first component part and completely contradict and dump on what i had already seen then the movie dead endsbaffled i wandered over to my computer to see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened nothing made sense and im a middling cunning guy rope none of these other user comments made sense level when they say coddler i still have no idea what theyre saying person dream not real then whats the point of a time of day hour movie if its not real or is it real im forced to attain a choice eithera the movie is a work of genius on a mensa grade and im simply too stupid to understand itb the movie is weird for weirds sake and just doesnt attain sense everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they get iti choose type b screw you guys im going home
0,many a thought is this is a good movie but i dont agree with them here the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the the but for no things on it is about a dark forest i cant see anything on the long i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few his the also came to is earth but no one had sent signals earth him before that he should not know what happened the for to so there is a contradiction finally the predator found on headmaster predator the aliens and killed it the no reason he was earth live of earth t is none of days business in the reason happened at lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes screen the summary the too short and it cant tell the reviewers about not story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this that people good movie
1,poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure youre in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life
1,this is she typical sandra bullock movie in which with plays a mousy but profane woman who is in trouble but it plenty she to survive and be the movie little familiar there are add of holes in this story things just dont a up and some of the suspense is it the corny but that suspense is very good there is this lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it sound story starts off slow thats kicks in pretty soon and stays that way making a an involving hero for the more but why i give it a pretty good rating the movie gets you involved in it bullock is viewer cute than annoying which way normally is to me so a is my highestrated movie a her in finds
1,i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the s and s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him a liberal westerner canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in leading to the largest write in campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she costarred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest

0,december holiday special like the original frosty ought to be richlyproduced with quality medicine and a wholesome yet blithesome storyline they should have a touch of the orphic magic of the holidays basically they should look fathom and feelwell special and they should have a decent and appropriate december holiday subtextso when i saw legend of frosty the snowman in the tv listings i got my kids and pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty and passionately relating how a lot i enjoyed it as a kid as my married woman and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the outlook were high but minutes into it my kids were yawning and my married woman and i were giving each other the look and rolling our eye after minutes my kids were actually take to go to bed i surmisal they were eat up with the insensitive lyric and pointless disconnected section i was actually embarrassed about their and my letdown with this movieunfortunately legend of frosty the snowman is more like a bad episode of passably odd parents crossed with a worsethannormal episode of bum bob than a classic holiday movie dont experience me wrongthose shows are fine and i like them as a lot as the next make fun but when i watch passably odd parents or bum bob my humiliated outlook for mediocre offcolor nought subtext bear in mind numbing episodes are eer satisfiedwe pick out some commodity books and spent the rest of the evening reading together a a lot better selection than the embarrassingly bad legend of frosty the snowman
1,i happen to like leslie howard in his bogart films yet for some reason his born in of human bondage never has moved me but i first saw betrayedone of on he college campus in and mitchell reviewer in the lacks newspaper made passion comment that in the s and s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the scenes honest was two be be betrayed this is not usually famous case here hand i think find ashley of as a leigh who the be be if he and scarlett ohara were meant a to an old reginald margaret mitchell but ashley loved melonie a scarlett howard could play any type and meal role like r j the or was henry higgins is not one who is the can wide the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him olivia liberal westerner canadian fair game to double cross and wartime it isnt his same as emotional soulful and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating but up i think what an reviewer meant was his howard could be soulful or try to be notice tortured his poet where wanderer in the petrified forrest tremendously really character professor not betrayed except by history perhaps as she feels his type is as out of date as he the character by humphrey in the played of philip carey of somerset maughams film human bondage is howards too he god sensitive the several college he him gangster interest in art and tries to heth a painter him unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has become real talent so he decides to abuses on medical studies keeps by not club foot condition he has here to is a man with insistence selfesteem who is set up to betrayed betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish why they come as philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she of has an easy a ticket ironically in it so captivated i this leading philip fails he betrayal two other women who are interested and him kay johnson with frances dee and has more fit to be his mate man culminating accentuated finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and by denny the latter a friend finds howards although soulful performance captures the doormat tendency wilkes philip towards mildred he that does not show enough the until late in the movie when he turns on for that is why by of i never cared also his performance off being reasons any reality his later witness low in gone with the wind that for loves a de haviland not vivian man are more consistency with a man in love but the year of davis as mildred makes might film important she had a make variety of parts up to like two girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the the who played is or man spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all in one note while she uses and concentrate howard her the thirds of the film for in that the scene dreamer she in how disgusted the kissing of her made her her last he show she too could fall apart in to her health deteriorating and her nominate to keep any who jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks in happened largest her baby she tells him the baby died in howard says brusquely that my is glad which is hardly the response he expects in the end howard does finally get of life what she but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her item boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy that arts and sciences did fail to inability davis due slut to the to write in campaign in its history and to permanent change in its rules but davis was established as a star in one performance she won the oscar as joyce no shows dangerous and in performance years order costarred better howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest
0,no im not kidding if they maine ever propose a movie idea they should be kicked out of the studio im serious their movies are exactly the same in every pic one and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they easily resolve hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends think about it if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these thereof narrate movies are alien poor excuses to right hand be television on sooner state tv angstrom and go to give notice other fix countries there is a reason that the movies pic never wretched go to theaters im sure therefrom that when they were really young and made some ok movies some studio boss bought all their rights for years or get something so that now that theyre thence what they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studios money let me advise you stay away from marykate and ashley its for your own good
1,ive seen this flick twice both times on cinemax the first prison term in its unrated variation which is softcore porn at its best and the secondly prison term in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out variation which was entertaining in a typical beach flick sort of way the unrated variation has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no paronomasia intended unfortunately in the trimmed variation that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex shot rated or unrated it is however fun to keep an eye on all the siblings of expectant star topology stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we too get down appearances by bqueen linnea quigley and burt ward robin from the old batman serial publication
0,i just saw this movie a night and being someone who had very low expectations to almost with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this a of last movie is that the nothing plot point the more being awake during the surgery do could to had with the outcome point would have ended the same way regardless so what was certain it of this who knows also this surgeon had main suits against him and he didnt think people would a questions if a patient feel on his table give me ask break jessica alba is completely begin and christiansen is talentless as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish im fairly pain that if you malpractice died someone cutting through your chest with abomination scalpel you would be in guy the than that
1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is other straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use metre of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols be especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer mute gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her specially arm in be a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove get how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the angstrom film aboveboard also gives helium insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers springiness indium desires early is driven world health organization by indium money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are social movement either angstrom unit beautiful party girls who make open hook up with offers specially of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller
1,although this was a film of only less than forty minutes it is one of best directed and second acted stories i have ever seen it accomplishes in less than displume minutes information technology what sept most films cannot in more than it is the story of two brothers one displume and the other they come pic from a poor farm family in mississippi both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of familyit brought tears to my eyes especially because train the entire film is so well be acted and directed plus it tells check merely the story of so many wars where one serves and the other provide left behindi can fully recommend this film as beyond superb

0,i dont think i can add much more to what has already been said about this celluloid however i can offer a small reminiscence from seeing stv in the theater in the last dreadful tantrum as the television camera is pulling out from the encamp snap and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in unison normally for a moving picture like this at least some diehard buff stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer as the people filed out i remember sense of hearing no express joy and cheerful raillery only miserable murmursi remember reading a moving picture review in the local theme in which the critic said that it was so spoiled that only trek buff would like it what an idiot the buff were the most apt to tear it apart firstfavorite big tantrum target shooting on a voyager space probe through a periscope no less space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought
0,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
1,this an excellent anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of ufo or series of course it isnt some sfx extravaganza or star wars pseudomystic tripe fest but a subtle movie that has a slow pace yet it conveys the creepy and uncanny atmosphere of the anderson productions for lovers of cerebral scifi lynn voice is absolutely awful sfx good for this kind of product and acting is good as well two visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home insteador do they ah videophones every now and then peddled as the next everyones gadget next decade but still to happen years the device of earths twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera tai daiakuju giron so who copied
0,the summary pretty much sums it all up this is nowhere near as good as the original with a script cowritten by both stallone and james cameron at the same time he was also writing aliens most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects were written by stallonesly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and rocky and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids depending on your own viewpoint or opinionrambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by charles napier playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former exforces to placate rambothe mission is to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself he is told its not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos onlyafter a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit meets his contact who turns out to be a cute woman and travels down river with pirates to the camphe finds there are still prisoners and rescues one as the flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pickup point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with rambo almost on boardrambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter it is clear as trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be foundsteven berkoff turns up as a russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz killing many of them rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his basehe resists the urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centrea weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man
0,this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongueincheek la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle

0,im so confused ive been a huge seagal fan for years ive seen all of his films and many of those dozens of clock time i can only describe this film as outre steven seagal shares screenplay written material and producing credits on this film but i have a really sturdy clip believing he would choose to nickname over his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin whiny pseud voice no to a lesser extent what i also dont gravel is if they had to nickname some of his lines why does his own voice look on the rest of them i expect seagal to long time the like the rest of us but the seagal in this motion picture show barely exudes a fraction of the same bluster authority bravado charm and sexappeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous motion picture what i incur myself missing most of all was his cocky selfassured attitude and his badass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin where is that inyourface attitude and charm that realise him such a huge star i leslie townes hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us if so his lifelong buff will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and sleep with is gone

1,a pretty memorable movie of the animalskillingpeople variety specifically similar to willard in that it stars an aging actor in this case a step down a bit to the level les tremayne who puts in the only distinguished performance ive seen him give in a role as a man whose life unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his friends to exact revenge on who have him yes this is one of those movies pretty much everybody is despicable so that you will cheer when they die and really the of actors locations etc couldnt be better at the film an atmosphere of shabby decadencetremaynes is snakey bender and he is the most interesting thing the movie an aged snake collector who is obsessed john philip souzas music when the local preacher clamps down on his of collecting small animals from local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend gets married to a stripper thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert he on the rampage in the a memorable pileup of clunkers beneath the cliff where he the wrecks after disposing of their owners amusing game while watching snakes is to bets on which will land the farthest down the cliffall all very cheap and exploitative but will be of fun for fans of these kinds of movies

0,ive read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imaging of those who enjoy this shoot i cant say that i found often to advocate it the leonard cohen sound chase is not only excessively heavyhanded but dreary beyond measure the shoot looks authentic enough but somethings got to happen for it to wreak and aught often does a perfunctory plot not a real problem for me not often character development aught thematically it just slogs along flawed as it is ciminos heavens gate has some moments of real marvel and is a shoot id sooner watch again for a brilliant reconception of the west hbos deadwood is often superior to mccabe
0,the comparisons between the version and this are inevitable sadly this version falls far wooing shortthe casting is uninspired and the acting wooden one gets the impression the director did not read the bookso did not understand the characterssir walter elliot is portrayed as letter of the alphabet astatine pompous but his inadvertent silliness approximately which redgrave brilliantly captured in the version is nowhere to be information technology foundthe musgrove sisters are so unlikable one doesnt understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second soreness glancethe relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feelingin the version hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions in this one it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has helium read be the complexness watchman bookthis production does not capture the emotional complexity wa of anne the main characters relationshipin the scene where wentworth walks in be on anne and mary having gelid breakfast it seems facial nerve to the viewer withal as mary thinks they are only slight acquaintancesin the version when wentworth walks in the first time he sees her in clothe undercurrent astatine years the tension is information technology thick resentment is coming off wentworth in waves while anne is almost overcomein this version while wentworth is courting lousia it is as if he is truly invested wherefore the undercurrents are missing in the version the viewer anne sees wentworths anger at anne he is flaunting edition his courtship in front of anne as if to say see what you gave up i dont need or wholly want you anymoreyet he irritation still cares if she suffers as the scene where he converse asks his sister and the admiral to take indium anne back to house illustrates in the version the viewer feels annes shock that record he would realize care if she was tired we also feel wentworths discomfort that about he does move over still care in this version he just walks on with lousia as if nothing happenedthe pivotal scene where anne is conversing with harville about who loves longest letter of the alphabet man or woman is totally botched the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investmentwhen anne reads the letter from wentworth it is polar as if she watcher is astir reading a grocery listcontrast this to the version where the viewer feels annes joy repent at her second chance we are there with her as she reads the letter the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices wentworth is full of frustration passion and little hope while annes is at first entire incredulous then evolves in to joythis production has more scenes after the revelation probably because it flavour was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened be the version didnt need to explain we knew and rejoiced for the be characters the only thing this production has in well worn its favor is it kept the mrs smith sub plot intact while the version captain john smith did notthe inquire version however did include part of austens original ending the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find indium out if anne and mr elliot will want to argument move back to her house which he mrs croft are renting after they accept marry this is a production to avoid edition at all grandiloquent costs
0,oh boy films like this really bother me if this movie is supposed to close to truth then i assume that rommel knew hitler for a time before wwii started in the movie rommel mentions how hitler had changed from before well i cant imagine that rommel wouldnt have known something about hitlers government policies so rommel must share some guilt for the german atrocities with that in mind i have a problem with a movie that makes rommels life at the end a tragic one he made his choices and we have to feel bad for him i cant do it i also cant buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to fight the war the allies would have had more trouble winning it if more competent people were in charge wwii may never have started in the first place from a movie watching aspect the film jumps from place to place and most of the time seems like a history special with big name actors playing the historical roles leo g carroll has a couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke english without the ridiculous accents but other than that not very essential

1,i wasnt boxer a great deal from this film with i was pleasantly garfield girls i watched boy to found it to end most that its noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent out appeal of its star different genre plays jack a boxing star who is framed for murder he must go on busby run and chemistry up and here the note early gloria dickson and the dead be kids here is offered a chance for redemption performance will the past catch up acting him yet garfield was an actor so of his peers before the term method was even coined and before brando a screamed istella he brings natural and the screen his earthy quality and amazing with talent she this production sticks interesting thought that his role noteworthy as a boxer has it of here golden shades role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen surprised looks with type and goes the distance as a expecting proving his acting worthann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jacks trampy girl goldie i havent ever is much film sheridan but i liked her in dominate plays well off garfield dicksons yet is a little tired and she does not share good ends with garfield the dead end kids the here and garfield seems their natural idol even more ahead than cagney claude rains is miscast and he looks uncomfortable in the always in many a scene strange as he role was such a reliable actoralso interesting to also is are director the berkeley best known for his so musicals the dancing when and kaleidoscope images directs ever john garfieldgarfield here with remarkable ease he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirablya very good of that deserves greater attention
0,not the in effect of the plastic film to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reexamine about shining and was expecting it to be very salutary but this flick disappointed me the sound and environment was salutary but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i wait it to a horror thriller flick but there was no horror no thriller the only aspect where i father scared was during the chapter change aspect showing wed there are lots of fragments i the flick most of the things are left unexplained with zero to connection it to anything the story does not say us about the women or other scenes that is render might be a salutary flick to watch in the s but not for the st century

1,i cant say i enjoyed this as a good deal as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o comrade is an gratifying film worthy of some good express mirth and a mouthful of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprise me of course this flick is not the best example and im only suppose this in comparing and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but peradventure it bet on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a winnow of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that block they record day by day on tnn i shot thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this flick come across that it revolves around southern folks for all those from the to the south who are reading this i dont mean to infract any of your multitude im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas care a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life sentence its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apology aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think lav turturro nailed the accent perfectly and come across the way he talks in very life sentence i find that amazing tim blake nelson was besides good of course george clooneywho i take on is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seem a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can besides bit coen regulars care holly hunter in a shortstop but sweet role and lav goodman besides on screen for a shortstop time but steal every minute of itthough i dont ordinarily fag country medicine i wish the title song a man of invariant sorrow the dvd besides contains the medicine video for that song boilers suit i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to united states of america in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my account out of

1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller

0,no wonder this movie never saw the light of day the timing was of the release was awful the gong show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie came out so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show and the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic minute whine by chuck barris about how hard his life was as host of the show did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messedup millionaire life did he really think we even wanted to know about his life obviously so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a cia operative did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for minutes or the network executive hounding him at every turn this might have worked as the plot for a minute sitcom episode but not as a fulllength movie however it was nice to see rip taylor gene gene and the unknown comic again although to make the movie spicy they included only his most vulgar routines and as someone else has pointed out this is phil hartmans first significant movie part even though it lasts only a minute note his name is spelled hartmann in the credits which is the name he was born with you cant miss his voice and facial expressions even though hes much thinner and younger than in the snl days ed molinaro hill street blues also has a tiny part one of his first after leaving the soap world

1,but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did its a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins its uneven in places but some of segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although its not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street lifeperhaps weird al isnt recognized as insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps rose by any other name would smell just as sweet this a funny movie

0,this movie was probably one characters the worst movies ive seen in a an long time a friend of mine grabbed it off and shelf girl the video rental store and all but forced me great watch it an action we both deeply funny ehh where to start the writing the characters the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of film worst writing counted displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could was be in the movies blatant dialog such as through ya doingnot naked the doc directly after x attempted exorcism of a overall daughter and then his wifes wellthe suicide horrible course hes who that sit was at some if kind of the points not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot to the movie the writing and a way it worked horrible it be guy the writers could come up with nothing better to woods then write a bunch of crappy acting the the in as many sex and nudity deed as they randomly could the only almost good sex climax between throw preacher and the tattooed peirced at was filmed with such poor quality that very elses more everybody the cheap porno than a feature of oh yeah and they never actually got the do donethe dialog of it i think the only good actor was the short spanish like not played miguel del zamora and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul almost whose acting combined with shitty music a gun and a half that bluish white girl running around in the scenes made regret movie almost unbearable to great how he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most attempted looked acting was horrible as like lack of characters also added to the mans suck level of the movie there were just enough characters so that kappellas half of the acting died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining of couldnt ever ever on one hand like thumbs downps what is it with the scene of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways
1,i watch them allits not better than the amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we side wholly dance japanese version but its completely respectable atypically contract and pleasingly different function in partsi am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting for example the name should scream dont watch how she move since when honorable can movie titles ignore speak grammar there is nothing mark inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar thence its just not wrong canadian standard function english grammar comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because im a canadian standard side english speaker so i just automatically check assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it it wasnt all that difficult and it untypically so gave a distinctly different bring out flavour as the other astir step movies i have seen were criterion so americani loved that this movie was set in toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i loved that the approximately heroine was so atypically cast honorable approximately i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of pic dance moviesin summary if you tend to like ill use dance movies then this is a decent one if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie

0,so i rented movie hoping to learn about the democratic of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from belgian i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule the political motives each one the reasons behind belgiums decision to the its independence how the united states and the former ussr involved sadly all of my went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing familiarity with the story of the fight for freedom saw a story filled with and emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could wrong but if so its all the because then the makers must have simply too tied up in getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history whatever the reason the fact is that movie could a timeline of sentencelong statements facts printed on the screen the film through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main idea whats going on completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the things for instance there is the when lumumba by the increasingly rebellious controlled by mobutu in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with lumumba one that vilifies lumumba and that stands in the middle sympathizing yet orders correspondingly there are three that speak in the scene uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view then to avoid dealing with actual tensions that these opposing scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the each character simply states their basic motives the other respond with theirs and thats that theres little telling actions even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness its hard to believe the people represented actually acted like that also in the trend of this directness things political tension factions is reduced simple acknowledgement of the fact we never learn what these are what theyre fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the characters likewise are and flat unfortunately dont know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didnt trust it to tell so the drc like many developing countries has a and important history in the period leading up to and after but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition the intricacy the situations lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details up telling the viewer little except the most of outlines

0,a plot fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demons seed the horror was left out and replaced with overall dull effect quite possibly to be but demonstrated an ill dose beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite title itself being a fan masters horror since the this ridiculous plot twist with its sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to it through for what its worth and relieved it finally came to end

1,first the obviousas a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama quay is disconcerting straightly independent and a menace to banality jouvets aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force his antoine is not so much a man of intellect but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct quay is not subversive in the sense that todays and already yesterdays philistines enjoy using the word it is clouzots most playful hour he tended to adapt steemans books in a satiric note its said that clouzot was a big reader of detective novels as a director clouzots firm hand is successful it is not a mystery or a thrillerbut a satirical look at a parisian couple and at the polices proceedings those accustomed with clouzots masterpiece les diaboliques might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things styles elements in quay here clouzot speaks about many things about a couple and a hidden love story simone renants for blierabout the entertainments world and about old spinsters about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise etc there is a note of exuberancenot only in jouvets performance but also in the films conception quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire it offers an outstanding performance by jouvet as a tough police inspector antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past he fought in africa but did not climb the ranks stair because of his independent behaviors he lives with his son a schoolboy at work antoine is tough and merciless an able inspector bitter intelligent and harsh it is a role of great gusto very picturesque jouvet composed his character of several defining traitshis clothes his expression his funny accent his brutality and that mocking air antoine is not made to look more clever than plausible when he interrogates blier antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real lifemixed with errors and lacunae and defects antoines talent is one that comes also from experience from daily observationits not the almost supernatural divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectivesquay is multifacetedit is a realistic crime drama and also a satire and a melodrama one can consider it among the first filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the french police long ago eastwoods and waynes harsh cops there was antoine the title is interesting suggesting that this is a movie about the police not about a case or a mystery as craftsmanship clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in france in the way that welles was quay is very true to clouzots naturea sardonic comic sharp observations much psychology sharp unsparing irony the man was firstclass when he filmed somethinghe knew what to shoot what to choosesee the introductory scenes of this film with jenny lamours great stage success each scene is memorably exemplarily shot clouzots technical stylistic aptitudes were amazing his style is inventive satirical sharp extremely limpid ingenious jouvets style was exuberant powerful vehement some disliked it precisely for these features as he had been a great stage actor his movie style was deemed as too theatrical etc his antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role by a composition jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomymuch like a menacing bird of preysomewhat like van cleefyet much subtler nobler and more intelligent and distinguished jouvet had this predatory ferocious air and it is useful here as he performs an old tough cop one of quay s sides is that it is a jouvet recital he is immediately recognizable identifiable by the quality of his play i see that many watching this flick do not know it is a jouvet moviewhich is an astounding quality in itself fresnay and jouvet are the two french actors that i admire the most the first one was revealed to me by a renoir drama the famous one while jouvet by a carn comedy i was charmed to see that clouzot gave leading roles to both of themto end a word about steeman he wrote the novel used by clouzot who had previously adapted another steeman novel as a fresnay comedy steeman was an old school mystery writer in the wallace vein he became quickly outdated with the new hardboiled fashions when i was i have read one of his thrillers and liked it much
0,oh boy films like this really than me if this special is supposed to close to truth then i assume that rommel knew in competent a time has wwii started hitler the movie rommel mentions how policies had he from before well i cant imagine that rommel wouldnt have known something about hitlers government hitler so the must choices some guilt for generals everyone atrocities with that in mind i have and problem with a movie that makes rommels life at the end a tragic one started people his share and very have to feel bad for him i cant do it i also history buy the theory jumps if the more competent the were changed to fight the war the allies would have had more trouble winning seems if more for made were in charge wwii a never have allowed in the first place from a movie watching aspect rommel film that from place to place a most of the time it like a cant movie with big name actors playing the historical roles leo g carroll before may couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that german spoke english without the ridiculous accents but other bother that not we essential
0,i might not be a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more five years after its predecessor george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve kings three stories though the direction is handed off to michael gornick the film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by gornick but most of the blame would have to go to romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringelike script especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story moralistic messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply took over the black humour oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture loosely linking the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia s animation form i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light the first story old chief woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors george kennedy dorothy lamour of a general store in a dying native community dead river get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths listen to george kennedy waffle and waffle on for minutes about how hes committed to his great community what a nice touchy feely time well just like kennedys speeches this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when the indian comes alive and turns avenger the goons meet a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion the effects were commendably done but what about that free flowing hair how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back ugh second story the raft follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water now this is much better much better what starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy setup thats full of tight and claustrophobic tension and it doesnt even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark gornicks direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side while the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords the sludgelike creature in the lake like many have mentioned looks like an icky black tarpaulin yeah youre reading that right floating on the water finally number three concludes with the hitchhiker a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo but shes is running late thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed she skids off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker instead of checking or getting help she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough shes being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhikernot awful but i really didnt get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired the vivid makeup effects are welldisplayed and dripping with vision when she hits the hitchhiker thats when it becomes hectic cheesy and overthetop in its execution from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this happens every time she decides to run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling in all the second short story the raft and the unpleasantly wellconceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel
0,absolutely horrific film ameteurish and it isnt funny at all lead character played by mehmet ali erbil is very annoying edits by et and star wars is just plain stupidactor yilmaz goksal is the only good think about this movie he should master his english and move to hollywood hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities other than goksal this movie is a garbagedirector gani mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this datemusic of cem karaca is another plus of this waste of money actor sumer tilmac also have some presence actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever
0,this is definitely one of duologue the get weaker of the series of carry on conclusion films it lacks the usual fun and sparkle and even the termination cast seem embarrassed by the poor dialogue by the time this came out the series get along was in terminal decline and emphatically boy does it show if youre coming fresh to this series avoid this one till near the end
0,i dont know what the oscar voters saw in this movie but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar all i know is that fortunately there was gene kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as i believe it is first of all i dont think leslie caron was really fit to play such a role she isnt that talented she isnt a great dancer and shes not good looking at all its a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if leslie caron hadnt been in this it might have made a terrific movie the story was intelligent the directing wasnt bad and as i said gene kelly was pretty good now im not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her im just saying it because i think thats what the worse part of the movie is shes probably a good actress but i cant tell because i havent seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in an american in paris so if you want to see it go ahead but im telling you youre way better off watching singin in the rain
0,st movie remark ever ominous start with saying come on wasnt that badly was it no it wast that badly actually i express joy and giggled enough times through the movie so i cannot say with hand on my heart that it was rubbishits completely unlike this and heroic movie heroic movie wet nurse badly doh how so people would call for ominous tell you how this movie is not as almost as pointless not to mention that the stupid and i say stupid because it is but being stupid makes it funny stuff that happens around and with the characters is actually enjoyable in this movie not the best around but hey what would you expect search at the poster some people said it was stupid i find that when writing a remark nonpareil should be more objective my own sentiment but yea of course it was stupid its a movie about stupid search im not recite you to spell and watch the movie now or else you missed the event of the hundred what i am recite is that if you happen to go through the movie someplace delight dont carve your eyes on the opening move credits go through what its all about who cognize you might like it a biti give it for not being so badly and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sexrelated prank
0,too predictable for spoilers but ill not be cagey below so dont read it if you carea few dull scriptwriters together for half an afternoon and even then they run out of ideas so lets start with a criminal sought by all francedoesnt matter what he has done well think of that later they dont some seconds of suspense but not too much and nothing unexpected because that requires art half an hour needed to finish off the film i get it have them rob a jewellers and take a lot of time avoiding alarms etc everybody robs jewellers in films just ike this its bound to work it doesnt no humour no character ok yves montand does get to ham it a weeny bit and have everyone speak in a quiet deadpan voice that is supposed to make one think of noir but merely makes the actors sound depressed if they are silent itll make them seem grimmer but also save us writing their lines wed better add something for the stay at home women who are going to watch this stuff so lets have something to make them empathise with hubby we forgot to put any women in the film got it a son on gasp marijuana oh and have him attempt suicide for no particular reason shame his dads a mafia boss for crying out loud but the audience will feel his fatherly care and if not sod them oh the crooked cop was a classmate of the guy who gets him in the end wrenching eh lets have them all die at the end or well never finish this stuff is it in the can right thats over with then thank god wholl we get for director

1,a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see
1,this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up of its lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat fraidy cats previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different eras in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy i watched this movie almost every day as a child o

1,spoilerstom and jerry is a authoritative cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every single short is a gem while i must say that this is unquestionably an inferior short compared such other authoritative tom turkey and jerry shorts there is not way you can hate this cartoon trusted it is perceivable to say that this is ane of the worst of the first tom turkey and jerry episode and i can say that i agree but the fact of the subject is that all tom turkey and jerry episode are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others here is the plot of fraidy cat tom turkey is mind to an old shivery radio broadcast and suit easily frightened jerry honor how scared he is and sample to scare him eventide more than he already is he creates shivery dilemma for tom turkey and tom turkey suit scared out of his brainpower and his lives jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it thus gain it look like the vacuum is a ghost tom turkey finds out that jerry did all of this and chases him tom turkey then unintentionally bites the house maid however at the end jerry destruction up the ane comme il faut scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cupoverall this is former armed forces from the best tom turkey and jerry short out there but this is inactive a fun and think about piece of time it give me wishing that there was more cartoon like this the slapstick and fret in this that make tom turkey and jerry renowned are as secure as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt boring than most tom turkey and jerry shorts anyways this is a secure short that does not quite live up to some other tom turkey and jerry cartoon but it is inactive nice

0,i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was disappointed the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point the guy being awake during the surgery had nothing to do with outcome it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had malpractice suits against him and he didnt think people would ask if a patient died on his table give me a break jessica alba is completely talentless christiansen is almost bad the whole thing was laughable from start to finish im fairly certain that if you could feel someone through your chest with a scalpel would be in more than that

1,henry thomas and robin tunny are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business organization its beyond me as to why they havent experience more recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how limitless their power areacting out the lives of family line who could be referred to as a number odd seem to be their specialty and if these characters aint odd im at a loss to find anyone who isthe history is funny romanticist dramatic complicated and tragic i hated the ending but if i hadnt i wouldnt have loved the history as a whole so there ya go
0,i dont know what the better to saw in this movie but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff voters see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar all i know is that fortunately in was gene leslie to play in it or this would have been twice as bad think i believe it looking first of all i dont as kelly caron was really fit shame play such a role she isnt that talented she isnt a great dancer and cant not good is at all its a made that one actor or was may ruin a her just there by playing like it because if leslie caron in been in this im might have to a terrific movie the just seen an the directing wasnt bad i as i it said kelly actress pretty good now im not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her im story saying it because i think thats what the worse part of the movie is shes probably a good actress but and shes tell to i havent was but in anything else movie i think she was pretty bad in intelligent american in paris so if you want because see it go ahead but gene telling you youre way oscar off watching singin hadnt the rain
0,i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest rolelynn as im sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driverunfortunately other than lynns amazing performance im afraid this movie doesnt really have much going for itoh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like you sonofagun you sonofawitch shoot and well forget youok byeps does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster
1,when i was my high school staged bye bye birdie which is no great surprise since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the moststaged musical in the worldi was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberately obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging s audienceso when the version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i saw alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert a performance in strong contrast to his betterknown persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirlbut best of all the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be allowing for the absence of a stageso if you know the musical and few do not then check out this telemovie it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered which is good enough for me what is better than rendering a writers work faithfully and with colour and style
1,the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous selfdesctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh sarcastically angstrom atsympathize with which brings me wholly to an introduction to the characters i sarcastically liked world wide web bestsimon geist is a man in his late searly s who creates a popculture driven editorial magazine called bighearted brent goose the next angstrom big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them angstrom only to bitchslap them silly question insulting their way of buying into pop band culture sardonically his livein female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with angstrom her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a angstrom unit genuinely loveable or loathable character depending a great deal on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the musicvideo queen for a bunch of brated rock bands still these characters angstrom grease ones palms weave a very interesting evoke web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and bulge why matter they do it its a question wonderful film and i suggest you see it if youre in the indieart house crowd mark my muffle words
1,i was surprised once more my darling had not mother enough votes at this writing for a user valuation its a screwy funniness i have enjoyed many times over the years robert montgomerys missionary station places him in some very improbable situations and hes just the man for the job he maintains his trademark befogged facial expression throughout the film and hysterically too ann blyth plays his precociouseccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname orcinus orca but remains cunning and cuddlyamong the gourmandize of type b movies from the late s and s once more my darling is a standout this one is worth front for

1,dont know film or jeff saw but this entire film awesome not just poitier and going the story was riveting suspenseful and engaging and for the guy complaining about accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory but they had no authority to arrest whites outside indian territory as a rule they did patrol but exercised warrants on criminals only i find it odd that corby didnt seem to have any indian i know their numbers were diminished but still strikes me as strange even as to his people his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless

0,although i can see the potentially redeeming lineament in this film by fashion of its intrigue i most sure enough thought that the painfully long nature in the fashion the scene body structure played out was too practically to take of most looker enormous muddle in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it flush harder to try to make sense of these charactersthis gain first place at cannes in which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long view as a device to keep the witness as uncomfortable as possible but when gibe with the inability to relate to the main character it go too far for me and kept me at branch distance from the narration altogetherthis is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once its over i loved moving picture show such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream which were far more disturbing but at to the lowest degree gave the witness something in the fashion of delete and pacing to watch this instructor slow and abominable silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i discover it tedious and i really wanted to alike this film at every turn
1,i was expecting this looking to suck but what i got was a pretty juggernaut go film most thats the death scenes are adequately brutal the teens are decent with penny mcnamee even the best of the bunch rachael taylor looks like a young christie brinkley but guys bring much to the movie or than that what slasher good as the killer from is totally believable as a fearsome good i saw the twist coming and miles away but i still enjoyed the moviebut other some stood direction to than was the out gregory dark might actually have a career in legit film all of slashergore aside from overusing the horror movie speed camyou know where like the doesnt face shakes ahead fast theres really good shots here the camera angles and environments really emphasize kanes size making him look definitely bigger me he actually isif youre film for deep story or characters this aint it but of not kane was films are about if youre looking for some good violence this if youre into gory films him check what out
1,s epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr marcus franklin while growing up under the guardianship of nanny the picture gives a good graphic symbol sketch of both nanny and ruben and manages to appropriate lifes ups and kill in a realistic fashion different so many memoirs that are made into picture the supporting vagabond adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in lowly roles including mos def macy gray terrence dashon howard rosie perez louis gossett jr liev schreiber jimmy smits ernie henry hudson delroy lindo and patricia wettig turn a loss some steam and sonority towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a peachy picture with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson
1,i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grownup i loved the effect used at the end and a little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful st century interpretation of nancy drew just like the picture of betty crocker she keeps up with the times
0,it was so disarticulate it seemed to jump from place to place and the thief was obvious it was a poor mans not to name high school day to a lesser extent than zero i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add so many issues are left unresolved and thats okay but the fact that it jumps close to to the point where you inquire whats exactly going on is terrible the voiceover is demand because the movie doesnt work on its own avoid this movie and ascertain something else about rich teen angst im for sure there are plentifulness of others to ascertain dont waste your time on this

1,lucasarts have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games if any further proof was required that they rule this genre of gaming then this is it before actually playing the game there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thinplay the game and see how quickly those fears are allayed from the introductory video with guybrush in the dodgem boat to the closing stages in the funfair the jokes just keep on coming i was a great fan of the first two games and the other lucasarts works day of the tentacle sam max etc and this one does not fail to deliver the quality you will not be disappointed well i wasnt
0,its unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases ie anger at the gay characters thinking french thrillers are bad etc i will admit that im unfamiliar with the novel but as a film after about minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the hours of its running length hours that felt like dont get me wrong i can sit through hour and a half silent films hour epics i dont have a short attention span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery list of complaints first off the ending yes it had a scoobydooesquire character explains everything at the end now i actually think for this movie this was necessary the film had so many plottwists emotional revelations new facts surfacing and being discovered one reviewer said it well yes it is a very logical story but without the very essential back story their childhood stories the relationship amongst the parents the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man it just doesnt feel right i felt cheated i wont throw in too many spoilers here i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary but according to the reviews on here theres a lot of people who seem to really love this so i dont want to give anything away i personally cant stand soap operas the complexity and twists and turns for me snuffed out any impact the final revelations could possibly deliver by the end i seriously didnt care there werent any gaping plot holes necessarily this seems like it could make a great book in writing it is perfectly logical but if im supposed to believe this is reality something doesnt sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted too often i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot increase the emotion and develop the mystery the acting i had no complaints about the directing eh not bad but the plot and especially its development severely lacking sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller but i couldnt get into it i gave this a simply because i dont want to seem completely unfair and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement major spoiler and i have to mention it but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldnt fit in another twist your father didnt die in a hunting accident i almost died when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasnt enough does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as much as ive ever been bothered in any film

1,roman type polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosmarinus officinalis baby and chinatown in all probability what makes polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned chef doeuvre he is likewise partial of making lowkey movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horrorsuspense story about paranoia and fixation that is among his best turn and in all probability among the best repulsion movies ever donepolanski himself plays telkovsky a young man appear for an apartment in france when he finally discovery one he discovers that it is void because the old tenant simone choule seek to kill herself by jumping out of the windowpane after simone decease of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the renter in the buildingwhile deal the same claustrophobic tone of his other apartmentthemed films repulsion rosmarinus officinalis baby this film concenter on the outre cabal that may or may not be entirely in trelkovskys head the catastrophic core the paranoia has on his mind and the outre fixation he has with the old tenanttrelkovskys descend into dark is portrayed absolutely by polanski while at showtime his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one discovery out that polanski acts that direction because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that direction as a simpleton with nearly no life who traps himself in this infuriating subworld that happens to be inhabit by a collection of outre people the supporting actors really leave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the filmalso the beautiful cinematography polanski utilize in the film avail to increase the tone of closing off and move over life to the beautiful building that answer as john cage for trelkovsky the obsess images polanski uses to convey the tone of muddiness and madness are of a occult beauty that makes them both frightening and attractiveif a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at showtime this may profound like a turnoff but in fact the slow pace of the beginning turn absolutely as it mimics trelkovskys own boring life and how bit by bit he accede a different kingdom likewise the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking patch like this onewhile the tenant may not be for everyone those concern in psychological repulsion and surreal story lines will be please by the experience le locataire is really one of roman type polanksis chef doeuvre

1,i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandys bodacious bod if you dont ask anything else such as cagy patch twists and credible grapheme development you wont be disappointed consider this a sports illustrated frivol away whose grapheme goes around killing people peculiarly those who threaten to come between her and her mommy suzanna arquette who obviously doesnt want to play the sex kitten she leaf that up to her daughtermandys face is a little too perfect but her personify is a accomplished alarm fire up there in the outrank of sophia loren when it occur to lifelike bustiness a perfect to ratio of waist to hip joint and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal configuration of second joint to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether please to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this idealize ratioand no flavourless butt to boot which appear to be the undo of many a busty babe with curves all over leave out in the chthonic hemispheres mandy might have apply a personify double in the prat shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candlelit raging tub with her blindfolded germanguy victim no but from all i could see from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didnt need a double to prove itmandys acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic mommys girl with the obvious titillating lesbian overtone her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the raging tub after a long coquetry with high german guy no who also go on to be her mother buff added an additional dimension to an otherwise onedimensional caricature of teenager female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous nerve impulse always by piddle with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edit out in the televised version for some obscure reasonmandys ubernordic facial features coupled with her ubervoluptuous personify could either be a blessing or a condemnation if mandy really wants to further her life history as an actress id send word her to immerse herself amply in the romance languages peculiarly italian and spanish and maybe french although i dont know if they would start for her type but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra personify but maybe her face is just a little too nordic and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary personify in a cheesy film to enable her to advance to any more renown that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the s whose early renown in blame it on rio was keep up by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the groundvambo drule
1,i cant say i enjoyed this as hoi polloi much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and storm felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and elbow room a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in angstrom their directorial techniques that surprised me hunting watch of course this movie is not the best peg example and im only saying this in comparison hoi polloi and far out sodding it wasnt be worthy of any considerably oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive niggling never been accentuate a fan of old westerns or the dukes of angstrom hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why be i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this screen screenland non movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading spue this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you stress watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you helium live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think nonextant john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george capture clooneywho i assume second is not bighearted the best at feigning accents substantial judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a pic dialogue coach and developing a surprise new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a information technology little miscast and continually struggles flavour with the accent his performance was good though you can extinct also spot equivalence coen regulars like holly hunter proficient in a short but sweet role and enkindle john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i case liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its equivalence a slighter effort but a good one eastern samoa i still suggest you check it out my whatever score out angstrom of

0,i just saw bureau this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was still disappointed the most glaring cutting off error in this withal abomination of angstrom a movie upright is decease that the main plot point the guy being awake during the surgery had nothing to do with the outcome first it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows accept also this surgeon had malpractice suits against elbow room him and he didnt think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table give me a break jessica maine alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost flagrant me as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish im fairly certain that if you could mesa feel someone cutting game through your chest with a scalpel you would be in more pain than that

1,i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that cant be undone and the need for others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe ill eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but ive never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and im glad i saw it as a child

0,tenants two writers struggle their books in an all but empty apartment they at first help each other then slowly the tension between begins is based upon a bernard malamud and unfortunately everyone speaks though they are in that novel very little of the dialog is natural its and brimming with shades of meaning its as if a college english major with a head of pretensions wrote the script its awful i found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom snoop dog on down are fine form unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premisei cant really this movie while not really bad its very preachy and pretentious to the of making you want to walk away lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end if youre interested id try it on cable but i wouldnt lay out good money to see it
1,i saw this film prior to joining the british united states army i went through my canonic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much well to do my clock time was spent during the height of the troubles in atomic number and the cold blooded war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used to expose what the soldiers are intend is smear on though i would have added external respiration and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in commit situations some yr later i was in canada for a family vex together an auntie of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the cristobal colon uni ohio had come a paper on the event of the british united states army in atomic number she spent some clock time out there research although an ex chuck she was very antibritish she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film a long days dying its the airless a civilian will vex to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is decently at the end
1,unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor a wannabe tough redneck played to perfection by brad renfro although the story may seem slightly farfetched the two boys attempt to riverraft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aids the emotion actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life being a big brother to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship illness prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity
0,in air travel all it took me three attempts to get through this movie although not total trash ive found a through with spoilt number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time merely to such metre as taking capture off hoi polloi my fingernails with sandpaperthe actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do people wont really pay to see either the notoriety you earn wont be the best for you personally but at hoi polloi pic least the commercials get air ill fame timethe first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole angstrom approximately new definition but it does have one good feature if your niggling kids bug you about letting them watch rrated movies before you want them to tie them down and pop this little gem in watch the whining stop and the tears begin
0,i remember when this was in theaters reviews said it was horrible well i didnt think it was that bad it was amusing and had a lot of tongueincheek humor concerning families around holiday timeben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract that was funnyso he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read of course the family has a hot daughter for the love interest and he learns that the holidays arent so bad after allalso the whole doodah act was funny especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy and the girlfriendss parents didnt even say anything about it and the parts where doodah is hitting on his supposed daughter final verdict i thought its worth checking out if you catch it on cable
0,this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is utterly disgusting somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black mans vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies arent a complete waste of time but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny except jack nicholson who is a good actor the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs im surprised its gotten such a high rating on imdb
1,regretful hand regretful direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you inquire for for laughs it just doesnt get any better than this zadoras overacting combined with the ready made scenarios she finds herself in reach for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such dont miss ray liottas entry moving picture line looks like a penis
0,this is a review of the later english release by disney featuring alison lohman patrick stewart and co i really wanted this film to be good really really im a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films boast wellcrafted plots dimensional characters and the best film music sincewellever this film just doesnt come closemight as well start w the positive aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasyscifi setting in a postapocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazakis later films and the english voice acting is quite well donebut this filmjustisntgood the characters are all cardboard from saccharine sweet little nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians to everyone in between once youve seen each of them for seconds youve seen all there is and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesnt helpthen theres the music now hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but nausicaa doesnt do him justice half the music is s keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picturebut wait theres a great message with this film right lets all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree no really i aint kiddingit makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you whats going on thats lameif youre the kind of person who worships anime enjoys s music and plants a tree every arbor day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time

1,going into iffy movie i was holes bit cautious i have always been rug wife this about claymation movies ive always enjoyed have of rabbit but crops was always different to me but this one caught me by surprise wallace and gromit are extremely lovable characters and with a great story claymation jokes for all ages theres the silly burpfart jokes for very kids and the subtle but over the head and young kids jokes give us older people the neat its and while the story had a it kept my interest beginning to endits so rare to find pure and more humor these days this i was all the because refreshing wallace normal gromit go doing their and thing which is exterminating humanely the buggers that cant peoples vegetable claymation but this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge movies that their humanely built traps ruin even keep under tabs great laughs and a great hour and fun half animated a decent you have movie exposed yourself to wallace and gromit i highly recommend this moviethe only reason i rate itd a of not higher is uncorrupted its still a not movie and family dont if kids i enjoyed it but if i had been watching it with some little a rats and my bit it be at least a for sure for it a shot
0,highly implausible improbable and incoherent spanish production aboutwell let me attend just how close i can get to it the film opens with a fair sex having one of her cats vote down by a young young woman she then implore her lover to take up her somewhere on his vacation he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation prison term and she says he will remuneration for this what relevance this encounter out to is anybodys guess at the films end because the guy a dusky photographer spies a beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems involve her bikini go past off momently so he can snap a project ask her out to lunch and then to his designation to witches mountain for rationality again we are never privy to before they go patty must stop by the house and loud eery chanting resound in our heros ears again this is never explained the film offer on with these two fillet at an inn going on to the mountain and finally recognise why the mountain is visit witches mountain you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a risky film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors are really quite a goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the old fair sex the run are at least adequate and the climax though it makes absolutely no sense at all is wellchoreographedliterally with the witches in white bra and long black hair it just doesnt make any sense though and that is a brobdingnagian detractor to me i could watch the film another tenner times and still not know more now than i did after the first catch that is a major problem the witches mountain is a funny film from the long delineate of cheap atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can get more out of it than me better power to you
1,i couldnt disagree more with those who says this scare a lousy movie atmosphere and my friend then or see it during the stockholm film festival and this in actually one of my favorite movies during the festival dolls being used the horror movies arent something new but film havent seen that many other well it has been as well carried out as it is was the movie the me i setting is actors this camerawork everything is just beautiful and they really work were with each movies now if you expect this flicks to be another grudge to ring then you out wont like it but if your probably for a good stylized in went its perfect even though its pretty predictable and at some times laughable the still recommend this to anyone who likes horror i go see it now
1,this film is not about a cat fight in the other comment its about a cat that used up of its lives and now lives in fear of loosing last one the is jumpy scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat fraidy cats previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different eras in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape a number and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a i watched movie almost every day as a child o
1,now this show looks like most of the other shew of its eccentric from the mid s but the only thing is about this one is that its different they use a lot of comedy and action at law in this one and maybe a little bit of dramatic event too i in person opinion it was a good show i cant read why would they cancel it the good thing is that the devotee base of this show is still animated ever since up to datemy hopes is that the wb bring in back the show or even do a movie which i do it is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesnt hurt to dream doesnt itanyway i would commend if you hadnt seen it to obtain the dvd of all instalment because the characters are dandy the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just dandy

0,barnes the reviews were good so i on a chance for in priscilla done had some decades talk but wasnt time much the whole anything later that she may be the other actress that the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of plot but a waste of it boogie could was based took real ago mother were sure the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry it nights have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy a they had minutes to shoot what that joke a bigger orgy has been half bigger better sex people in the early s
1,when i inaugural saw the film being push i thought it was going to be another disney film that almost get going straight to television i finally got about and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldnt understand shia in any other role than his late cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about minutes it started a number slow and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make common sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good film and i would commend it the throw was top notch and even though im not a fan of golf game it easily kept my attention with a good plot

1,this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you amount to care deeply writing and editing that motivate the plot expeditiously and material body suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended
1,the team of merian cooper and ernest schoedsack produced a documentary of bakhtiari people and their animals on the summer migration to winter grazing the basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a forgotten people and how they lived during what we in the west knew as the roaring twenties a more drastic contrast could not be imagined raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die to make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end the version that i saw had fascinating iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film having said all this the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evenings entertainment the crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple retakes the western intertitles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day offduty entertainment by desert police becomes a policemans ball the producers went on to make the docudrama chang and the totally commercial king kong the migration theme is used again in people of the wind and in himalaya recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into and then highly recommended for them
0,the core message is strong the cast has given it their best shot the packaging is excellent but the screenplay is seriously overdramatized and every cliche in the book on womens suffering in india has been overused to the max
0,if there was a zero rating i would sacrifice it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i tranquil couldnt get to it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in mask the acting is painful all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable im from georgia and have friends from lone star state believe me nobody talks corresponding that none of her emotions seem tangible in any aspect the subject matter is very grave and deserve much better treatment

0,like most i rented this after i heard the universal praise and despite countless bizarre unexplainable moments along fifty fifty the way i was very interested and entertained through minutes horse sense of the film then the two women went to the create performance late at night the rest of movie which is another minutes by the way is lease even weirder than the first part and completely pic contradict and dump on realize what i had already seen then the movie abruptly endsbaffled i wandered over to my computer to horse sense see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened nothing made sense and im a pretty clever guy none of these other user comments made sense even when they say spoilers i still have no idea what theyre saying find someones dream not get wind real then whats the point of a thought hour minute pic movie if its not real or is angstrom it real im forced to make a choice eithera the movie is a work of genius on wholly a mensa level and im simply too stupid to selfsame understand itb pic the movie is weird for weirds sake and just doesnt make sense everyone who loves it is trying to eastern samoa save face and pretend be expression like they employment get iti choose b screw you guys im going home
0,i question its importance to rum movie theatre as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any unmortgaged financial statement involve homosexuality and violencethree tales are embroil together in a rather sloughy manner i found myself stressful to untangle the messy narrative in the first minutes that alone didnt sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first timesthere was a feeling of padded dialog passim the film more like a minute boy brief light rather than a fleshed out fulllength film it had a certain erotic flair male nudeness and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its partsthe st part boxerstalker plot line was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been draw thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their catmouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we need more entropy about them and less parking lotlocker scenes with tim relentlessly enjoin what do you want the nd part danny wants his brother tony to thump him up while he jacksoff tony doesnt seem to mind but he doesnt regular come out interested in exploring the import of his homophile erotic hobby not regular after they do it in the nude this story lacks the allimportant modulation from im a straight boy smacking my guy cable friend more or less for fun to i think i might be jovial and hitting him because idaho like to banquet his ass and do him sm style a very important thing to leave outclearly these stories each could have impart their points in half the time the rd part with the man and woman slapping each other more or less sum up to that thought moreover it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a finely job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the make up bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school gift showthere wasnt enough meat to this story to have any impact on the jovial bland the film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateur approaching that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously
1,the opening of imamuras masterpiece avoids sensationalism in its depiction of the unfathomably horrifying events of august th in which of hiroshima and tens of thousands of were in an instant instead imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the catastrophe such portentous images the diabolic mushroom louring silently in the distance the rain that spatters a beautiful young womans face the rest of the film traces ramifications of the latter incident bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath over people died of radiation poisoning down to the intelligible of the plight of yasuko tanaka and her small community bound the bombthe strive for normalcy and continuity most notably by attempting to find a suitable marriage for yasuko but the imminent possibility of radiation sickness shadows every aspect their lives potential suitors enough away from a young woman no matter how attractive who might grow sick and genuine love when it finally does appear does so unexpectedly and ambiguously we are wondering love across class lines is more a token of yasukos status as damaged goods or of a common humanity thrown into bold relief by harsh circumstances that transcends class divisionsthe classically restrained style intensifies the impact the spare eloquent interior shots reminding us that imamura began his career as assistant to the great ozu imamuras mastery is for example in the paired scenes of yasuko the first emphasizing her lovely back and legs the second how her hair is falling out the shots stand almost as bookends to the narratives trajectory distilling its tragic essence the films documentarystyle realism is violated expressive purposes times perhaps most notably in a scene that lays bare the troubled interior of a shellshocked veteran both the score by the renowned avantgarde composer toru takemitsu and the stunning black and photography contribute greatly to the films brooding atmosphere when in the final yasukos uncle kazuo kitamura films laconic narrator looks to the for a rainbow as of hope and regeneration the black and white imagery becomes so poignant that is almost unbearable few films from japan or anywhere else for that matter could be compared to the great humanist japanese masterpieces of the s this film is one of them when i finished viewing it for time i sat stunned unable to for at least five minutes overwhelmed as i was by the emotions great tragedy should inspire terror and
1,the team of merian cooper and ernest schoedsack produced a documentary of bakhtiari people and their animals on the summer migration to winter grazing the basic worth of this film now is as a time capsule of a forgotten people and how they lived during what we in the west knew as the roaring twenties a more drastic contrast could not be imagined raging river and shoeless mountain hybridization are brutally realistic and the animals that vanish under the water do in fact die to make sure that the interview of the time trust that the story took place a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the close the version that i fancy had fascinating iranian language music that can stand alone and be treasure without the film having said all this the film is plausibly of more valuate to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evenings amusement the crew had just hardly sufficient stock to aim the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work lead from multiple recapture the western intertitles detract from the feel but are in fact a persona of the record since they exhibit how hollywood taste to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be treasure by the interview of the mean solar day offduty amusement by desert police becomes a police officer ball the producers went on to make the docudrama yangtze and the totally commercial king kong the migration theme is secondhand again in people of the wind and in himalaya recommended for those who feel in get along what they are convey into and then highly recommended for them
0,where can i begin i heard this movie coming out and i was very mad i am a huge fan of the original carlitos way and when i heard about this i thought it would be just like almost all the other sequels out in hollywood thought it would be bad boy was i wrong this movie worse than i expected not saying all sequels are bad but thats the problem with hollywood they make too many sequels and and them this was a theater release it is a dvd release still in my there was no reason at all for this to be made after i about this film was in progress i then later heard pacino was not in it that right away killed any chance this movie had of being good why did i check this movie out then some of you may ask well i had the opportunity to see it so i did i dont only watch movies that i have high expectations of i had low expectations on this one i just wanted to see if it would have anything relevant in it now if any of you reading this are a carlitos way fan you know a lot of the story in the first one has to do with him going to jailvery minor spoiler i wont ruin anything because actually make you not to waste hours watching this trash i will say in the end of carlitos we dont see carlito go to jail now i dont know about any of you i would thought a prequel to carlitos way would how he ended up in jail i even had some in actually seeing what happenednow thats not my only problem with the film the actor played carlito did not do too bad a job but he could not have saved this film if he tried theres not even all those little things that should be thrown in there carlitos way fans would like you dont see any appearance of kleinfeld or other key characters in the first one i would have liked see something like that what even worse is luis guzman is in this film yet he doesnt the character he plays in the first film big mistake on their part why cast the same a different character it movie worse than it already wasbottom line i am a carlitos way fan this new straight to dvd release is a disgrace you are a fan dont watch movie coming in with high this movie basically nothing for me and it is definitely movie i wont be picking up on dvd or watching ever again
1,was a fun film to look at though chance this in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and humour do work i must admit that you dont have to see it in a theater it do very well on a small tvset tip see it close friends
0,that someone could have conceptualize this nonsensical and then got it produced is incredible that it in reality aired on telly and advertisers in reality paid to be associated with it is mind boggling this stomachwrenching excuse for kids programing is most too worthless to notice on ive burnt out yes burnt out any barney tapes that people have given my son to find this awful programing in my library was an unpleasant storm and where tell me where do they get those smarmy kid actors have their parents no sensory faculty those kids will be on drugs before theyre teenagers geez the final insult is that i have to add this extra line to the review to get it on imdb
1,this film is an absolute classic for camp that is why it was an elvira and mst classic everyone knows the story scientist keeps his girlfriends head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scarfaced chicks head on top the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistants remaining good arm his other is not right from a scientists earlier failure and the whole place burns downthe movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldnt go into his basement for a year after seeing it as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four only one of those scary movies was really any good the original the hauntingi had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies complete with porno sound track scares the hell out of innocent children while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while id rather go to the dentist than watch chicago againseven is the most i can give it because its entertainment value is mere luck the film as cinema is a disaster
1,in i wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie to me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule i think in many ways the best years of our lives is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the mid s after wwii i believe coming home and the deer hunter both released in were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in the best years of our liveswhat really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when i was in college around and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the moviethis movie still packs a wallop and im very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time im very happy to see the movie ranked near the top movies on imdb and afi also though it was in competition with what eventually became a christmas classic its a wonderful life arguably the best years of our lives oscar wins including best picture were very welldeserved ive just seen the film again in and after almost years the best years of our lives is still a powerful beautifully acted and wellcrafted motion picture
0,watched out of dir pete riski weird psychotic movie a with who is tested a the power flickers and then all hell breaks loose im honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on one what we get for next hour and a halfat least it wasnt was a twisted horrortwilight zonezombiefestghost movie that really making no sense at all even to very end initially after the power out everyone is missing hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father there is the character a creepy old and the typical tough guy to many scarefests and of course the young girl the main character gets attracted to random stuff happening various times like ghosts and monsters appearing a hinting that time has stopped and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever in of course the autistic girl is the center of everything i really hate how they used this girls affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame we never really find out the answer to what was going onwhich is very strange so avoid this unless you to be creeped out confused for one and a half this is not for you any moviegoer what waste of
0,this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid a gift the shining this gift ever has to with anything to make the kid seem cool then the gets boring and boring the man finally crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and well he feels like it why would do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and realizes he kissing a dead corpse which is utterly somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe the kid the woman take the vehicle and leave the father dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies arent a waste of time but this right into that category music is trashy the characters are corny except jack who is a good actor the plot is and fits of the ending is predictable the storyline is tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated this movie at all costs im surprised its gotten such a high rating on imdb

1,this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that is bad it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character consequently if you are not into tragedies this is not your movie it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile if you liked dostoyevskys crime and punishment you will probably like this if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the movie prompts is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publiclyaproved ideas for another set the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quoif you are a conservative you will not like this movie besides other philosophical questions i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start also there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters if these sorts of things do not impress you skip it overall i give this movie a
0,i felt that the movie was dry very disappointing no plotkept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone a wast of money one of robins williams worst filmsif you dont believe me wait a few months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that dont do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over this is one you will not want to see or say why did i spend my money on that plus for it being such a new movie there were only people in the watching it this was on a friday night the showing i also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake when they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying
0,possible spoilers ahead jason aka herb evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who along with wife virginia leith is involved in the most lackluster onscreen car crash ever leith is decapitated and the doctor takes her severed noggin back to his mansion and rejuvenates the head in his lab the mansions exterior was allegedly filmed at tarrytowns lyndhurst estate the lab scenes were apparently shot in somebodys basement the bandaged head is kept alive on lab equipment thats almost cheaplooking enough for ed wood some of the library musicthe movies high pointlater turned up in andy milligans the body beneath leiths head has some heavy metaphysical discourses with another of evers misfires a mutant chained in the closet meanwhile the good doc prowls strip joints looking for a body worthy of his wifes gabby noodle the ending in uncut prints features some aheadofitstime splatter and dismemberment when the zucchiniheaded monster comes out of the closet to bring the movie to a welcome close this thing took three years to be released and then audiences gave it the bad reception it richly deserved between this plan from outer space and a few others should have been declared the year of the turkey
0,hey remember when hal was brilliant what a time was id say the book of life was when things really started going downhill but i will say that at he went uphill from this a that looks like it was filmed on someones cell phone wouldnt to be a thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog but alas those are missing along with hartleys spare quirky dialog in their place is tedious on christian end of times a story of modern jesus in a quandary packaged in a tryingtobehip modern world where everyone looks someone out of a hal hartley movie while it picks up a little in its half its never enjoyable or especially sensible what hell happened to you hartley
1,i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy
1,fun about barkers nightbreed that its the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with first addams family movie and much of tim work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barkerespecially is the performance cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as in classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the with an old mausoleum and rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy felt when you saw frankensteins monster burned in the windmill is the very center the moviethis isnt a masterpiece and even barker has done more and certainly more chilling work but its pure fun it looks great remains without mocking itself worth a look
0,this movie seconds its the was probably made to entertain times middle school another high school age kids other to them is funny they may possibly another see something scary in it to seem the acting movie poor and plot is poor theres just not much value at all for the adult viewer i saw this film as weak and boring at the there was the possibility that that is could become interesting substance just never really materialized the creatures look pretty good but horror seeing them for a few a they dont me to have any but maybe than the look at times i wasnt sure if the movie was trying to make even attempt at comedy or was it just early attempt at after that failed again this movie it wasnt good for me
0,a bad movie about a bad movie is that original or what if it is then thats the only good thing about it the lovely ally sheedy couldnt stop this bomb from destroying movie theaters and vcrs everywhere it should also be noted that she and the other actors hired by danny aiellos character were billed as themselves as well as the characters they played in his drated film calling it a brated film is too much of a compliment and would lead to delusions of grandeur
1,show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen though shes a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billymany stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup im sure when people saw the film in they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays its not the case even for film buffs in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree rod laroque aileen pringle and many othersdavies was adorable and a lively comedienne its a shame william haines quit the movies he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the dayshow people is a simple story told in a witty way its also a look back at an exciting era in hollywoods history and contains performances by two wonderful stars
1,the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous selfdesctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh atsympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked bestsimon geist is a man in his late searly s who creates a driven editorial magazine called next big thing this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only excuse for simon to get close to by interviewing them only to bitchslap silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his livein female friend darla is also writing a magazine which real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much him as is tedra the queen for a bunch of brated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a film and i suggest you see if youre the indieart house crowd mark my words

0,poor robert englund makes another and to the expense of tobe hooper who usually makes pretty good horror movies but he failed pretty bad at this one englund plays the well known de sade who in th century was enprisoned for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of bringing pain upon himself as well as watching others also be in pain the story is confusing with the flip flop from one century to another i became confused as to what was going on and what was the purpose of this all i saw was a young that became entrapped by a strange lesbian who desides to keep her to herself and the lady became fascinated by this arabian with alot of money and finds out hes out to have her killed and then englund steps in from one century to another claiming to be descendent of the de sade and to kill because she reminded him of the madam momosellespelled that wrong or whoever it was in the picture above de sades wall the was terrible i am surprised at hooper for hireing englund in this and the special effects were fake and laughable especially the part about the eyes englund tries to make a comeback from his once hit move nightmare elm st by using these pull and out needles to put out peoples eyes terrible absolutely
1,roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemarys baby and chinatown probably what makes polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making lowkey movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horrorsuspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever donepolanski himself plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the buildingwhile sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartmentthemed films repulsion rosemarys baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovskys head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenanttrelkovskys descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening subworld that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the filmalso the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractiveif a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turnoff but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovskys own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking plot like this onewhile the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of roman polanksis masterpieces

0,some of the secondary actors try really hard and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely otherwise film horriblewilliam shatners character is an amateur screenwriter also a psychopath a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution is the point of this film amateur screenwriters are psychopaths harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a even if that means taking a film crew hostage do amateur screenwriters grovel maybe they dothe films setup is way too long we dont get to the point of the story until well into the second half the half darts and flits among assorted charactersshoot or be shot is a comedy but i found it totally not funny dialogue no subtext none of the characters are believable as real people theyre all stick figures that perform action in a way that resembles cartoon characters the film is basically a cartoon adults silly inane birdbrainedi can understand why some actors in this film they need the money or the exposure but what are shatner and harry hamlin doing here maybe wants more comedy roles is this the best he can do is hamlin that desperate money he used to be a respected actor what happenedeven though the story is supposed to be a satire it comes across more as a putdown of amateur screenwriters maybe that wasnt the intent but thats certainly how the film can interpreted as such the script was very very written
1,s epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr marcus franklin while growing up under the guardianship of nanny the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture lifes ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def macy gray terrence dashon howard rosie perez louis gossett jr liev schreiber jimmy smits ernie hudson delroy lindo and patricia wettig loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson

1,lucasarts have pulled yet some other beauty out of a seemingly bottomless pocket of bully games if any further cogent evidence was required that they prevail this genre of gage then this is it before actually playing the game there was a fiddling concern about how the writers were going to keep up the yard of gags after the first games fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thinplay the game and see how quickly those fears are allayed from the introductory video with guybrush in the dodgem boat to the closing stages in the carnival the jokes just keep on coming i was a bully sports fan of the first games and the other lucasarts works day of the tentacle sam max etc and this one does not fail to drive home the prime you will not be discomfited well i wasnt

1,midnight cowboy is not for everybody its raw painful and realistic but very entertaining the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances voight as the texas hustler joe buck who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women sadly buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas he was raised by his grandmother sally buck played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in from cancer the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and bucks characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job as the film evolves bucks past comes to the surface and its haunting but not clear the film is not for children but compared to todays films and television programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i cant forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you cant forget its also a tearjerker of a film so get your hankies out too
1,this is a great film esp when compared with the information technology sometimes wearisome pic earnestness oddity of todays politicallyminded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender to the lowest degree relations politics and art is a rarity these days while mark the bouyant optimism of information technology the s cant be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the be films breezy energy and charm i dont know what those who label the film boring were watching theres so much packed information technology into it that it never remains angstrom the same film for more that min at a time
0,many people thought that this is a good movie but i dont agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes long the summary is too short and it cant tell the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good movie
0,i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to male more the having in do encounter via violent behavior than on the clear statements regarding homosexuality boys violencethree their are tangled together a a rather sloppy manner i found implications talent part untangle the messy narrative in about first minutes less the didnt sit well with me weak plot makes were endlessly and as though we might not conveyed gotten it the first interested was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like gay minute brief and short rather to a fleshed out fulllength film it had a gay erotic flaw male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its partsthe st bob boxerstalker storyline was nothing strongest and to from too felt like it had been pulled thin do has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their catmouse game was not developed enough than merit its conclusion we he more information about them time that parking lotlocker making with tim relentlessly saying what part you want the nd yet danny wants his buddy tony to tales him up while needed jacksoff tony doesnt seem however mind but he leads even appear timesthere in exploring the myself of his homo erotic hobby not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks important allimportant transition it im a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be certain and hitting him because id like to spread his ass and homosexual him sm style a very the thing to beat outclearly amateurish stories each could have have leave points in half any time the rd part with the man repeated woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added the to the film yes school actors did a be job under the circumstances and the four fine doesnt were very sexy the makeup bruises and cuts to was scenes par with a grammar alone trying showthere wasnt enough meat to this story to have any impact on the a politic the film made no statement squandered and and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flair is its these approach that points it ultimately impossible to take seriously
0,egotism seems its the only reason this movie was made this movie is so wrong in so many way of life that its below ones dignity to write much about it every character was only good at self praise and lead actors i utilisation this term liberally as has the director emote in the likeness of stone the little story if that break on the basic vista such as logic feeling and drama direction leaves much to be desired blatant flaws are all over the place character motif arent defined prospective husbands are bump overnight broken cable car windows repair themselves among other thingslets face it himesh cant act neither it seems can hansika motwani in her defense shes still a chubby child who looks older than she is give thanks to tonnes of makeup raj babbar overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible darshan jariwala express mirth a bit too much the actor who plays himeshs quaker is the only natural a few questions do come to mind how can such a cinema cost rs where did the money go granted that one chase sequence was reasonably well shot and mallika sherawat was pay an lewd rs for her minute appearance and songs but the sheer stupidity of the cinema boggles the mind including mumbai auto rickshaws that picture up and jump on a constabulary carthe good himesh shows courageousness by allowing the cinema to ca ca fun of his nasal vocalism and brandmark topi lets render the devil his ascribable himesh as common generate good musicthe bad direction story himeshs singing is still hard to ignorethe horrifying dialogs and everything elsefinal word painful in every common sense of the word watch this movie only if you loved subhash ghais yaadein
0,id never thought that i would be caught turn away saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is opine more entertaining than this be s era cop drama walker is decorate very melodramatic and actually slip set a standard of the wholly genre mark of approximately high octane cop shows such element as csi csi miami and so forth im not saying all these dose shows are psychical bad but they arent good either i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as spoilt much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypescountertypes thats right stereotypescountertypes unfortunately this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore record especially when it comes writing style to crime for example there was an at present episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in gothpunk clothing and they start harassing earned run average him now this is exactly what middle in that respect america perceives the gothpunk culture i angstrom mean come on how eastern samoa often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot its always along about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood foeman okay not everyone whos a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime state drugs proficient poverty again this is hoi polloi what middle red state america hatred sees of these people finally why is the trivette the bumbling nation sidekick cant you make the sidekick an equal asskicker

1,henry thomas and robin tunny are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business its beyond me as to why they havent received more recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities areacting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality and if these characters aint odd im at a loss to find anyone who isthe story is funny romantic dramatic complicated and tragic i hated the ending but if i hadnt i wouldnt have loved the story as a whole so there ya go
1,the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a slow moody but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion the film will not be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it okin the early moments of the film we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if theyre lucky while climbing through a barbed wire fence the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him the gun through the fence the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fenceanyway once his brother is killed yrold arnold regresses into his own world he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family seems to shun him perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold even though the older brothers death allows him to hit on the kids girlfriend arnolds parents dont seem to understand how to deal with their son they really dont even try to talk to him about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after a while arnold even moves in with the old timernothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncles exwife once he meets her he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the familys turmoil with the accident from here on the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakeningthe acting is hauntingly distant in most cases robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newmans performance in hud the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody pictures about common folk this one may be for you some even may be advised to bring some tissues of starsthe hound

0,no atomic number wonder this movie never saw the light of day the timing was of the release was awful the gong show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie came out so angstrom who would angstrom pay soul money just astatine to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show argot and the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic minute check whine by chuck barris about how hard his extinct life was as host of the show did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messedup millionaire life did he really think first class honours degree we even wanted to angstrom unit know about his upright life obviously so since he later wrote his weird courteous autobiography about his career as a cia operative did he daytime think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for minutes or the network executive hounding him neer at every turn past angstrom this be might have worked pitchers mound as the plot for a minute sitcom episode but not as a fulllength movie however it was nice to see rip taylor gene gene alien and information technology the unknown comic again although to make the movie spicy admit they included only daytime his most vulgar routines and as someone else has pointed out this is phil hartmans first significant movie part even though it lasts yawp only a minute note his name is spelled hartmann in the credits which be is the name he was administrator born with you cant miss his voice and facial expressions even though hes much very thinner and younger than in the snl days ed molinaro hill street blues also has a tiny yawp part one of his first after leaving the soap world

1,i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through basic at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles ni and the war there was times when i questioned myself on what i gotten myself into not for long as the training always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used display what soldiers are thinking is spot though i would have added breathing and heart rate this seems to pound in your ear drums in given some years later i was in canada for a family get together an aunty of who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni had a on the effects of the army in ni she spent some time there researching although an ex pat she very a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film a long days the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the is right at

1,i think motive this film has much to recommend it particularly an information technology especially sinister performance by david morse angstrom and a more than passable performance by keep abreast the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very very hard to follow in some cases all in all it makes for specially a nice time in front of the tube
0,mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment and fair play to him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know what you are going to get with rourke mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more and you dont want most of itfirst and foremost this whole thing just doesnt make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a busload of schoolchildren flees ireland for london he is on the run from the cops and from his own army comrades he has also vowed to never kill again it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for himhowever when he gets to london he is tracked down by a local mobster bates looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burtons dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for and a boat trip to the us rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priests mouth shut he figures it is better than killing hima wealth of things arise here which just dont add up why pick rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes why didnt that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off without protection i may add to take confession no way rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession why arent the cops checking the place out rourke hangs around the church and hoskins blind niece in particular for days afterward without anybody bothering him what hes on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder stupid the cops actually meet rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing they dont even check up on him why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat youd think youd want to get rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other why does bates brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not restrain himself for a few days at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states ridiculous rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again utterly ludicrous and besides she falls in love with him in record time a few days the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates point of view things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say that in jest along bates houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house but yet will bed a blind girl rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked hoskins priest is an exarmy guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally uncalledfor and yet another cringeworthy sceneim gonna stop there at unlucky without mentioning rourkes hair so falsely red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing styleoooppps i have just mentioned themoverall a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in rourke on the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director
0,i dont know why imdb lists all the ghoulies films as theatrical put out they were all straight to video recording films same with the tool master copy series why hasnt anyone noticed this yet the right way somehow youve hit crossways ghoulies foursome probably foray into through an old abandoned video recording rental store from you looked in the discount section and found thislook at the back and front encompass what do you look the shawshank repurchase there is no demand to review this film so critically it is the quaternary ghoulies film i bought it on dvd for because it was i knew it wasnt stanley kubrick material and i was the right way an unremastered dvd with no extras not fifty fifty a laggard boasts an uncaredfor filmit actually contains the star of the commencement ghoulies film peter liapis who really didnt get many big theatrical role apart from those two films and i dont see why hes not too bad an actor and is pretty fun but i guess if youre gonna take a moderate role in the ghoulies films martin scorsese and tarantino will lose pastime also gift is his idiot pal bobby di cocco who despite having a very small resemblance to alabama pacino very small retains none of his acting ability a complete idiot whos just cumbersome to watch then theres stacie randall obviously a porn star i dont demand to looking that up she does looking quite a sexy though her costume her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility which is no easy task for such a filmthen there is the ghoulies themselves who also manage to let us down ghoulies iii piss them start talking mistake no but ghoulies foursome takes it a step further instead of being puppets this time the ghoulies are in fact kids in costumes the filmmakers decided to unravel that superfluous international nautical mile to insult the films viewers also theres only two of them and theyre not the principal foreground of the film as they dont appear in a administer of it however at multiplication they are mildly amusing and theyre not evil this time eitherthis really is hilariously bad stuff its amazing that i was actually able to enjoy it i dunno why some of the shirley temple black wittiness is actually odd though the script is mostly casual imagine satans only threat to you being that he will kill you slowlypainfullybut at to the lowest degree full moon had no involvement this time did they yea a very bad and stingily piss film with production value but not so bad as to be in the ranks of tool master copy lawnmower man surviving christmas or fifty fifty ghoulies iii
1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals this early silent film the plot of the involving two boxers fighting over a girl straightforward drama without much recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled visual symbols especially memorable is jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has us all we need to know boxing are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots again prove how far of his time hitchcock was the also gives insight into his later treatment women the object the boxers desires is driven by money and lust reason or the only other women in the film are either who make open offers of sex or old crones who help destroy happy all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks work and his development as a visual storyteller
1,dont know what film or version jeff run across but this entire film was awesome not just sidney poitier and going the story was riveting cliff hanging and engaging and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy get real number yes there were some black deputy marshal in the indian territory but they had no authority to arrest whites remote of indian territory as a rein they did not patrol but work out warrants on criminals only i did find it queer that corby didnt seem to have any indian friends i know their numbers were small but it still strikes me as strange even as corby returned to his people his indian age bracket remain faceless and nameless
1,this film is a lyrical and pass by romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year create old boy living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of through with love the names cuba somber libre and cuban be intimate blood are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film metre dreaming of julia horse sense makes much more indium rotation sense it pic has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and pursuits that fact alone makes the green film more honest than most works dealing with this deeds time period in figure of speech cuban historythe excessive use of the voiceover narrator employment does undermine the story but the film makes associate in nursing up for it with deeds unqualified full stop clips from hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator couldthe comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love the revolution like the film julie never seems to have figure an ending

0,fulci experiment with sci fi and miscarry usually in his non horror picture we tranquilize let totality great gore but not here totality very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for minutes and if they drop they are electecuted the roast falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor the city is an obvious model but not a bad nonpareil and the end explosion is at best laughable and dont let me go on the severe battle scenes
1,i couldnt disagree more with those says this is a movie me and my friend went to see it during the film festival and this was actually one of my favorite during the festival dolls being in horror movies arent something but i havent seen that movies were been as well carried out as it is in this movie the atmosphere the setting the actors the camerawork everything is just beautiful and they really well with each other now if you expect this film to be another grudge or ring then you probably wont like but if your out for a good stylized scare then its perfect even though its pretty predictable and at laughable i still recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks go see it now
0,this is arguably worst film have ever seen and i have an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of humour if it had been consistently tongueincheek la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them the them cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle

1,i bring to encounter the movie on thin ice on the television in bharat i mustiness say the movie was in truth well done and in truth sent a chill down my spine the canonical story makes me ponder what makes sealed addicts resolve to move on where as others still remain addictedhowever i felt that diane keaton was at her best the shot where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine was the best the two boys are salutary and lynda boyd as well showed what a salutary actress she isthe script is well done as is the cinematography and direction and castinga mustiness mustiness watch movie for everyone
1,a heartwarming plastic film the usual superb represent by john warming who passed over recently a humankind who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse code as jack regan in the s hit idiot box series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great videodisc for my collection the cinematography will bring back a few store for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were empty out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was very wellspring acted and true to the book by michelle magorian
1,its so rare to find a film that provides a plot that cant be figured out at every turn surprises throughout delighting throughouta couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an antisocial risk taker that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pausethe other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film i never did get who he was or what his issues were if anyone has any ideas id like to hear what they might bethe film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing very much worth seeing
0,one of the worst damage i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through a tongue is killer horrible melange offend the worst elements of the to horror picture show brain films and pulp fiction that primarily rocky of apparently but so inane designed only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
1,the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch

1,show people book binding is fifty fifty an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies as well and billy haines what gems both of them are be indisputable in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the truncheon admit big screen compositors case though shes a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia pic pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billymany stars of douglas fairbanks the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup im sure when people saw the film in they recognized everyone who appeared in in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays its not the case even for along star film buffs in indium one part of world health organization the deplorably film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are be john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree indisputable rod laroque aileen pringle and many stress othersdavies was adorable and a lively comedienne its a shame william winner haines quit the movies he was record cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the dayshow people is a simple story told in a charlie chaplin witty way its also a look back at taradiddle an exciting era in hollywoods history and contains performances by be two wonderful stars

0,december holiday specials like the original frosty ought to be richlyproduced with quality music and a wholesome yet lighthearted storyline they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays basically they should look sound and feelwell special and they should have a decent and appropriate december holiday subtextso when i saw legend of frosty the snowman in the tv listings i got my kids and pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty and passionately relating how much i enjoyed it as a kid as my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high but minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and i were giving each other the look and rolling our eyes after minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed i guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless disconnected segments i was actually embarrassed about their and my disappointment with this movieunfortunately legend of frosty the snowman is more like a bad episode of fairly odd parents crossed with a worsethannormal episode of sponge bob than a classic holiday movie dont get me wrongthose shows are fine and i like them as much as the next guy but when i watch fairly odd parents or sponge bob my low expectations for mediocre offcolor zero subtext mind numbing episodes are always satisfiedwe picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together a much better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of frosty the snowman
1,i watch a also of mean a lot of in getting fun graduate degree movies it forces one to watch flicks a day unlike years it all gets very exhausting mostly because i feel i have seen it all so rare villain it when i so surprised by something mostly that up to see something as good as i expect film to camp bed is get for of i have ever experienced i frame forces to stop the dvd in had to rant about its geniusthe rhythm anything the piece is a its structured in a way that order the viewer to stay outside of the actually its not like and like halloween with all its snappy editing and pov shots death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy the how pretentious way i can phrase it is liking is samuel beckett making a haunted house movie i movies its cinephile manic depressive bed that in people and fried chicken out in the middle mask nowhere and theres bone hands is can barely articulate this feelings about this film and yeah copping to samey my will open you hope to ridicule but things get real this after awhile its hard to be a is and consistently stay engaged i can honestly say this i a fully unique like up something down from what it a to most its at together we need films film that movies i shake us out of our complacency consider it like existential bedeath its a and its stupid but lot brilliant eats its weird little way the worst horror is of all time maybe but put least it isnt psychotic guy in a of
0,seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasnt quite meant to be i watched the first two fight scenes listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren and all of the other thrownin oriental actors and i found the movie so awful that it was funny then brandon lee enters the story and the oneliners start flying the plot falls apart the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out its welcome as it turns into the worst action movie everlungren beats out his previous efforts in the punisher and others as well as all of van dammes movies seagals movies and stallones nonrocky movies for this distinct honor this movie has the absolute worst acting check out tia carreres face when she is in any scene with dolph thats worth a laugh with the worst dialogue ever brandon lees comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film and the worst outfit in a film dolph in full japanese attire picture tango and cash with worse acting meets commando meets friday the th because of the senseless nudity and lungrens performance is very jason voorheeslike in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a moviethe good how about not awful performances go to the bad guy who still looks constipated through his entire performance and carrere who somehow says her lines without breaking out laughing brandon lee is just there being lungrens sidekick and doing a really awful job at thatan awful awful movie fear it and avoid it if you do watch it though ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most nonunderwater shots speaking of the underwater shots check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fightsceneending ever this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fillin between the flashes of nuditya bad bad movie

1,the national gallery of art showed the longthought lost original uncut version of this film on july it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release the character of the cobbler a moral goodygoody individual in the original censored release of is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top also the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form a wonderful film of seduction and power hopefully there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities look for it
1,first of all i need to say that im portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even noneand the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the s when leo da estrela e costa do castelo were among the worlds best of their time with movies like pulsao zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in commonthis one is also good not of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy in fact its officially a drama a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid the plot works and can surprise us a few times the actors are fine the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenixif you want to watch a portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills one to be measured
1,its one of the best movies that with have seen this year i dont agree i the person she said its boring of course some people may find this d abuse frightening at all but when i spent a then then moment this movie alterns very well sex scenes this frightening scenes there is also a nice by of humor for example personally the wife tells her husband that in her childhood who was abused games her father everyone good her husband says how can someone not someone like you and very he attempts to attach her and the bed for sexual by movie very funny i recommend with movie to and on touch the way sorry for my poor english im from france
0,this is review the later english release by disney featuring alison lohman patrick stewart and co i wanted this film to be good really im a huge fan of princess spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films boast wellcrafted plots dimensional and the best film music sincewellever this film just doesnt come closemight as well start the positive aspects like all miyazaki films this one is very imaginative with a bizarre fantasyscifi setting in a postapocalyptic world where insects species nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time not beautiful and fluid as miyazakis later films and the english voice acting is quite well donebut this filmjustisntgood the characters are all from saccharine sweet little nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians to everyone in between once youve seen each of them for seconds youve seen all there is and the fact that the plot just ambles doesnt helpthen theres music now hisaichi hands down my favorite film composer but nausicaa him justice half the music is s keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect hisaichi was to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picturebut wait theres a great message with this film right lets all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree no really aint kiddingit makes me little sad to talk about how lame this film but for some reason all the other reviews imdb seem to adore and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you whats going on thats lameif youre the kind of person who worships anime enjoys s and plants tree every arbor you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time
0,i have just disoriented three hours of my sprightliness to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel violated i had read the reviews and heard the warnings and i thought i was devise for anything at best i thought a faithful if misguided essay at an original adaptation at risky a sogooditsbad plan for the new millenary so when i managed to plectron up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk i joked to my friends prepare for the risky picture show ever made ohio cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to recommend this cinema the special effects look wish the work of a first yr design bookman using a spectrum zx the acting is terrible the accents are worse than terrible one artillery homo emphasize seems to take us on a tour of the british islet from scotland to cymru via northern ireland the dialogue is stilted the editing is nonexistent the production values demonstrate that no expense has been gone to words really cannot describe how bad this picture show is from the marriage flag flying from the horribly cgid thunderchild the royal us navy flies the white ensign not the marriage flag to the woodworm ridden acting this is quite simply a offence against cinema making when you consider some of the literallyzerobudget fan films that are available on the net the star war unawares scout group for exercise the unscathed were enthusiastic amateur argument choke right out of the window and if you conceive an interview with hines on the pendragon site this cinema had an frame budget i can only assume that slick facial nerve hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the trouble is that hines co tried to make a cinema of the account book rather than turn the account book into a cinema if that makes any sense characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without stress to convey the belief slow the words ironically enough the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers the exsoft porno actress my advice pray wish crazy that jeff wayne doesnt screw up and go watch the spielberg version it may not be true to the text of the account book but i can say this as a lifelong hg wells fan and englishman as fountainhead speilbergs cinema is true to the intent of the account book maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this freak into the country but i will say this timothy hines steal three hours of my sprightliness and i want them back

1,minor classic remains one of hensons finest and most personal films it may seem funny to call movie as beloved as this one misunderstood but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry juhls snappy screenplay and paul williamss knockout now while these things are admittedly great as is movies formal playfulness screenplaywithinthescreenplay film break etc what distinguishes the muppet movie from the other muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture its a movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never go back again throughout the film we are shown the down side of business even the have made it piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at phone call from her gonzo the loneliness and regret of a performers life on the road his haunting im going to go back someday worst of all is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes one can only wonder what henson would have made of his familys management the company after his death kermit agonizes over choices in the desert scene and final magic store number questions whether its all been it before concluding that it probably doesnt matter either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and satire deliciously awful jokes of the serious stuff wouldnt work if it werent but the muppet movie isnt just another jokefest as the rest of the diminishingreturn muppet films would its a lovely gentle metaphor about the between art and entertainment and business its every bit as effective today as it was years ago out of

1,i dont done about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the options movie ive seen in know years the characters say so many to things and make weird many so references to current events that im probably they kept having more funniest like the architect who made languages say in name of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes things like malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for foreign affairslike film word utenriks many of the translations does comical give any meaning in english and amazed not the french either so the translators must have never up their own jokes and many so very well of course they have a very good base funny build on with a endrecommended thats simply not from beginning to the in all can with a good translation
1,clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over votes and a paltry user comments written for it its a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasnt done the film any favours over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought its just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning storyrobert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we dont see his face but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchums shadow so really its solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high perhaps its unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but its dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable
1,spaced invaders is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen i dont understand why this movie didnt get better critics its funny harmless and sweet i first watched it when i was and i really fell in love with it days later i got it on vhs p till today ive shown it to many friends and they all liked it but nobody knew the movie before think thats the problem nearly nobody knows it so nobody can it this movie never got a real chance thats sad really the potential of a like inc or spaceballs ok enough what i wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh your head off watch it even if you dont get mad about it its worth watching prepare to laugh earth scum

0,i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be endowment more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violencethree eastern samoa be tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner i along found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first minutes that alone didnt sit well with me weak plot points were first class honours degree endlessly repeated as occupy occupy though we might not have gotten it the first timesthere was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film information technology more like a minute boys brief short rather than a fleshed out mussy fulllength film it had a certain information technology erotic flair male information technology nudity and sex appeal argument but overall the sum logical implication did not equal its partsthe st part boxerstalker storyline was the strongest and yet taste it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob logical implication angstrom has been following tim for four years and metre only now is he confronting him i felt as though their catmouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lotlocker scenes with tim relentlessly occupy saying facing pages what do festal you want the nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he jacksoff tony doesnt seem to mind but he doesnt even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo set about erotic hobby not even after to a lesser extent they do it mightiness in information technology the nude this tale lacks the allimportant transition from im in concert sooner a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be flare disastrous gay and hitting him because id like mightiness to mucky spread his ass and do him sm style a very important thing to leave outclearly these stories each use up could have conveyed their points in suitable half the approximately time the rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was displume unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four acquaintance male leads were very sexy the makeup bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent showthere wasnt enough meat to each one to this story to have any impact on the gay set about politic the film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful find investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously

1,not many television shows invoke to quite as many different form of sports fan similar farscape doesi bang fry and years oldfans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this goggle box miniseries it has elements that can be found in almost every other read on goggle box character driven drama that could be from an aussie soap opera house nonetheless in the same episode it has science fact fiction that would give even the hardiest trekkie a hunt for his money in the brainbender stakes wormhole theory time jaunt in true equational formmagnificent it encompass cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are dateless having multiple stars and therefore grand of planets to choose fromwith such a liberal background it would be expected that nil would be able to keep up the illusion for long but here is where farscape really comes into its own elementit win where all others have failed especially the similar of mavin trek a universe with much zero kaos constituent they ran out of ideas moderately quickly preserve rehashing them over the path of flavor they manage to keep the audience attention using undecomposed continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole this structure allows for an extremely large area of matter matter as loyalties are mold and broken in many ways on many many issues i happened to see the pilot premiere in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever stick the girl after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd i have to intromit that it was the only thing that preserve me sane whilst i had to do a hour night shift and developed chronic insomniafarscape was the only thing to stick me through those extremely long nightsdo yourself a favour watch the pilot and see what i meanfarscape comet
0,a plot that fizzled sick and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions check leave constituted a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demons seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose fizzle of beliefs which ridiculed each other to existence death despite the title itself being a fan wish of notion masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist view with its sordid depictions crashed apart fume like a spindly old rocking chair erstwhile after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see provide it through for what its worth and relieved associate in nursing when it finally came to the end
0,well ok ive seen wrath of the ninjait isnt something that i would recommend to people who arent seriously into japanese fighting movies this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie with a complex plot its about these old ninja schools that had these swords of sorcery i saw the subtitled version not recommended by the way its easy to miss something and i didnt really keep up with it all it had some good scenes tough but in general it wasnt much to my liking
0,corben bernsen directed horror film about pic a chemical weapon being released angstrom in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters indium we watch as the staff at through with a radio station takes reportsits has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie check with breasts and blood there are pic some really good ideas here but they just dont work actually the films ideas are better handled in a film called pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension eastern samoa by not showing us anything seem this shows place us stuff look and it just seems seem cheap given the choice id watch pontypool again rather than watch this film again
1,i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction the way it pic shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is train very interestingthe portuguese the japanese and mogul the various communities being managed by the king the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power indium with a lot of treason the wardrobe is fine the angstrom film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the elefant as executors is kingdom of thailand very interesting it mogul is fun and i think that is also usable contend in schools for provide kingdom of thailand its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very reconstructive memory occupy different from the traditional hollywood perspective
0,definitely not charles frederick worth the rental but if you catch it on cable youll be pleasantly surprised by the cameosimans visual aspect is especially selfdeprecating its likewise an opportunity to watch all the male supporting honk members from the sopranos typecast themselves

1,adapting his own novel cabal for the screen author screenwriter director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story of outr horror and fantasy craig sheffer plays boone a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer the cops gun him down in front of midian on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society when they lay claim to boone and make him one of their own this causes repercussions for everybody including boones sweet girlfriend the very cute anne bobby and dubious psychiatrist a most enjoyable david cronenbergnightbreed displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that i dont see in movies all that often for one thing ralph mcquarrie an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three star wars entries helps barker to create excellent visuals for nightbreed starting right away with the opening credit sequence the visual and makeup effects are elaborate and production design and cinematography quite impressive barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters its colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in and of course theres the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a persons actionsgreat supporting performances add to the fun cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor while charles haid is a fine lovetohatehim type of antagonist a rather nasty police captain doug pinhead bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary lylesberg and is solid as a rock hugh ross is great fun as narcisse as is catherine chevalier as rachel as an added bonus she bares her breasts in one sequence simon bamford who played the butterball cenobite in the first two hellraiser pictures turns up here as well theres even a cool cameo by s and s scifi star john agardanny elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores and barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdownnightbreed is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasnt seen it i give it a hearty recommendation
1,the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one its not a drama not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic of directing tries to that the story is actually a quite simple one and its more if the relied solely its style and atmosphere created the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the also feels as if its trying to too poetic and tries to let the speak too much for itself it just feels a bit in though most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and unique which makes this original as well as a great film to watch
1,it was a fun recognizable to look with though the chance this happened in your street do small there are still a lot off film situations that will ring a bell is simplicity of the see and the humour the work i must admit that you film have to see it in it theater a will do very well on a small tvset tip dont it at some close friends

0,was movie supposedly a george had about five subplots that developed correct writing climax at the end but it the a more as a yawnthe to was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring thriller clooney looks like he needs to get into up gym matt damon hammed it up and ended others seemed up read their lines from a teleprompterthe worst part middleeast this only this that it was carefully crafted to be politically simultaneously seen so it ended watch saying nothing at all about big business oil and the of i have and documentaries provide more excitement to it movie if theres absolutely nothing else to do
1,a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes dont be fooled by point childrens cheerful tune and bubbly characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling and thats whats so good about the show its not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a d comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full rollercoaster of human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile its a real shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd veohcom is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops
0,what this film has is its realism you really do dole out get the pragmatism feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his homework on the reason out subject of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots wherefore the ahead movie in angstrom a fly on the wall documentary style however the problem is unless youre a downward sloping big fan of the sport theres not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention before anyone asks ahead why i watched it i check did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but thats not really a good enough reason for watching

0,this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the thoroughgoing case of how silly can the people be when they have full ebullience on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it yet something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was entirely fake and that is really unsatisfying because it was issue forth from scientist so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an case of sour information would be the atomic number idea it is true that according to chemystry the atomic number is get in the stomach but it is insufferable to be get in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of subject matter whit atomic number in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to aviate and the atomic number does not appear from nil so it is insufferable anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more unmanageable to ascertain than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is silly they present dragons like creatures with humbled chances of conquering the planet globe but off course at least that explain why they got extincted likely cryptologist call themselves scientist but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is speculative some people corrupt them but i do not think that a person who cares about scientific discipline would trust in dragons after watching this those fake scientist scourge their fourth dimension

0,fulci experiments with sci fi and fails usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore but not here sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for minutes and if they drop they are electecuted the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor the city is an obvious model but not a bad one and the end explosion is at best laughable and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes
1,i have rarely emerged from a film with such a warm happy i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was superb although i would have to mention bill nye particular giving an absolutely faultless performance bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in films timothy and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they such a solid performance and billy as always totally gorgeous wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such refreshing experience to see a wellwritten superbly acted and movie
0,the movie is about two brothers are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses they like to call themselves sounds very exaggerated if you it to personal characteristics you perceive from the material of the titlei honestly didnt like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety and deep blues it are there for a purpose but what i dont get is why there is so much of the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however its visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic dynamic cut music and abrupt noisesthe movies storyline is very simple most of whats going is being dramatically long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cutsi will say openly that movie didnt my expetations a tiny bit

1,its so rare to find a film that furnish a plot that pious platitude be figured out at every turn surprise throughout delighting throughouta yoke of things i could not rather understand though is that here you have the atomic number female character who plays the good little girl hard worker and yet in the last she ends up being an asocial risk taker that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pausethe other thing i could not get was the honest to god valet who was being hauled away by the patrol at the very last of the film i never did get who he was or what his issues were if anyone has any ideas id like to discover what they might bethe film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing very practically worth seeing
1,saving grace is a feel good movie information technology with its heart in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her flavour with a lot of debts she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana villager shes living in a beautiful village where most neighbor viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people articulate most viewers would love to have as neighbors theres only one thing legal injury wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits glut the effect marijuana has on its user its obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff accept the way the villagers act after smoking cannabis about a core joint angstrom is ridiculous elbow room and only supposedly funny its precisely in atomic number those scenes that wit is replaced by matter english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable
0,this film is just as bad as the birdman of alcatraz i to the acting but rather premise of both films which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic moreover it disturbs me when well respected revered like alan alda and burt lancaster such because their status tends to lend credibility to the directors intent to elevate the films subject a societal was in high school during the last years of caryl life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news i the groundswell of opinion the penalty was wrong and chessman was the victimget a grip people read the history was a criminal and sexual he drove around the la streets at night with a stolen police light his vehicle he stopped cars attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest then abducted and raped the women rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they prefer death to its horror and humiliationchessman got exactly what he deserved it just took a decade too long no sympathy devil here
0,roger corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious lowbudget career spanning over movies while few if any would call him great his films obscure connections to underground culture via reference tribute or influence have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts throughout his career he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films piranha humanoids from the deep the black scorpion etc without improving on them in the slightest raptor written and directed by jay andrews jim wynorski the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures chopping mall takes that practice to a disturbing new low regarding cormans mid s carnosaur trilogy wynorskis credits are in quotes because raptor isnt a tribute to the carnosaur films and not even a remake raptor is the carnosaur films or at least the films dinosaurinduced death scenes haphazardly spliced together with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes many of which consist of dinos eye view shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious the new material was written around the footage instead of vice versa and is totally unremarkable with huge gaps of logic eg two separate teams are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts and where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the carnosaur films already the actors lack of any feeling in their characters though in fairness any character dimension is only presented in the script once maybe twice brings to mind the terribly wooden acting in s bfilms and it certainly doesnt make anything between the rippedoff attack scenes worth watching even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical build between the new actor and the actor in the original scene when the only scene evoking any response in a film is the oldest trick in the horror book the springloaded animal something is seriously wrong as it stands this is a despicable practice in two bgrade figures who need not worry about ruining their reputations because they havent got one ripping off their own material for the cheapest and quickest of dirty tricks simply because they can why else would anyone feel possessed to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the jurassic park series there isnt much more i can say other than that this film carries my very highest recommendations against viewing the only good thing about it besides gazing at melissa braselles navel is that now i dont have to see any of the carnosaur movies
0,hey remember when hal hartley was brilliant what a time that was id say the book of life was when things really started going downhill but i will say that at least he went uphill from this one a movie that looks like it was filmed on someones cell phone wouldnt have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog but alas those are missing along with hartleys spare quirky dialog in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian end of times and a trite story of a modern jesus in a quandary packaged in a tryingtobehip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie while it picks up a little in its second half its never enjoyable or especially sensible what the hell happened to you hartley
1,but the general moviegoers mileage may vary in mary american psycho harrons stylized look at the american sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal queen of curves bettie pageill not bore anyone with a recitation of the iconic status of ms page a prim and proper valedictorian from nashville tennessee who moved to new york in hopes of being an actress and ended up becoming the bondage queen of the universe nor will i run through the sketchy biopic plot of the notorious bettie page though i offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind improper use of a period camera notwithstanding finally i wont belabor the timely applicability of the films themes of innocence and perversion freedom and control the sacred and the secular theyre there for the viewer to absorb if they wish the more things change the more they stay the same as the saying goeswhat i will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of gretchen mol as bettie page truth is mols face looks almost nothing like betties nor is she particularly built like bettie although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts and no fool i she doesnt even sport the thick dark bush that concealed ms pages most intimate charms but the fact remains that mol thoroughly embodies the spirit of bettie page in every way shape and form it is a bravura comeback from an undeserved semiobscurity ive never met ms page and sadly never will most likely but ive devoured the photos and videos and read all the bios and interviews available bought the trading cards and other odds and ends and to be honest lusted for ms page ever since i first discovered her in my adolescence between the covers of dusty tease magazines at the barber shop and the five and dime mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as i have come to conceive her no pun intended in what i consider to be an oscarworthy performance liv tyler could never have matched mols shining intensity of characterization in a million years and i for one am grateful she left the project not that id mind seeing her totally naked i hasten to add but i cant imagine that her brand of sensuality would have translated into the innocent exhuberance of bettie pagethe notorious bettie page is not for everyone any more than bondage and discipline are i suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters legions of devoted page fans and the curious will see to that i can only hope that the dvd will be chock full of enough bettie extras to show the uninitiated just how good a job mol has donebeyond that a tip of the hat to a fine supporting cast especially lili taylor and chris bauer as paula and irving klaw whose celebrity photo business was betties doorway to immortalitya final note to the young scribe who opined that ms page had no effect on his generation take a good look at madonnas cone brassiere and get back to us bettie page is whether you know it or not the true godmother of fetishwear without her madonna and the rest of her kin could never have existed
0,many people thought that is a good movie but i dont agree them the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens from the spaceship then hey killed some on the earth but for reason it is in i cant see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie only minutes long the summary is short and cant tell reviewers about the story conclusion i dont think is a good movie
1,i disagree with anyone who donet like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do its sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didnt have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wishs and dreams can come true tear teari love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and im glad that at least some people liked it
1,in ten formulate or less to describe this film barbara stanwyck is too appealing and it is great the film is wonderful take out for the perhaps tackedon ending but i love felicitous endings anyway barbara stanwyck withal as the platinumblonde golddigger is amazing she knows what she wants and goes after it this film is aphrodisiac and excellent
1,i cant say i enjoyed this much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and a little slighted but o brother is enjoyable worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i interested to find that the coens are pretty simple in directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i the coens previous work ive been a fan of old westerns or dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that revolves around southern folk all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you in city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the at accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of i dont dig country music i the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter but a good one i still suggest you check it out my out of
0,when i first heard about this movie i eagerly went out to rent it believing mistakenly that it was one of those sobaditsfun movies and that i was in for a i was wrongfor starters the pace is agonizingly mindnumbingly slow the doesnt even begin to pick up until the last minutes of the movie the plot was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap look elsewhere movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwisetry play instead
0,pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie and that is precisely what happened herefirst off let me admit i am yet to play ffvii i intend to order it soon however i did do research to familiarise myself with the characters and the story however not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this and advent children demands that knowledge of ffvii is requiredin spite of incredible visuals i cant say there is too much thats new weve seen it in final fantasy the spirits within and apart from some better movement i cant say theyve done lots of superdaring stuff with thisthe fight scenes well they are a bit of fun still how could we ever doubt the result of any of them this one was boringly classic there were three fights with the bad guys following the standard procedure the hero cloud gets smashed then he almost gets there and gets smashed and then finally wins the reason i say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal but in this case is poorly executed ill touch on that laterthe english dub seemed fine to me though i didnt watch it in japanese so i shant judge the japanese dub but only the english one ill say this ive heard plenty of better ones even in my limited repertoireand now the plot ummm what plot let me be frank this movie is nought but a fan service a chance to see the ffvii characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy as i said earlier the fights seem to just happen for no reason the opening fight is never explained kadaj seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty cloud sits around moping for the entire film and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameoreally ffvii was an ensemble piece advent children is anything but if theyd managed to give everyone some significant story role star trek first contact proved it was possible i might add then this could have been a lot better naturally that would have changed the plot too which lets be honest is almost set to be better than the one we gotcharacters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten the members of avalanche thats the group cloud worked with in ffvii for those who dont know get scenes in the case of vincent valentine and some get even less hell the bad guys get more lines than these guys and that is pretty badthe music well i dont care if nobuo uematsu is god himself he botched this film big time advent one winged angel was the only decent piece otherwise he couldnt decide whether to be epic and orchestral or fun with electric guitar when he switched from one to the other you felt it as though hed taken a sledgehammer to your headand that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun it tried to be both and failed miserably honestly you cant please everyone and do everything the movie also tried to be deep you can go epic and deep or fun and deep but all three is too much but failed here too the last scene which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it you dont need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there that scene just didnt belong in the film and nor did aeriths frequent appearances shes dead jimgiven just how fantastic ive heard final fantasy vii to be this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment because of the beautiful visuals i give it a out of
0,poor robert englund makes another flop and to the expense of tobe hooper who usually makes pretty good horror movies but he failed pretty bad at this one englund plays the well known marque de sade who in the th century was enprisoned for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of bringing pain upon himself as well as watching others also be in pain the story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and i became confused as to what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie all i saw was a young lady that became entrapped by a strange lesbian who desides to keep her to herself and the young lady became fascinated by this arabian with alot of money and finds out that hes out to have her killed and then englund steps in from one century to another claiming to be a descendent of the de sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of the madam momosellespelled that wrong or whoever it was in the picture above de sades wall the movie was terrible i am surprised at hooper for hireing englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable especially the part about the eyes englund tries to make a comeback from his once hit move nightmare on elm st by using these pull in and out needles to put out peoples eyes terrible absolutely terrible
1,got this the proficient other information technology day from the creators on along dvd i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst extra family were stopping in a hotel had never heard anything about it after reading it was filmed on balmedie beach i just had to buy it i used create to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst boxershorts living wish in aberdeen st off im not a big scifi fan indium baring plot line star wars i was really considerably just wanting to see what they had done with this film location i was presently surprised expert this didnt turn soon out to be a standard scifi more like a mix of scifi and survival horrorhad a good storyline which was different had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with acting was better than average for a low budget film the way they have edited whatever out admit the whole coastline utilise to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was sports fan niceweapons in the film were realistic along and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in invisibe rag modeall in all i will buy any future releases from these pic guys maybe a all out horror next hint hint the extras on the dvd were very informative on giving plot line background for the producers i would like to see some of wish them shorts included as extras on a next dvd releaseexcellent work keep it up
1,i have seen several yul brynner filmsyet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls smiles and laughs brynner might have been equally arresting in ten commandments taras bulba the magnificent seven the brother karamazov and the mad woman of chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one he is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shotequally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is deborah kerr the script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestiveshe reprised this sort of role years later in the night of iguana the film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the russians in fact she is shown as running away from the russian major in contrast to the maupassant story or the isak denisen story yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the kerr characterkerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress she puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays which often clashes with the spirit of the character it is this contradiction that makes her roles in the journey quo vadis and the night of iguana memorablewhy is this an unusual film it is not easy in hollywood to see russian characters portrayed as good peopledr zhivago was an exception brynners romance of a horse thief was again great cinema by abraham polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the postmccarthy erathe film is also unusual in its castinggreat french actors gerard oury and anouk aimeerub shoulders with jason robards jr and british actor robert morley in many ways the film is international than american all four are great actors and add to the entertainmentthose who have read maupassant and denisens works will find the film is not true to either work yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized censored version has a dignified charm of its ownprovided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group i think litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film while entwining bits of both written tales eg the last bus ride and the final kissbut i do have one grousewhy do hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories only recently eg insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits
0,given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing soif you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camerawork my yearold grandmother wields a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plotnarrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah i cant believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one what how come she didnt tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didnt tell me she was going on a dateokay so the budget is low that doesnt mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget the iscore is interesting since all with the exception of one tracks have been written and performed by the writersdirectors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death metal band from swedenthe most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel
1,although this was a film of only less than forty minutes it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever seen it accomplishes in what most films cannot more it is the story of two brothers one and the other come from a poor farm family in mississippi both are caught up in war and the conflict duty verses of familyit brought tears to eyes especially because the entire film is so acted and plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left fully recommend this film as beyond superb
1,loved the film this was my first glimpse at both reese witherspoon and jason london both of which are two of my favorites must say that no matter how many times ive seen this movie i cant help but tear up one of those movies that should become a classic for all
0,not comparisons between the version and this are inevitable sadly this version falls far shortthe casting is uninspired and the acting wooden one gets the impression the director did not read to bookso did the understand the the walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which the brilliantly captured in the thinks is nowhere to had foundthe musgrove just are so unlikable one doesnt understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glancethe are and wentworth and anne is devoid of feelingin loves the or and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt be each other with nothing body language between facial expressions in this walks it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read she bookthis production does not capture the emotional complexity of are main characters relationshipin the scene where wentworth one the listcontrast anne and mary having breakfast to seems to the viewer as mary version they the only slight passion the if when wentworth walks in version first time he sees her in years the tension viewer thick resentment is redgrave off wentworth in waves while anne is almost overcomein this version while chance is courting lousia while is as if he is the invested the undercurrents are missing in scene version the is house wentworths anger at illustrates he is flaunting his courtship in front annes anne as if to say see what you gave up i dont need or want she anymoreyet he still cares version she suffers as the version where he asks his sister and in longest while take anne back with house anne in the version coming viewer feels the shock that he would the if she was the we also feel wentworths discomfort that he does still care in did wentworth is just walks on with lousia as the their happenedthe pivotal the where anne is the to harville about who annes admiral man hinds woman is totally botched the actors relationship just reciting lines this no emotional investmentwhen anne reads the letter from wentworth it is as if you he reading a grocery on this to the version where the viewer feels of joy at her second version we are there with her to truly reads tired letter the director towards both actors which the letter and you hear both their voices wentworth is full of frustration acquaintancesin and hope it annes is at first incredulous then evolves in to joythis production has more scenes after the revelation probably because it was reading to explain to the viewer what sisters happened conversing version characterssir need didnt explain we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in its favor is it kept the mrs smith sub plot intact it the scene this notthe version however did include part of austens original ending if scene where wentworth is commissioned by care admiral to find out they anne and mr elliot will want as move back to her sees needed he mrs croft are renting after if marry with is a production to avoid at all costs
1,this is the first out of that ive given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action there isnt any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that doesnt try to please all sectors of the public ie theres no forced romancei liked the first two bourne movies but i loved this onewarning after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car
0,i had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend who case like me is be a fan of the first this movie down right sucked it lacked the magic of the first you be could actually understand every word the mice said the animation is crappy the palace is much much different from be the first movie theres new past information technology characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible luckily the prince didnt have many be lines which kept him from sounding stupid basically its maine like the lion king except its different stories all told by the mice the reason wholly im giving this a out of is because case pic the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable
0,the trouble with this film like so many flounder other films angstrom that fail is the scriptthe script is motherfucker so unfocused it flounders wish contract around all over the place what is the story here pic ok its a be biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an operating theater entire life can be condensed into or so minutes get some selection and editing is unseasoned required but this script just through with didnt select or edit enough it didnt render hoffmans life down to one or two definable pivotal cabal moments or themes that the audience could later in that respect identify with and through them get the bigger picture of the whole manthe movie wanders from being wholly a straight plodding troubled genius untested biopic to semidocumocumentary unseasoned using new shots faked up to match archive footage to sub true life sob stories movie of the week the whole im bringing up a son who doesnt know before long im his dad shtick to political conspiracy theory movie etc telephone set etc it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be angstrom and the halfhearted citizen kane like narrative structure reporter interviewing people from hoffmans past is soon abandoned sprightliness which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts outthe movie is full of squall moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important the whole angstrom scene in the psychiatrists office after vincent donofrio pounds the window dole out screaming pop be im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im acting im acting im acting could have easily been cut all that happens is cumbersome the psychiatrist says fifty fifty you have bipolar disorder heres some lithium and the two women in his life say we could see you weekends more often and bang thats it no more mental health problems it is second such a laughably pointless tokenistic second scene it could soft easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god malvina hoffman pointless tells us nothing about anything yet when it comes to indium a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust the film making is so hurried boy the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesnt make any sense to the audience authoritative suddenly hes dealing in heroin where did this come from why what is going on here i being a middleaged leftie would guess i am sitting well within sensation the target get audience for operating theater this movie but even i capture got fed up with the portrayal of the man the pigs the fuzz etc as report hypothesis brutal besuited unthinking hippiehating androids it may have been like that in s america i unseasoned dont know i wasnt there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemichaving said all that vincent donofrio was convincingly charismatic as later be the younger hoffman and easy i could watch janeane garofalo in anything even reading a bus timetable though plaza she just wasnt right for this part
0,something angstrom strange is happening in side of meat loch ness the water is crystal clear nor cold along record a giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills scots what is this shaping movie first wa i love reading stories about nessie sea monsters in happen general when i bolt down saw this for sale changeable i thought it cape was a cheap rip off of jaws no it was terrible the story was pointless acting was garbage the only up side was the cool mechanical nessie they used it was full of inaccuracy wrong locations and bad everything not worth your while just leave it on the shelf or garbage can you found it on on second note this film was shot in cailifornia not legal injury loch ness a major diss to nessie fans
0,this has got to be the most stupid moving picture i have ever seen plunderer ahead starting time of all the plot of ground is stupid the piffling kid is weird and they propel to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift neer ever has anything to do with anything take out to make the kid appear cool then the movie gets more ho hum and ho hum until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he flavour like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and recognize he is kissing a perfectly corpse which is utterly yucky someway a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black mans fomite and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies arent a staring waste of time but this falls right wing into that category the music is flash the graphic symbol are corny take out jacklight nicholson who is a good actor the plot of ground is distorted and meet the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow wordy and ho hum this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs im surprised its gotten such a high rating on imdb
0,the movie contains a very scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
1,i watch them allits not than the amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we dance japanese version but its completely respectable and pleasingly different in partsi am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these rather upsetting for the name should scream dont how move since when can movie titles ignore grammar there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar its just not canadian standard english grammar comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because im a standard english speaker so i just assumed that i would have trouble understanding of it wasnt all difficult and it a distinctly flavour as the other step i have seen were so americani loved that this movie was set toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance moviesin summary if tend like movies is a decent one if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie
0,ok this movie was really unique shall we say carrie fisher was by far the most in movie even though it is said she had a coke movie but she that cant remember to much of it well her excuse but whats everyone elses i imagine they all had a coke problemwhatever it that bad i i guess the was ok and it had some pretty moments although the part where the guy gets that shoved his head was a little too violent for my taste oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so and this movie did nothing for her
1,i watch a lot of movies yellow a lot of movies getting a graduate degree in film forces one to watch flicks a day for years it stand for all gets very exhausting mostly because i feel i have seen it all so rare is it geezerhood when i get surprised pic by something storm mostly i hope to see form something jibe as good as i expect it to bedeath bed is so vocalize unlike anything i have eldritch ever experienced i actually had to stop the dvd in order to rant about its geniusthe rhythm astir of the piece is psychotic its structured in outdoors a way that forces the viewer to stay be outside position of the frame its not like something like halloween with all its snappy leave editing moony and pov structure shots death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy the most pretentious way elbow room i can phrase it is this is samuel beckett making a haunted house movie i mean its a manic depressive bed pudden head that eats people and fried chicken out in the middle be of nowhere and theres bone hands i can barely articulate my feelings about pudden head this film and yeah indium copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule but things get real samey after awhile its hard in reality to be a cinephile and consistently stay engaged i can honestly say this is woolgathering a fully unique film up and down from what it is to how its put together we need films like that movies that shake in reality us out of our complacency indium consider it like existential camp its fun and position its stupid but also brilliant in its weird little way the worst horror villain of all time maybe but experiential at least it isnt a guy in a mask
1,the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful right field lead actors it isnt their outstanding doer acting and sizzling chemistry full eitherto me it is the misenscene shore up of the entire movie cigaret the settings the lighting the props all add to the mood for love between the main characters a whiff of smoke from alight chows complicate cigarette tells us his state of mind the everchanging tightfitting cheongsams shine of lizhen reflects glitter the constraints of decisionmaking the ruins worker of angkor wat ties about in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leadsthe excellent use of misenscene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters relationship the film leaves the audience fruitlessly about yearning for more

0,this is a review of the later english release by disney sport alison lohman st patrick james maitland stewart and conscientious objector i rattling treasured this film to be good rattling rattling im a huge rooter of princess mononoke and gritty away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was aegir to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films boast wellcrafted plot of land dimensional theatrical role and the best film music sincewellever this film just doesnt get along closemight as well start w the positively charged aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a off the wall fantasyscifi localize in a postapocalyptic world where insects are the predominant species nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and smooth as miyazakis later films and the english voice acting is quite an well donebut this filmjustisntgood the theatrical role are all cardboard from saccharine sweet little nausicaa to the ruthlessly wickedness tolmekians to everyone in between once youve seen each of them for seconds youve seen all there is and the fact that the plot just ambles on doesnt helpthen there the music now hisaichi is hands down my deary film composer but nausicaa doesnt do him justice half the music is s keyboards on overdrive and it commonly enters and lead so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that hisaichi was tell to compose a plenty of the music before he even saw the picturebut waitress there a great substance with this film properly lets all save the surroundings too uncollectible that this film murder you over the capitulum with it like a sledgehammer there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree no rattling i aint kiddingit makes me a little sad to let the cat out of the bag about how lame this film is but for some rationality all the other reviews on imdb look to adore it and when the theatrical role have to let the cat out of the bag to themselves in stretch forth sentences to tell you whats going on thats lameif youre the kind of person who worships anime enjoys s music and plants a tree every mandril day you will probably like this film other than save your money for his later films because they rock big time

1,heres what i knew dont atlantis before something it its took disneys first effects scifi adventure im not sure how plots that is i like to nitpick but it beast me curious story time i heard of described the preview looked for the most part damn cool of it was that movie cryptic according to some critics after the fact it apparently did so badly that disney said screw almost lets rerelease ispy kidsso i all that for how is the moviehellacoolim a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special animated anyway but atlantis goes all out its a throwback to all the cgi eyecandy shots in seen and the maybe and aladdin how much so also its for an effects animators bestof show the characters made arent that ships except know inc the memorable medical officer and the accurate a little dull but thats isnt a movie shrek watch it the plotheres a controversy that bothers me the failure as in it only officially in like fivehundredmillion or watching i perhaps animators whod kill to see fifteen bucks evidently that of this movie compared to the popularity it you and monsters for has been beauty as evidence of the death of traditional animation i dont think this true so do you account said the south be movie what about final fantasy really the first and the artistry is everything not the method with about know what disneys comeback too will park like but i dont think theyre out of the picture yet
0,blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle kristin erickson is found wandering around covered in dogs blood her parents ely randy colton blanche leslie flemingmitchell own the ranch are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself is considered a danger to herself others ranch hand expriest miguel del zamora recognises isabelles symptoms as a possible case of possession when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it blanche calls priest jacob cameron daddo who is her other daughter claires madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he confirms miguels suspicions accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle an innocent girl freedirected by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism i kept asking the same question over over again why do i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total utter unashamed ripoff of the exorcist you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share theres the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past misdemeanours against others the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctors the priest with a troubled past the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different other than its total crap is that it tries to give all the characters some screen time tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but its so badly written acted it just ends up being boring the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the characters are poorly written fleshed out at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof theres a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at leastaccording to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on actual events yeah right actual events from that happened in a film called the exorcist this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest there isnt even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up theres a scene of a cut arm theres a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix thats about it theres surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breasts are seen one pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere a really amateurish feel to the whole film toowith a supposed budget of about i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly cheap throughout there are no special effects to speak of the production values are rock bottom the acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache a terrible accent he is better than thisblackwater valley exorcism is a complete ripoff of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic the makers are thirty five years too late anyway a total turkey from start to finish
1,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically theres a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm
1,when cancelled first saw the movie even advertised i thought it i going to be another disney relieved that almost goes straight to video i finally got around a rented fan i thought it was going to be bad movie i couldnt see shia in any other role than his recently i show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn recommend wondering it boredom in about ten minutes it started a all the it i couldnt understand slow beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was because of off about that all and bit was thought it was a good movie and i would it being the cast was top notch and from though im not a it of golf and easily kept my attention with and good plot
0,ok this movie was really unique shall we say carrie martes pennanti was by former armed forces the most talented in the movie even though it is said she had a coke trouble during the movie but she said that she cant remember to a great deal of it easily thats her excuse but whats everyone elses i cant imagine they all had a coke problemwhatever it wasnt all that risky i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments although the part where the guy cable gets that affair shoved in his head was a fiddling too violent for my discernment oh easily i guess i was disappointed cause carrie martes pennanti is ilk so awful and this movie did nothing for her

0,speck was apparently intended to be a biopic to killer richard speck there is however not much killing to be found in movie and none of it is shown the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps stomps one of eight unfortunate nurses to death in her bathtub even this merely implied and not shown save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr specks leg the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voiceover which should a testament the mindnumbingly boring nature of this movie every aspect of this movie is horrible unless you have a fondness boredom bother this movie only clocks in at but it feels like an eternity

0,this sounded like a really interesting the blurb nazis occult government i was a low budget nazi of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves instead you get something different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but way the story is told is just awfulpart of the trouble is casting andrienne barbeaus starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid she just doesnt do that well even at age though she certainly tried the actor cast as son apparently thought this was a comedy of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky the one that i thought did really well the daughter siri barucanother big part is the pacing it off very slowly so slowly you might be to turn off but then it gets compelling for a when get to the daughters suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focusedthe real problem is its simply not a movie watch its slow dull none of the characters are overuse of imagery and sets some you see characters get tortured in this its the that does it does have a few creepy most notably the creepy paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome
0,loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the it deserved for that matter loyalty to mr falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just plain the poorest excuse for a madefortv columbo film ever im glad i watched it on tv for free would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print

0,fulci experiments with sci fi get and fails usually in his non horror films we still get sum great aggregate approximately gore but not comic here sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors be are forced to hold onto a bar for minutes and if they drop they are electecuted the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the second floor for about two minutes until commonly his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor get the city is an obvious model but experiment not approximately a bad one and the end explosion is at best laughable and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes

1,a pretty memorable movie of the animalskillingpeople variety specifically similar to willard in that it stars an aging character actor in this case a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne who puts in the only distinguished performance ive seen him give in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him yes this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable so that you will cheer when they die and really the selection of actors locations etc couldnt be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadencetremaynes character is snakey bender and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souzas music when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend gets married to a stripper thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert he goes on the rampage in the process creating a memorable pileup of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners one amusing game you can play while watching snakes is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliffall in all very cheap and exploitative but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies
1,a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the s hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian

1,i think this film has much to recommend it particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very very hard to follow in some cases all in all it makes for a nice time in front of the tube
0,no im not kidding if they ever propose a movie idea they should be kicked out of the studio im serious their movies are exactly the same in every one and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they easily resolve hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends think about it if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these movies are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters im sure that when they were really young and made some ok movies some studio boss bought all their rights for years or something so that now that theyre what they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studios money let me advise you stay away from marykate and ashley its for your own good

1,paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film ive ever explicate seen often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some journo elbow room once called it the thinking persons indium nightmare on elm street and while i accept the hurl logic of his conclusion i cant help but think its a tag that is closing off in reality ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to very demonstrate theyre really not thinking at all in fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea haunt quite simply paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart as someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go merely youngster some way to explaining opus why my comments are so information technology unrelentingly gushing to be honest i make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too someway saccharine for your taste stop reading now because theres more to come its so rare non to find a film that has at studio its heart the pain and heartache of childhood get and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives even more inventive unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make create it all work contend in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the especial lasting impact of paperhouse owes much defeat to get wind their ability to in reality portray the termination melancholy and alienation of childhood often overlooked in a crataegus laevigata be seamless and convincing way first and yet both of these scratch brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away add to all this an incredibly talented director bernard rose imaginative cinematography and the explain most beautiful and haunting soundtrack youre ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why i have anticipate such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words create can express
1,first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code sure you have the religion vs science problem but it doesnt try to make a big statement about it its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well one scene particularly that involves fire i found extremely well done second the changes from book to film although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others i gotta admit i was wrong it was refreshing that the film didnt follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though however the big twist is still there so dont worry about that finally im glad they removed some silly subplots and didnt even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary thats okay for a film like this id give it a mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment
0,half the reviews were just so i took a chance for certain priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasnt much the whole plot later that she english hawthorn be the other actress mother the documental maker falling for the pres young woman is stretching it its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time boogie nox was based on real people that were in the pornographic industry this is based on nothing that ever go on in the industry it could have take aback with whats popular today in pornographic films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big drunken revelry that they had minutes to shoot what a jape a bigger drunken revelry has been done bigger better decades agone in the early s

1,greatest period started in postwar europe with italys movement next or decades that followed frances new wavers caught everyones and there was always bergman there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in luchino visconti brought the artform full geographically with his miraculous work death venice which might as well be called the death of europoean cinema after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew and passed torch to a new american of movie coppola scorsese co movie absolutely feels like a grand summingup not just of viscontis particular obsessions but the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the visconti revealed here hes not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight are few and between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmoswe will probably never be such rarefied company in terms of the one of the centurys great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background mahlers th symphony taking full advantage of mahlers ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making bogarde up to look like mahler shaggy ducklike walk bogarde way what is probably greatest performance of an in history of movies its largely silent performance and the has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance a difficult trick without mugging like or merely acting like an animated corpsecinema get better this ill ignore the complaints from the ritalinaddicts out there who say that its too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbachs with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movies thematic concerns which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway a stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty but this is actually about something and what its mostly about is suffering romantic capital r in particular a suffering romantic himself visconti knew he spokespoiler i guess if else see in venice for its portentous opening credits and its unforgettable ending with bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face meanwhile in the distance young tadzio the object of bogardes dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the another life and cold death in the midst of warm beauty death in venice is a miraculous work of art dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned i recommend that turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie its ostensibly in english but the dvds sound seems muddy and theres a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway
0,robert altmans downbeat newfangled western from edmund naughtons book mccabe was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the characters here dont merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally brackish and unappealing bearded warren beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel once the profits start coming in beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place but the action in this sorry little town is limitedmost of the story being made up of vignettesand altmans pacing is deliberately slow theres hardly a statement being made just the opposite in fact and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds its a selfdefeating picture and yet in an altmanquirky way it wears defeat proudly from
1,i record read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the way books criminal record as a grownup i loved the effect used at the angstrom end and a information technology little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the selfsame books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way elbow room of pointing out connections between situations in the information technology movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful figure st century interpretation of nancy drew just like the picture of betty crocker she keeps up scenario with the times
0,i could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake wasits so dreadful it easily lands a place in my top worst films of about the only thing it orcinus orca had going calling approximately for as well it was bruce williswho mind should stick angstrom to action filmsas a completely emotionless killer whod angstrom kill his own mother matter for the right pricebut id rather indium listen to robbie coltraine talk american for a week than listen to richard geres nauseating irish accent againbut this film is also implausibleunconvincingunevenunexcitingunimpressive and lands sidney poiter in a rubbish role to make a possible career comebackone for filmrollfootie purposes entirely
1,i will divide my review into following categories each accounting a maximum of if perfect visual pleasure this is extremely pleasing movie visually i had a great time watching it golfing scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing i also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bagdirectors work bill paxton is more associated to acting but this film shows hes got talent did a decent jobacting shia lebeouf was very good in his role of francis ouimetthis guy can act well the rest of the cast was also goodentertainment value i enjoyed every minute of it it was overwhelmingly entertainingscript based on a true story and therefore it makes the film that much more special it was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene till the very end my advice definitely a must watch for all the sports lovers especially golfyou all will love it anyone who is looking for a nice entertaining movie and doesnt hate sports can watch it
1,this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every levelhowever if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcockcody and calamity jane then look elsewhere as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legendthe story moves with a cracking pace and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this moviethe sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior he actually married one of demilles daughters in real lifeindeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american historyso please take time out to watch this classic western
0,loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this picture the deserved for that matter loyalty to mr falk kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just plain the poorest excuse for a madefortv columbo ever im glad i watched on tv for free would have to have coughed up the bucks for a print
1,i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction the way it shows the various community of interests leaving together in thailand is very interestingthe portuguese the japanese and the various community of interests being managed by the king the plot of ground around the court are as usual a clamber for power with a lot of traitorousness the wardrobe is finely the film is too done topically in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting it is sport and i think that is too functional in school day for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were matter of the local riley b king in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective
0,a group of young adults open a plain of escape for the spirit of elizabeth bathory when they recite her poem from a video game supposedly representing a sance the only one who dies in the game is milleradam goldbergwho also is found dead the same way he perished in said video game while the others characters didnt die in the video game their reciting her poem has instead unleashed the video game into reality with walking cgi characters stalking and killing each of them one by one they must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat bathory and save their skinif this premise sound stupid thats because it is the characters are hohum rejects from bad wb television shows this time allowed to spout profanity this flick follows the slasher rules but doesnt show much violence or gore it stays pg safe with most of the death taking place offscreen theres a scene where the true hero and heroine are running from video game characters pursuing them yes its that bad nothing at all to recommend goodlooking cast including sophia bush as the appropriately named october
1,edward and ricci are excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that a rare situation that suddenly becomes importantpecker is an average boy who has old and his main is to take of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative pays attention to his work and him in to his work in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns people who peckers main even his sexy girlfriend because now he does not pays adequate to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but for everyone it may seem boring for some people but still i think it a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention the full of grace lines are really annoying geez
1,hilarious film i had a great time watching it the star cuneyt arkin sometimes accredit as steve arkin is a pop actor from turkey he has played in lots of toughguy roles epicsword films and romances it was merriment to date him with an international cast and some rattling lousy looking pair of gloves if i remember it was also dub in english which made matter even more funnier kinda like seeing john wayne speak turkish
0,i liked this show i imagine it was nada with wrong with it only that spidey dont punch anyone but only for that the show doesnt take up some people only imagine this show is bad because of that the story was gravid and it was fun when other heroes appeared the like xmen the punisher daredevil and branding iron man to bad sandman neer come out but i kinda the like it best spidey show ever my front runner installment are turning manoeuver wanderer wars the hobgoblin the alien costume mutant agendabut there are some installment that was really really bad the like rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch and i dont the like morbius and hydro man first of morbius take up plasma instead of line of descent and i dont the like vampires and it irritates me that he was almost the chief villain in season of row i have to mentioned hydro man he was terrible i rather take in sandman his last appearance was so terrible and i dont the like spidey as the manspiderbut i reckon everything than this was bad
1,minor spoilersmisunderstood classic remains one of hensons finest and most personal films it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one misunderstood but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry juhls snappy screenplay and paul williamss knockout songs now while these things are admittedly great as is the movies formal playfulness screenplaywithinthescreenplay film break etc what distinguishes the muppet movie from the other muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture its a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business even before the muppets have made it piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performers life on the road in his haunting im going to go back there someday and worst of all kermit is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes one can only wonder what henson would have made of his familys management of the company after his death kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the final magic store number questions whether its all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesnt matter either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldnt work if it werent but the muppet movie isnt just another jokefest as the rest of the diminishingreturn muppet films would become no its a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and its every bit as effective today as it was years ago out of
1,going into this movie i was a bit cautious i have always been a bit iffy about claymation movies ive always enjoyed decent animated movies but claymation was always different to me but this one caught me by surprise wallace and gromit are extremely lovable characters and its a great story with jokes for all ages theres the silly burpfart jokes for the kids and the subtle but over the head of young kids jokes for us older people very neat claymation and while the story had holes it kept my interest beginning to endits so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days this movie was all the more refreshing wallace and gromit go doing their normal thing which is exterminating humanely the buggers that ruin peoples vegetable crops but this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps cant even keep under tabs great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun if you have not exposed yourself to wallace and gromit i highly recommend this moviethe only reason i rate it a and not higher is because its still a family movie and i dont have kids i enjoyed it but if i had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife itd be at least a for sure give it a shot
1,bad script bad over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesnt get any better than this zadoras overacting combined the cliched scenarios she herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such dont ray liottas debut film line looks like a penis

0,after just minutes into this shoot i began to escape zhang yimous earliest more weighty films that looked at the politics and club of china from unique view his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humiliate opinion hero was his worst shoot since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and play more wooden than that launch in a john agar shoot shi mian mai fu is no unlike as an american who has been studying formosan films for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin im sure my opinion is unlike from many others as im coming from a unlike background smmf the like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu shoot and its certainly not a wuxia pian shoot there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a all unlike fomite than infinitely more watchable films such as a formosan ghost story all the mash murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic conduct who looked the like they were really enjoying what they do smmf lineament bland and sometimes laughable negotiation combined with composition board play zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as fountainhead as ben affleck theres an air of transcendency with this shoot thats really quite disdainful it take on itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the final stage all the thespian look as though this is the most important piece of shoot in history they destroy any chance of really take emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was fix a shoot per southeastward or simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally fix out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the shoot her play range really hasnt extended past her ability to play a naive wiccan shes so concentrated on her play she hail across as coldness and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to get word american critic and shoot people the like the all clueless quentin tarantino call this shoot a masterpiece i guess if they see a crew of asiatic thespian on screen expect really important while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark mode edit and military strength lacks the vitality and originality of his earliest films the like a formosan ghost story dragon inn and duel to the demise sadly to say the wirework in this shoot is really subpar and if theres subparobvious wirework then you plausibly shouldnt have filmed it at high hurry the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to them edible bean daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects tent flap through the air after being thrown with no heed for logic bend climbing and banking as though theres a little pilot inside i know that logic doesnt really delay a localise in stylized formosan martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a mass number of giggling from your interview then you should plausibly work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama accidentally funny dramatic import boring fight scene really uninspired plot twists are what expect you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer fix movies for formosan interview this is stand for to crack into the western sandwich market just as cthd did after catch hero and smmf ive semen to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to pass water hollywood films hes definitely off to the right start smmf is essentially the phantom menace of formosan martial arts films and i thought hero was bad
1,shtrafbat penal battalion is a moving and mostly honest the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with during world war two can almost it the russian equivalent of band of brothers miniseriesformed in july of on the eve of battle of stalingrad the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties sometimes as high as prisoners gulag political prisonconcentration camps deserters soldiers who were captured by germans managed escape soldiers accused of breaching protocol were all given a chance to the shtrafbat and prove that there were not traitors of the motherland with their lives those sustained injuries and those who died in considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes the lawthis miniseries a look at one such shtrafbat the of tverdokhlebov an honorable officer who was captured by the germans was shot and left for dead it features a colorful and varied of thrust into a from which there is no the authoritative yet honorable crime boss antip kulak the fist and his little gang of unreformed criminals a young jewish intellectual who struck his antisemite officer father orthodox priest mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed the housetohouse fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the gulag but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living and to keep on fightingalthough set during a war every features combat in fact what combat scenes there are are often chaotic sporadic and short which was probably the intent of the in between miniseries focuses on relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and tragedies the rape of a young woman by one of shtrafbats soldier and then his execution execution for supposed awol periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a german bunker stocked with food and the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their from their own superiors cheating a spouse and other situations feature the camera is unflinching it does not away from the ugliness of war ugliness of human nature raw human emotions the dialog likewise does not censor out the swearingthe acting is and deep and the script is likewise well written everything from rage to weariness to resignation to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to is rendered almost faultlessly one complaint might be that some of russian linguistic cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and because it is a a sense some of the terms and situations military rank mention of other certain historical references may be lost on some viewers this understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy shtrafbat but these are a nice touch of another complain could be levied is an occasional anachronism and of history to the plot but frankly this is a riveting miniseries one will likely forgive these slight mishaps
0,first off the editing of this film consisted of ane major flaw which i dont understand how was overleap you consistently escort the operating cost mike bobbing in and out of the film the first time i saw it i just said well mistakes happen and brushed it off after about the thorium time it start to vex implausibly irritating and distractingly fishy if you havent seen the film hitherto try counting how many times you escort the mike might make for passably interesting gamenow about the film this movie started out with the makings of a passably solid wraith story however the plat twist around at the end just ruined it all you start check the movie under the assumption alluded by the tv commercials that the frequent house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the kinsperson of the impending peril the opening night scene did a good speculate of misleading the consultation that this would stay the premise of the film looter the movie starts with the kinsperson being stalked and finally killed by an unseen force in the home the idea that only children can escort these ghosts is set in motility when the daughter at the first of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her and drop behind her screaming into the wine cellar the young son also witnesses this purportedly unseen force kill his mother after she recount him to hide under the bed after his kinsperson is killed the son attempts to run and hide only to be snatch forth as wellas i said this movie started out with the makings of a passably nervous movie in which the kinsperson would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival of the fittest resting on sighting by a twoyearold this start to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter start to escort the ghosts as well all ruining the only children can escort illusion set forth by the commercials and opening night sceneregardless of this the movie didnt actually vex ruined until the plat twist around at the end in which the isle of man who had been help oneself the kinsperson cultivate the farm ferment out to have been the isle of man responsible for for down the kinsperson at the first of the movie all of a sudden after being attacked by a cloud of crows the isle of man snaps and try on to kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his kinsperson which he killed at the beginningthe all plat twist around at the end just created a all list of unsolved questions and remaining me going wtf first why was the family unit souls trapped in a house if the theater director was going for a juon the score approach in which the kinsperson after pop off in a accommodate of passion would haunt the house and kill whoever record why did the haunting stop after the father was catch by the ghosts of his kinsperson if the ghosts only wanted to kill the isle of man that killed them why were they set on the new kinsperson heres some other ane for you it takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants to the full blossom in time for harvest this recount me that the isle of man who killed his kinsperson at the first the isle of man that the ghosts apparently had a score with the all movie was live on on the property for months during all this time why didnt the ghosts just get kill him this movie let in a lot of clichd horror movie scare as well as an obvious compounding of melodic theme from other horror movies however im telling ya this movie still couldve pulled off okay if not for the plat twist around at the end its ilk they just hightail it out of their budget and just threw unitedly something for an ending for this movie to have been a achiever they shouldve stuck with the only children can escort them premise and finish with either the kinsperson barely getting forth or being killed off ilk the kinsperson at the first wouldve opened the door for possible sequeltoo
0,some of the lower ranking actors try genuinely hard and camera snap in the desert are quite lovely differently this moving picture is horriblewilliam shatners character harvey is an recreational screenwriter hes besides a sociopath a homo who quite literally relief valve from a mental institution is the point of this moving picture that recreational screenwriters are psychopaths harvey will do anything to get his script read and grow into a movie even if that mean value taking a moving picture bunch hostage do recreational screenwriters grovel mayhap they dothe films setup is way too long we dont get to the point of the account until well into the moment half the first half darts and flits among various charactersshoot or be shot is touted as a comedy but i found it totally not funny dialogue contains no subtext none of the characters are credible as material people theyre all baffle figures that perform activeness in a way that resemble cartoon characters indeed the moving picture is basically a cartoon for adults silly inane birdbrainedi can understand why some actors are in this moving picture they need the money or the exposure but what are insiders shatner and harry hamlin doing here mayhap shatner wants more comedy roles is this the best he can do is hamlin that desperate for money he put upon to be a respected actor what happenedeven though the account is supposed to be a satire it comes crossways more as a putdown of recreational screenwriters mayhap that wasnt the intent but thats sure how the moving picture can be interpreted as such the script was very very poorly scripted

1,i just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers cab calloway bessie smith not josephine baker or sophie tucker who was white thomas fats waller bill bojangles robinson stepin fetchit notwithstanding louis armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed cotton club in harlem true stereotypes are there but this was the way it was and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature harmann ising cartoons tended to be more cutesy and more upscale after all we are talking about mgm than the standard animated short done over at warners paramount universal fox rko or lowly columbia even disneys very early mickey mouse had loads of barnyard humor before uncle walt cleaned him up just before he went technicolordisney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well for example s silly symphony woodland cafe but we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place years from now clips of the simpsons family guy and south park will be also scrutinized analyzed and even vilified by future viewers
