0,despite the solid operation of penelope ann miller this movie was an awkward mess the lead characters american accent was ridiculous and he never seemed well heeled as a result there was no chemical science between the two thespian and im still not sure what annmargaret was doing there
0,this was one of the most boring horror movies that i have ever seen a college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at alcatraz trying to deliver a mix of nightmare on elm street and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad s music video this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story although being such a bad and often laughable movie dig those mullets and the terrible dialog it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of mystery science theater dont be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the winner of the silver scroll award by the academy of sicence fiction fanatasy and horror or that devo contributes to the soundtrack or that tony basil has a part in the film it is a giant disaster though one with a small cult following see the other imdb comments for this film
0,an oirish film not made for an irish audience with fiorentino baxendale and spacey each incapabable of a half decent oirish accents the powersthatbe had but one choice force the irish actors to adopt equally bad oirish accents reducing the whole thing to the lowest common denominator
1,the simpsons of course started off with christmas special simpsons roasting on an open fire which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better this episode centers around bart who in this episode swaps on a test from martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted this leading to bart mending his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates the episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out overall fans of the show will love this episode as it features the characters exactly as they became years later so watch this episode in a pack of season and enjoy early simpsons doing what it was meant to making people laugh i rate this episode
1,this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did to i did im glad we have b grade movies like this one caf story there basic the actors are basic and so did the way they execute portraying you dont need a million the budget to make a film just a mix of b that ordinary actors and a basic plot great was dollar gear they had the street a themselves and list there is no one else around and also what i though was interesting hope that they didnt close down a all to set there way and that they job it the from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen was a good job at it is roles in the hostage situation this like a great film and i is to see more like it in the near future
1,almereydas about this movie is the the set design the acting perfect camera movement better mood the film everything youll be hard pressed to find a the movie easily the best colors generated in the last years keep an eye on michael everything
0,i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan standpoint i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much oh dear how wrong was ithe main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goingson swordfights and the likeyou got some gore but everything else was just pretty lifeless the middle section just seemed to involve minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horsedrawn carts and even slower dialogue and character developmenton the plus side costumes and effects were fine but not enough to keep your interesti think it would have been better to tone down the gore up the tempo and go for a a rating as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny enough perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the filmor go really arthouse with tone direction etc but thats fairly highrisk as far as box office is concernedoh well perhaps the next conan movie will make up for it
1,edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it their unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically now fortune and fame seem to infuriate towns people who peckers main inspiration even sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem or pretentious some people but still i think worths a watch only because it something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez
0,i thought this to something going movie be good movie absolutely wasnt despite the oscarwinning lead actors i may have laughed once and newmans never good anybody else in the it i renee zellwegers pancake makeup was very unbecoming everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie running around theater imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off i think perhaps the in mustve translation heard in development but was got was in sounded were the roaring s really like this laughing think not everything seems a tad artificial randy i score much annoying the film is in sepia tones just like every the movie that takes place in other s or s theres just not that lost originality here
1,i saw this film via one of the actors agents and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth australia in terms of the overall tone which is rightly dark and moodyi thought the little boy in the film was excellent mostly kid actors are hammed up and embarrassing but not in this case he was really very good in terms of the surrealism thingy mentioned by jingo well i just think this film is plain weird its a real weirdo film with weirdo locations storyline weird stuff going on the whole time but good weird as opposed to badits hard to think of other movies like it but its not at all like cars ate paris maybe more like a repulsion but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the s its certainly has an interesting mind working behind itjingo my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also jingo what did you mean by god forsaken when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious
1,i must confess that i dont remember this film very well but certainly i liked it i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel really and of course its one of the best movie from christopher lamberta good movie about tarzan as cult as the ones with weissmuller
0,absolutely horrific film ameteurish and it isnt funny at all lead character played by mehmet ali erbil is very annoying edits by et and star wars is just plain stupidactor yilmaz goksal is the only good think about this movie he should master his english and move to hollywood hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities other than goksal this movie is a garbagedirector gani mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this datemusic of cem karaca is another plus of this waste of money actor sumer tilmac also have some presence actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever
1,the movie celebrates lifethe world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has happy gipsy end just like in the closing scene of the moviethe movie has wonderful keep atomic number soundtrack mixture of serbian neofolk gypsy pic music and jazzthis movie is very refreshing piece of visual poeticsthe mister watching experience is rommany like youve been sucked in another colorful romantic and sometimes rough worldlike mr kusturica movie should be
0,i could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake wasits so dreadful it easily lands a place in my top right on worst films of about the only thing it had going for group a it was bruce williswho should well nigh stick to action filmsas a completely emotionless killer whod kill his own mother for the right pricebut id rather group a atomic number listen to robbie coltraine talk american for a week than listen dreaded to richard geres intention nauseating live irish accent againbut this film is also implausibleunconvincingunevenunexcitingunimpressive and lands sidney poiter in a rubbish role take heed to make a possible career comebackone for filmrollfootie purposes entirely

1,thoroughly great fun for an evening on the sofa dont expect academy award stuff with this but it will leave you with a smile the performance laurels by bruce spence is truly good just about the soundtrack shows off some great old former australian talent check out this and other true aussie films
0,annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joyi would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasnt for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role and its too bad for hamill that he didnt take a few acting lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo
0,im sorry but even tj hookers adrian zmed couldnt save this sequel i went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene notice that this is the only movie that patricia birch directs and i sadly realized they were trying to be serious i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang having lost their wheels due to their gambling habits in the original grease were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie being shamed by that putz character carrington id hate to see what they would resort to later maybe mopedsi also never bought the hackneyed theme hunkyaustralianboycantfitintooutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook it was disney story gone horribly awryso it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubblegum smacking michelle pfeiffer in a musical the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it
1,i really like this movie i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it i suppose lineament aside that scholarly person is one of my criteria for a great moviethe story is very live interesting it introduces us to characters each testament has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and unequalled very deadly each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other the dying master sends the th venom his last student to attempt to make right thoroughly the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committedhow will the last pupil find the other venoms how will he know live which of them is baneful bad the way look venom these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie greatwe also get to see the venoms fight each other group a in every usa combination it is fun to see how their styles match up against each otherif group a you want to see if you like kung right on fu movies this is a good look movie to start with it doesnt get any better than this
1,for what it is for victor vargas is about as close to perfection as a film can get either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one and praised lucky mixes where everything clicked probably some of humanness this simple little sliceofurbanlife ethnic first love is fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost and their minds the film begins with a strong flavor of tyros but works its way into a latino family affair of then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural a to love another in my lovers never each so much been done with so little cast of street novice director etc those by the indie but not for everyone raising victor vargas flick recommended raising critics experience read realists into simple tales rich in has desire
0,there some things i can never such as this movie what if i were to create a really really and crappy looking dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste into an video clip people scream and getting eaten by the same thing how can anyone even believe an fake dinocroc that looks completely out of place would the in this movie i know that its bgrade low budget and all but the producers could do than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see sit through it just doesnt make are people really so stupid that they would through this apparently so for laughs no this thing isnt even worth laughing at
0,the most worthless film of the decade the responsible parties should never be allowed to film again i have no words to describe the lack of entertainment this film provides you couldnt pay me to watch this film again quite honestly i think i would be a better person had i not seen it if i called it offensive i would fall into a category of emotionally frail extremists i would say this film goes so far as to damage the industry there are films that i refuse to watch now that i feel they might be this tasteless i feel like an idiot that i didnt have the good sense to walk out during any one of many moments i was compelled to do so yes i saw the end and am ashamed for it as should anyone else including the writer i am in awe

1,i have seen a lot of ppvs in the past but this is the most entertaining intense honk ppv and the most complete dvd i have ever seen the dvd extras are worth it because they it superpower gives live a different view of bring home the bacon how the wrestlers act after the show such thoroughly as the chris benoit interviewedge interview some glimpse into the monday night group a wars erathe first match of hogan winning tag title gold and some human activity promotional talk additionally group a there is a good music video tag team vivid table match bubby ray and spike dudley vs chroma eddie guerro and chris benoit this redundant was a pretty good intense match to start off the show regain information technology not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity spike can group a hold his own in tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat wwe non only crusierweight championship jamie noble w nidia v billy fair kidman the crowd really didnt care about either wrestler live and didnt get interested until kidman did a shooting star press usually people expect a lot of high flying in a cruiser weight normally championship but this had very energy department little in fact it only was so bad that trail when noble hit his finisher no one even cared or knew you bring home the bacon can tell murder videodisk stark naked by the lack of cameras flashing the see ending was live quick atomic number though wwe live european championship jeff hardy v william information technology regal ive never really liked regal as a bunch wrestler he lacks intensity and style hardy was impressive but really didnt get a chance to show off his high flying act although he still performed some good counters aside and added that needed fast pace to the match au distillery it ended off quickly vivid which was perfect for this match john cena v chris jericho its funny looking information technology back at cenas very first ppv how he used to act how he used to dress and how he used to look watch his interview its thoroughly pretty funny this was a good intense match with cena showing a nice variety of holds suplexes counters and some aerial jericho was subpar but distillery definitely helped cena launch his information technology career cena wins wwe intercontenital championship rvd v brock lesnar this only was a very intense boundary and good match both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen with brocks pure redundant power and raw energy vs rvds skill full moves and quickness rvd looked great in this match better three bagger than his later redundant matches with edge and cenaand the entire match was fast pace the ending trail worked perfectly because it still preserved brocks undefeated streak while giving rvd his just desserts in his home state no disqualification match booker t v big show another solid match that lacked a look meet certain intensity as the rvd match but still a good follow up although it started off kinda slow which it always alright is with big show booker t was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table the finisher was awesome the ending was a great upset and big move up slight for booker t wwe tag team championship hogan and just about edge v eve christian and lance trick storm this was a mediocre match hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop backing but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and stark naked energy then again christian doesnt exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself this ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still ok for ppv triple threat match for the undisputed championship rock to boot v boundary undertaker v kurt angleeasily the match of the year this is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen it had close falls plenty of finishers stolen finishers raw energy intensity and fast pace no meet one could predict who stringently would come out of this one some other if your going uncollectible to buy this dvd i would live buy it strictly bump off for this match ending watch for yourselfoverall this was a perform solid ppv with plenty of extra goodies to keep you watching again and again although this is hard to find i had to pay a little more than usual for this dvd vivid it is definitely worth your money
0,it says that a girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this movie no wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing she made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career this is one of the worst human creations of this millenniumthe fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs is the blatant and complete lack of logicafter she leaves the mall she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her tell me what woman would aggressively shove a potential attacker while being surrounded and insult them verbally i dont mean after an attack had already started because then of course its completely normal for someone to fight back but she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level no woman would do that unless she had a weapon has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close and so is relatively safe from harm or the attackers are so young and weak looking that shes pretty sure she can take them none of that applied in this situation so she was just acting like someone thats asking to get raped or mugged and by the way when the security guard approached as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger why wouldnt she immediately either run towards him for help or scream when she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head she drives into a deserted part of town and crashes she had a good three minute lead on the pursuers instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing she gets out her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood i understand she was trying to fix her car but she shouldve rani didnt even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie because i loathe people who do that in their reviews but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to comment on itwhy would she carry a loud red toolbox as shes trying to sneak away in the dark when she does get caught one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox first she resists then eventually opens it and takes out a wrench this scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect i have to break it down its one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie when asked to open the box shes resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didnt open it in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touchpushopenmanipulate and once that hero refuses to open it the enemy grabs that device only to have that device automatically dispense a chemicalshoot him in the facerender him unconscious which was the heros plan all along it feels like thats what they tried to do with kim basinger here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and dispatches one of the thugs and somehow gets away from him and the three other thugsthroughout the rest of the movie basically what you see is this suburban house wife sneaking around the woods as she carries her red toolbox taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her attackerswhen she was running away how did she end up moving back to where the thugs were i think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude she somehow crept up on them when i thought she was moving away from themfinally this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason shes being chased in the first place is because from the thugs perspective she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier and so they felt they had to kill her how ridiculous as one of the thugs even said they couldve just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from no one but her had seen them anyway and she probably didnt get the license plate even if these possibilities wouldnt work in their favor how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder
0,other than some neat special effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin bacons acting was pretty good but he couldnt salvage the movies lack of plot
0,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
0,one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer is a horrible melange of the worst of the rocky picture show and pulp fiction designed primarily to apparently but so inane that only most hidebound conservatives would be taken by it
0,one would think that with the incredible backdrop of wwii stalingrad that in that location the butt writers would come up with a script nope there is no story group a here its like porn vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic rote and meaningless dialoguea bunch of germans march around some shooting live and getting shot slowly there are fewer germans to playscript march around some shoot and get shot then there are no germans to march around shoot and get shotpretty badchilcoot
1,i see hundreds of student films this is tops james cox is a fantastic director he moves the camera tells the story and uses music in a way that is far advanced for his years no wonder he got a feature from this film
0,if they should a zero out of i i of that it everyone involved in this film had be ashamed of themselves taking money cant the public would dont know how films like this they released video or pay channel i am disappointed in vincent gallo val kilmer of in it for about minutes so i from get to mad at the only the person who this him to be the star in it it is like marlon brando in supermanthere is no plot except gallo searching and finding his friend in the catacombs why they were searching for the gates of hell only the director knows this should was kept listed film in him and burned it moscow fire entered keep all the homeless for warm extras for night there say nothing more to is about get film that all the other reviewers have written i wish i could forget this brain it hurts my movie
0,i knew this movie wasnt going to be dumbfound but i thought i would give it a chance i am a fan of st luke wilson so i thought it had potential difference unfortunately a lot of the movies dialog was very fake sounding and bum i recall that aquafresh pay some money towards the yield of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout there is a film where the aquafresh house sticks out at you that you cant facilitate but notice it peradventure they should have focused on composition and acting more than how many times can we drop aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed the movie had its moments but im glad i didnt spend to see it in the theater
0,years ago i used to watch bad movies deliberately somehow i missed this one no gesture rings true no facial expression fits the scene or the action ive never heard such inappropriate music for a film at the final scene i was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid one of the worst child actors everonly one name in it i ever heard of wilford brimley he mustve been very hungry to take this partdo not under any circumstances watch this movie youve been warned
1,opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film there isnt a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited
0,having endured this film last night i turned off the dvd player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end throughout the film i felt that i was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie the acting was stiff and taut camera work appalling and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local high school amateur dramatics societythe only saving grace for this movie was that it had amy adams and harriet sansom harris in its credits other than that it was pure dribble
1,allison deans performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film she balances out the melancholy tone of the film with an iridescent energy i would like to see more of her
0,semana santa or angel of death is a very weak movie mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time couldnt she just speak english all the other characters have a forced mexicanenglish accent which is distracting the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden the cinematography looks nice but thats not enough to save this tripe this next part of this review does contain spoilers during the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever avoid
1,this was one of the first color films i have seen at the cinema when was a child it is good to it the girl liz taylor who became a beautiful woman starred together with the and excellent actor mickey rooney the content of the film plot is good for all ages good wills and behavior good ethics of velvets parents particularly mother is something to take into account our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose velvet loves the horses and racing them and mi taylor rooney brought her to an international horse racing competition in england where the end the young won but disqualified because of being female
0,i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the remainder i cannot comment on the taradiddle as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldnt watch it was because of the actors first off for the most part they just looked stiff and im sure their book were in their hands just out of frame but thats a minor release the chief release i have with the actors isnt really their fault its whoever cast this film come on this movie came out in i conceive that casting people in their late twenty dollar bill to play stripling went out of fashion with new moving ridge i cannot watch a movie where one of the low gear lines from a grown military man older than myself is im how can anyone take that seriously dont fall dupe to this movie go out for a manner of walking for bit and youll get far more than this movie could ever give
1,a priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordainedthis movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to god and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures in post war france it is also about the mortal aspect of faith itselfthis may not be the movie of a lifetime but it is a sin to have allowed it to fall in oblivion besides pierre fresnay is sublime
0,had the league been unknowns pitching this script the backers would simply have turned around and said no youre not having the money this is dreadful as a fan of the league of gentlemen this is their poorest outing to date not particularly funny not particularly entertaining there are few laugh out loud moments they do exist but they are few and far between i felt the format was tired and really dragging the film refers to the writers being bored of the characters and it shows as for being a film i felt the xmas special had better production value the fx are generally pretty poor and it is clearly obvious that they didnt film in the original royston vasey they filmed this on the cheap in ireland the musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible also the accents of the characters were largely off from their tv equivalents tubs and edward much underused again just didnt sound like themselves disappointing really because i was hoping for something far more entertaining this really was the leagues equivalent of the s comedies where the cast go to spain
1,the notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today but it is exactly the main characters adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic it is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to stand out to as they refer to their respective spouses not be like themas tony leung said in the film love just happens there doesnt need to be a rational explanation as to how it happens it simply does despite their not wanting to stoop to their respective spouses level it happened fidelity social mores and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition simply being in love is far from enoughi had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities their gross inability to digest the subtleness and the deeper emotions evoked made me realize just how much a film such as this as well as other wong kar weis work is wasted on the local audience
1,darr is a smashing moving picture show shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do about anything to win over his lady which in this font is juhi chawla little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a john major crush on her and is constantly haunt her i have to admit some of the things he did in this moving picture show were pretty creepy crawly like the threatening phone holler neer in my aliveness will i forget the lineage i erotic love you kkkkiranits just too bad that shahrukh and juhi werent exactly together in the film but juhi and sunny do make a fairly full mate in the moving picture show though shahrukhs role was pretty psychotic i still think he did a smashing job of playing it and cant possibly imagine anyone else doing that role no curiosity he get an award for darr in juhi what can i say she looks especially nonplus in this film its not that she doesnt always await nonplus in her other films but darr did give the world a wonderful image of heras for the music it was excellent especially jaadu teri nazar one of my all time favorite songs i also mentation tu mere samne was quite nice alsoa must see for everyone overall darr merit a
0,i didnt like this note sir james augustus murray fomite when it was originally released in the s so i tried watching it again to consider if my aversion for this film was down to my moviegoing savor in the s or was it that grade insignia is simply a unsound picture well the verdict is in and grade insignia is a unsound movienow grade insignia english hawthorn have been innovative comedy in the early s and it english hawthorn appeal to the great unwashed who have gone through basic training or who are note sir james augustus murray fans but its soundless a unsound moviewhy is it unsound mostly because grade insignia is suppose to be a comedy but its just not that risible there are some laughs but they are few and alir between most of the picture is down by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting this lack of comedy is particularly noticeable if youre ill used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman which endeavour for laughs in every part of the moviestripes further tolerate from note sir james augustus murray and harold ramiss lack of playacting power note sir james augustus murray is a great comic but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and harold ramis is playing harold ramis these two are just not good sufficiency as thespian to carry the dramatic arch of the movielastly most of the comedy that there is in grade insignia revolve around note murray selfcentered smartalec manchild character so if you dont find that character risible like i didnt youre not go to find most of what little comedy there is in grade insignia risible eitherstripes is very much a picture of its earned run average it hasnt aged well and is not worth watching if you want to watch an early s buddy comedy i would recommend stimulate crazy like grade insignia the humor in stimulate crazy is not as fastpaced as in contemporary comedies but dissimilar grade insignia it has aged much practiced and as a event is soundless watchable
0,this is absolute drivel designed to shock and titillate the s mindset the acting is completely wooden consisting mainly of adlibbing which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of repetitively the end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldnt care the one exception to this is the lead character joe played by joe dallesandro who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor either stoned or the only one in the piece who can act please dont think i dont get warhol this is plainly and simply a stinker that should never have made it out of a film class
0,the whole movie seemed to suffer from poor editing every scene seemed to take forever to unfold and when they did i felt like i had waited a long time for very little to happen i guess i missed the whole point of the movie either that or there wasnt one
0,while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is brian keiths ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind
1,i enjoyed this movie more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while while i cant quite yet see mark wahlberg as a leader hes gotten good enough to be a credible manager and thats okthe superhero of the movie is the mini cooper its shown to have the speed dexterity and muscle to pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver like charlize therons character
0,speculative movie ever argot trust i languish min of my life watching this crap the only reason i didnt crook it off was i wanted to attend the gangster dude on the cover and he wasnt level in it sing about false publicizing the people that gave this movie a ten are either dumbstupid or cast members or supporter of cast membersi gave it a solid because no one else didi have to publish more and i dont level want to wasting my time utter about this rubbish please dont watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can live where it belongs bed movies i argot level secernate you how bad it in truth is think the speculative movie ever that youve seen then times that be ten and thats this movie it sucked if you just think im being bitter then watch it i dare you this movie should be used to torture warfare criminals or terriosts if they watch this level two times and theyll be spilling the beans and begging for mercy
1,cor blimey this film really information technology surprised me as it is a comedy footstep masterpiece billy zane is stunning live as the central character and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy storm to be natural and easythe soundtrack is really good and the set pieces are a joy to behold i primal recommend that you vitamin a group a watch this film with a bunch of mates a few bottles of your liquor of choice and prepare to be astonished and highly entertainedthis carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan from outer space that it is in the true b lay eyes on information technology movie tradition but extremely what makes it more than that is flair the caliber of the people who took part passing in the film ron pearlman for example i still find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for group a no apparent reason in an almost ballet style all a bit mad and all the better for considerably spotter it
0,this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the castanother problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and first ends up with fairly demeaning work the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these ie they are all firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much dejavu and too few surprises
0,i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people ride and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure im good out of the room before it comes on its so dismay and dingy but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant abide all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with material mystery i think who wants to get it on what happened to fictional persona we get it on nothing about that expire over old age agone i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this
1,i first saw this movie when i was about years old it has been one of my favorites since its so perfect in all its glory complete with awesome soundtrack cheesy dialog and it was both hilarious and terribly sad the first movie i really just had a fit about at the end i wont ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker i just remember feeling so sad for gary what a bunch of cool characters in this movie its genius they are all so great even the nerdy girl gary doesnt likeshe had a nice little body though i cant believe all the girls go for rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck ha ha ha when watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseasesalmost but a love story at heart with real problems dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast i love this movie if you like valley girl another all time classic you will too
0,fact about interior lampoon fail to the movies aka interior lampoons movie madness the movie is poor even by lampoons distinctive monetary standard its not comic no one fail to see a movieso after i finished watching it i began wondering why on earth its called interior lampoon fail to the movies and why it was ever conceived much less actually take in it would be like cry capital of texas powers an american english guy fail to the movies how lame he isnt american english and he doesnt go to movies none of the characters in lampoons socalled isatire are comic and none go see movies which causes a bit of a job i had hop skip it would be something in the vein of mystery science theater but it isntthis was interior lampoons first film after animal house although you couldnt tell it from the quality of film poorly developed rough and amateurish by any standard it induces headaches not a good sign for an infinitesimal movie that look look alike the lengthive notice a pattern really bad movies are typically rename and this trivial disaster capitulation under that category it has two separate titles probably to help stress and promote it to people too dazed to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critic in hmm movie madness ive never heard of this movie before lets rent it and then the actualisation hey wait a infinitesimal this is just interior lampoon fail to the moviesit was postpone by mgmua never to be released into theaters or videodisk it occasionally bolt down up on television a few times per decade which is just about the only place youll manage to find itits split up into three tale a takeoff of selfenlargement tv butter and incorporated ruthlessness and constabulary brutalitycopbuddy films i infer the first segment ace peter riegert animal house as a frustrated guy who divorcement his wife and does some other stuff im not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift until the sex scene popped uppart ii is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter dont ask who adjudicate to become queen of the margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products ouch this contains the only comic blood line in the movie only i can make love with my son if you think that doesnt sound very comic youre right its not and just opine its the highlight of this filmpart threesome is about a cop who give chase down a in series killer christopher lloyd only to lose his nerve and charge the guy it does hold in one comic scene but its extremely overplay only lloyd really demonstrate any humor playing his role juiceless and compassionate yet strangely surreal the percentage where he choking his dupe and the meek cop stands by watching it all blossom out at to the lowest degree evoked a chuckle or twoits a ignominy to watch such a cast of semifamous names repair to low monetary standard the writers of each segment clearly trust that theyre being very wry and clever by burlesque socalled stereotypes the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction favoring the standard t a instead of plot crude humor instead of witty dialogue desperate performance instead of inspired ones its easygoing to see that none of the actors were entranced with the fabric muttering their lines often so embarrassed they can rarely make eye contact with the camerathe movie isnt comic as i said before i laughed once at only one blood line and even then it was a halfhearted one two chuckles a smile and a very weak laugh compared to movie madness a bit of other adequate comedies seem like regular laugh tracksi like interior lampoons vacation series or at to the lowest degree three of four installments and their classic animal house but their holocene slew of directtovideo bombs such as golf game punks with that great comic virtuoso tom arnold provide a good example of why their magazine went out of impress more than a decade ago it gets really old really fastsad to see a unexampled film called gold diggers is being released with their istamp of approval its like condemnatory a film before it even hits theaters perhaps they should embark on not advertising their name all over the placedistributor this movie is bad it gets the interior lampoon stump of approval thatll teach you not to make something so dread next timeforget the death penalty just stick a bunch of malefactor in a way and make them watch this over and over every day for a monthits so bad that i cant even begin to excuse its putrid lousiness i give up
1,i have waited for to comment on this and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret the closing scene between her and joan is simply magical the acting is as good it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you with my words i am looking forward to the remake to see well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy
1,bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent hey hollywood look how good i can act box office disappointments its great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths he wont get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the awarded films of the academy he is at the top of his form in this most recent film its like the return of an old friendcarrey freeman and aniston all do a great job together comfortable in their comedy roles superb comic timing and obviously having fun together but without the hey mom look how funny i am type of comedy a real surprise was steven carrell as carreys nemesis carrell of the daily show fame who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three yearsi can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be upinarms over the treatment of god but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will without married with children t o complain about this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities who know the types men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television selling prayers to god and again about of the country will care and of the media will report itthe bottom line this a purely entertaining film each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do and a feelgood feeling at the movie conclusion a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carrythanks again jim its great to have you back
0,i understood before watching this film that it would be a low budget gore film but even by those low standards this film doesnt cut it the problem isnt so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting writing directing sound music and editing i expected all of that to be bad and it isthe biggest problem with this film is that it didnt even do a good job on the guts and gore most of the action takes place off screen and all we get to see are the after effects which look very fake even by the standards of low budget gore films there really is no excuse for the gore being so poorly done peter jackson made the equally low budget bad taste at about the same time and he somehow was able to make much more convincing guts and gore than was shown in this filma failure on just about every level i cant recommend this film to anybody steer clear of it
0,this is absolute dribble project to shock and titillate the s mindset the acting is completely wooden consisting in the main of adlibbing which consequence in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of repetitively the end answer is of a badly written play being translate by people who have no idea and couldnt care the one exception to this is the lead character joe played by joe dallesandro who spends a lot of the celluloid in a naked stupor either stoned or the only one in the piece who can act please dont think i dont develop warhol this is plainly and plainly a stinkpot that should never have made it out of a celluloid category
1,each of the major studios cranked out jazzy onereelers throughout the thirties and forties with universal taking the lead while most looked as cheap on screen as they were to make warner bros which abruptly stopped making them in often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles mirrors and optical effects thanks to some creative directors like jean negulesco it is fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studiowhat sets jammin the blues apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avantgarde experiment than a hollywood musical filmed in july it transforms an ordinary jam session into a trippy dreamescape from wartime troubles highlighted by the tune of on the sunny side of the street gjon mili and cameraman robert burkes later to work with hitchcock were allowed plenty of artistic freedom perhaps because lester young was not glenn miller and the studio could care less how he and his fellow musicians were presented the optical printer is put to good use with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once norman mclaren really milked this process two decades later in pas de deux while linwood dunns team achieved different effects in citizen kane the strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time in some ways this predated the psychedelic sixties but with a distinctly forties film noir style
1,i need to be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for itor if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the showi enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty snchez offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respectthis is a show that has little taste or class its not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed outnow these guys need to see a psychologist specially the paco character
0,wow this really is stereotypical terrible trash i feel sorry for anyone who may have wasted their money to see thisi am pretty sure i did not laugh once during this serial whole movie i just cannot believe they guess would make non such a terrible moviei will now be more wary when i watch late world health organization night moviesthis is most definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i idaho am not saying it is the worst movie in existence though it could be but i dont think i have seen anything so stupid and unfunny it my life it makes the scary untrusting movie series look intelligent id birth give it a if they would to a greater extent let me
0,has some really good music and performances kid creole and the coconuts james and the blacks dna tuxedo moon the plastics melle mel vincent gallo lydia lunchetc but aside from this isnt much more to it the dialog especially the narrationby saul williams is pretty good but the performances are pretty bland or outright bad no matter how many are thrown in debbie harry and jean micheal basquitthe latter being the leading both still dont have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item it for the a jack kerouac style roving spontaneity but doesnt have the insight to keep it moving along which where the performances come in i its pretty balanced in that regard between great music acting did enjoy it but just expected more though it does a fairy tale ending
0,i recently watched this movie because im a big kinski fan but oh my god dont get me wrong i love this guy but in this movie his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work but fortunately he isnt the only one to blame first of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit thats all all the dialogs and characters are so bad its making you scream but maybe thats the fun of it all if you know the kinskibiography its obvious that kinski didnt care about those movies at all especially all his italowestern roles he just took the money and that was it again this whole movie is totally weird only for hardcorefans of the genre
1,who knew dowdy queen victoria the plump monarch who was a virtual recluse for years after the death of her husband prince albert actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days the young victoria not only chronicles the young queens romance with her husbandtobe but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the thronethe act i isetup draws you in right away following the death of victorias father the duke of kent in less than a year after victorias birth the duchess of kent eventually hooked up with former army officer john conroy who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queentobe conroy insisted that victoria be raised under the atrocious kensington system rules designed to prevent the future queen from having any contact with other children while growing up whats more victoria was forced to sleep in her mothers bedroom everyday until she became queenthe film explains that in parliament passed the regency act which established that victorias mother would become regent and hence guardian in the event that victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor during this time the duchess and conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making conroy her private secretary and treasurer strongwilled victoria would have none of it and refused to go along with conroys and her mothers nefarious plans the duchess disliked king william as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the monarchy the king felt the duchess disrespected his wife as a result the duchess attempted to limit victorias contact with the king in an overthetop scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history the king berated the duchess at his birthday banquet stating that it was his goal to survive until victoria reached her th birthday so that her mother would not become regentking william kept his word and died a short time after victoria became eligible to accede to the throne victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of conroy whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable they were both banished to a secluded apartment in buckingham palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her motherthe young victoria conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding victorias coronation as queen a good part of the film deals with victorias relationship with lord melbourne the whig party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was in the beginning melbourne gains the young queens trust and they become good friends in the early years of her reign she sees melbourne as a progressive but later loses respect for him somewhat as hes revealed to be a typical politician hiding his contempt for the masses whom hes supposed to be championing in reality melbourne was more a father figure to victoria but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert as though they were romantic rivalsthe plot thickens when melbourne is forced out and the queen must commission sir robert peel of the more conservative tory party as the new prime minister the film chronicles the events of the bedchamber crisis in which peel resigned after victoria refused to replace some of her bedchamber ladies with the wives of tory politicians the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady hastings one of the duchesss ladiesinwaiting who was accused of having an affair with john conroy and becoming pregnant by him because of her hatred for conroy victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about hastings alleged pregnancy as it turned out hastings only appeared pregnantwhat she actually had was an abdominal tumor victorias inexperience shows during the bedchamber crisis but the films scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the hastings affairthe rest of the the young victoria deals with of course the romance between the queen and prince albert victoria kept albert waiting as the film makes clear since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new sovereign they spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until albert returned to england and gave victoria support during the trying times of the bedchamber crisisi find a good number of parallels between prince albert and prince philip the current queens husband while philip is mainly danish he went to school in germany and had inlaws who were of german background both albert and philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the court theres a great scene where albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for king george iii even though he had been dead for years alberts struggle was the same for philipas husbands of monarchs they had to find something to do both albert and philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didnt have to live continually in the shadow of their everpopular wivesfortunately theres an excellent scene toward the end of the film where albert infuriates victoria with what she perceives as his interference in her affairs albert doesnt want a second bedchamber crisis so he goes over his wifes head and arranges a compromise involving victorias bedchamber ladies victoria is barely talking to albert when an assassins bullets almost cuts them both down in the film albert is shot in the arm but this never happenedthe performances in the film are uniformly excellent especially the principals emily blunt and rupert friend the young victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography no mention of victorias depression after alberts death but victoria is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson
0,this is a group a simple tale but derived function it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room live for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflectionthe animation is well done but i feel unproblematic like it is too presentational i would have preferred more images from behind more space in the background and maybe then this would real not feel so kitsch to mebut for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps birth a longer film will test if this maker can lack do without the voiceoveri think the voice over is guess too glib
1,the lubitschs touch is more than ever in this film humour at anytime and very subtle the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect a real piece of comedy that isnt getting so old for a xxist century spectator the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage very funny and no problem with lubitsch there is always an happy end a film for men too confident with women dont let your girlfriend watch this movie
1,this movie made me very happy its impossible not to love the smart and sweet orphan girl who changes the heart of a selfish lawyer only interested in pursuing success in her career this is a very optimistic movie and i sincerely believe that we need more films like curly sue it touched my heart
0,not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie but few minutes after it started i wanted to leave the theater for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me then its a waste of time was just nothing there i stayed only because i after some quite beautiful mostly environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design look great while still on posters and screenshots but not when they have to to life they just didnt work mostly because the very same mistake most d companies make technically it is very create really materials in d that would make you feel that the character is alive you need a lot of effort and knowledge hence to create something that really feels like hair skin fabric etc in the movie were made out of cloth and that just didnt work so they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic just didnt have the feel of a material that dolls are made of thats what those characters meant to be i think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters it just had a feeling of a d shootnrun game i dont want go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen dont know about was also a disgrace i am a professional animator and was disappointed at the low level in was boring almost lacked any imagination or mood it was just a little bit above most average d animations i saw and that doesnt add to it any goodand all that the bad design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right that was not the case here actually the story was the worst thing in that movie it was below level it straight it goes and it ends the same there is no twist no surprise no good dialogs even no development weve heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands times and is just one of them and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that the characters dont have time to get the story are just there showing almost immediately and immediately some of them take action without even getting whats going on it just didnt there are also many repetitive action sequences that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a storyacting sound and script oh my gosh what can i tell it was bad story has a bad and except dialogs like no it i will do it but you do we can do it together but there are rules but we have to save him etc etc and so on and itself all the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs there were those non stop ahh and ohhh andehh and oooh and whatchout and run and ohohh that were following almost jump run or fall of the and it even as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsedconclusion bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad characters everything expected no surprises no twist nothing only some good designs are not the time big no

1,gabriella nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it i night it on late saw tv there lauen two hardcore stars in it are montgomery and venus thankfully a hall has just a small part
1,kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance a film mainly through cinematography but also using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets spine from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes of it doesnt that jack nicholson gives the greatest performances ive ever seen a frighteningly authentic portrayal mind gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be nice but its easy to look past those two the rest of the film is plus it features actor with the greatest name of all time scatman crothers
1,i saw the premier of this movie during the phoenix film festival and was very impressed with the skill director jeff hare exhibited in bringing this timely topic to the screen the cast of characters meshed perfectly and allowed us to examine the issue of a senior wishing to die on his own terms in a very warm and humorous way peter falk was brilliant as morris and the supporting group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles the interaction of the family friends and outsiders with morris created a realistic view of how families address the issue of their parents aging and their wishes to die with dignityalthough this movie is ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his family it is truly a movie about all families the jokes the family and morris crack during this romp through the life of a force of nature are fresh and realistic childhood rivalries adult successes and failures and hope for the children are integral to this screenplay while many will question how you can make the topic of suicide humorous i thought the treatment logical and timely if you are not afraid to shed a few tears or laugh at the quips of a family struggling with this issue then you must see this moviethe movie was awarded best picture at the phoenix film festival
1,fear had a black hat is a superbly have film i was laughing almost continuously of start to stuff if you have the means i highly recommend viewing this movie it is by far the funniest movie i crafted from the pleasure to experience grab your finish
1,yes im sentimental schmaltzy but this movie and its theme song remain one of my all time greats robert downey jr does such justice to the role of louis jeffries reincarnated and the storyline although farfetched is romantic makes one believe in happy endings
0,the forgotten aka dont look in the basement is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror moviethe story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited aboutthe patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera tell me you can watch without laughingnow the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesnt really deserve its place on the video nasties listoverall if you arent looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then its worth a watch
0,produced by nott entertainment this movie is nott very good at all i sat through the first of the film before judging the acting is bad the casting is bad and camera work is bad as i hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the it is nott even worth bandwidthup until the time i wrote this review the average vote for this movie was an which prompted me to view it and there an average high of for it voted on by liars and shills movie is nott for everyone or parents if you want to punish kids with this awful film have them sit through this one for halloween
0,not best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i was the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other that is shown might a good movie to watch the s but not for st century
1,as the s drew to a close rumours began to fly in the entertainment industry about the possible return of sean connery to the role he had made famous back in james bondcubby broccoli was asked on location in brazil during the making of moonraker by the bbcs barry norman how he viewed the prospect understandably the producer was reluctant to commit himself to an opinionwhen moonraker opened bond fans were outraged by what they perceived to be a cheapening of the character and the jumping onto the istar wars bandwagon much as live let die had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years earlier many publicly vocalised their hope that connery would return if only to show eon how a real bond movie should lookyears of legal battles followed the original script entitled james bond of the secret service later retitled warhead was written by kevin mcclory len deighton and connery was never filmed and remains one of the great unmade movie blockbustersa new script closer to the thunderball storyline was commissioned it was written by lorenzo semple junior best known as the man who put the camp into batman he had also written the parallax view one of the decades finest conspiracy thrillers feeling the script needed a british touch connery brought in dick clement and ian la frenais writers of hit british sitcoms the likely lads and porridge the witty title was suggested by connerys wife micheline never say never again opened just before christmas to a shower of critical praise normally sensible critics were so ecstatic at connerys return they ignored all other aspects of the film many used it to viciously attack the roger moore series particularly that years octopussy in truth octopussy is superior in every respect never lacks the excitement and spectacle one associates with bond at times it looks like a madefortv movie the story had been done before and better in s thunderball hence never was always going to come off second best it was also hampered by not being part of the official series meaning that monty normans james bond theme and maurice binders gunbarrel logo could not be used as bond connery is magnificent effortlessly stepping back into his most famous role playing bond as an older wiser agent worked barbara carrera landed her best movie role as villainous fatima blush a lady whose love for murder is such she dances after so she thinks killing bond kim basinger smolders as domino as spectre agent maximillian largo klaus maria brandauer gives a chilling performance a major disappointment though is max von sydow as blofeld the posters gave the impression he would be a major character in fact he appears only in a few scenes with a stronger script he could have been one of the alltime great bond villains never promised to be a throwback to the early eon bonds such as from russia with love but did not deliver the gadgets were there but were used almost apologetically bonds rocketfiring motorcycle was a tired gimmick even in the s the film tried to compete with eons bonds in terms of humour bond saving himself by throwing his own urine sample into an assassins face is a farcical a moment as any you will find in moonraker but the nadir comes with the introduction of rowan atkinson as bumbling foreign office official nigel smallfawcett he gives a performance so staggeringly awful you wonder if he thought he was in a footlights revue michel legrands music is horrible the man seems to never to have seen a bond film in his life though the film was a financial success viewed years later it stands as the weakest bond of the s connery himself was disappointed with it and not did act in a movie again for some years was a good year for maniacs in addition to the connery and moore movies george lazenby did a delightful cameo in the madefortv return of the man from uncle the fifteen years later affair
1,i saw a paginate of madness in a silent film feed at wesleyan university and it resort me still after days truly ahead of its time perhaps even still this gem of a film reveals both the frightening and attractive aspects of madness
1,this is so exciting after i saw la roue this afternoon a short lighthearted little movie i consider this one a real treat this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the lanthanum more amazing since it is well nigh an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the s to shame due to its wellbeing innovative use of sound in cinema billet its simply filled with music and an adorable mood thats really upbeat and bottom line it made manlike me happy obviously it wouldnt be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male to a greater extent lead was looking for but the draw pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i didnt even lanthanum think of it twice the comedy is class many times hard hilarious and pine tree state i think it is even information technology superior to manipulation the marx brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the time this is rather perfect
1,this is one of the best comedy ever the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the well just look at the names of the cast and youll understand why it is so great if youre a kevin kline fan does as an fantastic performance and robert jr is perfect if dont laugh seen this movie you dont have any sense of humor

0,i had been waiting eagerly to see this movie but when i finally got the chance i was very disappointed i had to stop halfway or was it quarterway because of the poor script and directing not to mention the poor cast josh hartnett is the only one who can act and hes much more suitable to be the hero of the storywell basically the story is just about a loose girl from the country who cheated on her longtime decent boyfriend only to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat this movie failed to draw my sympathy not even when the writer intended to i wonder where the moral values gothe actors are so stiff that when i resume the movie few weeks after it was interrupted due to its boring nature they still failed to make me pay attention the spoiled couple can only disgust me what a moviei think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and review it together so that they wont make the same mistakes next time round and next time they might consider josh hartnett as the protagonist
0,watching this l thought to myself what a lot of these girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it waste of time watching it faint only it the acting was below and story was unbearable anyone contemplating watching this film please save your money the film has no credit at l am real buff and is worse than attack of the green tomatoesl only hope that this piece of trash didnt cost too much to make money would have been better spent on homeless people the world l only hope there isnt a sequel in pipeline

1,each of the major studios cranked out jazzy onereelers throughout the thirties forties with universal taking the lead while most looked as cheap screen as were make warner bros which abruptly stopped making them in often theirs with offbeat angles mirrors and effects thanks to some creative directors like jean negulesco it is fitting that the best this genre should from this studiowhat sets jammin the blues apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avantgarde experiment than a hollywood musical filmed in july it an ordinary jam session into a trippy dreamescape wartime troubles highlighted by the tune of on the sunny side of the street gjon mili and cameraman robert burkes later to with hitchcock were allowed plenty of artistic freedom perhaps because lester young was not glenn miller and the studio could care less he and his fellow musicians presented optical printer is put to use with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once norman mclaren really milked this process two decades later in pas de deux while linwood dunns team achieved different effects in citizen kane the strong emphasis on silhouettes and cigarette smoke was ahead of its time in some ways this predated the psychedelic sixties but with a distinctly forties noir style
1,a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early s when it first appeared on premium cable stations this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars but the release of the live at budakon album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market which sadly never happened until after the bands demise the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the s but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday dont expect more you wont find it its great fun so enjoy it another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
1,i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy
1,i would reccomend this film to everyone not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue but to all filmbuffs because its sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an outsider is a real joy to watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza who was like freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms because its a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that thanks luciano
0,there are some things i can never understand such as this movie what if i were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing how can anyone even believe that an utterly fake cgi dinocroc that looks completely out of place would influence the events in this movie i know that its bgrade low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through it just doesnt make sense are people really so stupid that they would sit through this apparently so for laughs no this thing isnt even worth laughing at
0,ouch this is one ugly movie not only is it badly acted but it absolutely destroyed the book as well horrible how you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me but they sure did dont even think about even renting this

1,the year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british account on the one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royal thanks to a variety in societal climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the bud love story between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director jeanmarc valle who has only until recently continue in the unbeknownst phantasm of the industriousness here rent victorias story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy its a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet thats partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual faretaking a very direct and focused approach that marrow in on a legal brief quint or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert the thomas young victoria does what so trivial period opus of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figures entire life valle instead opts to show one of the less known intricacies of victorias early years which are easy overlooked in favour of the more publically known accolades the solution is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant see to facts and the like yet never to army of the pure document get in the room of extracting a compelling story writer julian fellowes sticks to his triggerman and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal valle rent this and hunt down wee wee sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in see to both the account require and the viewer watchinga major partly in the joy of watching the thomas young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early s regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieve quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume designs sets pilus fashion lighting and picture taking accentuates the hifalutin background inherent to victorias story without ever overencumbering it so while watching valles interpretation number to life here it is very toilsome not to be go down on in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the optical element and then there the films score also which works hugely to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes script entwine the works of franz schubert and strauss into victoria and alberts story not only works as a point of reference for the part to play with but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that resound composer ilan eshkeris master work just as wellyet for all the poignant compositions alcoholic backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every picture the single most important factor hereand so to most period dramasare the performances of the drop and how they assistance bring the world they live in to life gratefully the thomas young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both thomas young and old that do a grotesque job of doing just that between the sweet bud love story of victoria emily point blank and albert rupert friend and the jolly antagonistic struggles of her adviser and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark inviolable and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowes screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all require which aid keep the movie from being a pliant nice to look at but blur underneath amour so common with these outingsin the end its toilsome to fault a work such as the thomas young victoria its obtain a perfectly partake and human sense of affection within its perfectly pace love story plus some historical significance that toy as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience groovy on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by surprise and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a touchingly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it pleasurable valle never seem to be striving for splendor nor does he seem content at wee wee a runofthemill escapist bit for aficionados somewhere within this grayish middleground lies the thomas young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a trivial more disenchant by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human a review by jamie robert guard
0,semana santa or angel of death is a very weak movie mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people mira has an italian accent which from time to time she just speak english all the other characters have a forced mexicanenglish which is distracting the dialogue is very and the delivery of it is wooden the cinematography looks nice but thats not enough to save this this next part of this review does contain spoilers during the climax it looks like the is going to but then he comes back down stairs to shot and do a cool stunt down the railing that just shows this script has no originality avoid
0,if you thought rosemarys baby was bad this one much better easily one of the worst movies made like its lame predecessor it goes nowhere fast rating out
0,its hard to criticize this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry
1,the vampire craze has my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization there were many subgenre films last year from a of countries ive reviewed many and have a few more to discuss forgive my indulgence but since ive recognized the trend a phenomenon which it is and coincidentally features my favorite horror im going to now move outside of north america for a bit and introduce you to meaning films that you didnt see as of nowof the of twilight is the creation of guy girl vampire movies i hate this sexist categorization which has the effect of polarizing an generation of fans into i think men are prone to hate stephenie meyers and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense betrayal that an archetype which was theirs is now liberated women may be to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that enforced four we more directors to vampire films either gender is capable of enjoying if vampires going to survive the craze and remain relevant cue thirst this korean film was directed park chanwook of oldboy fame there are two ways to dissect it either it straddles between gender and is marginally or it is a floundering mess that doesnt decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one dont let me convince that the film has no inclinations its director is a man whose fame is storydriven action films its protagonist is male and has a passiveaggressive interest in his lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal is not contrived and his is returned is a male slant to this picture yet it not onesided that could not enjoy it the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moonthe follows an emile zola novel called raquin which i have not read to wikipedia the novel is about an affair develops between a married woman and single man kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture dead mans body between them they are thus driven to insanity but care for the womans ailing at the novels conclusion they try to kill each other each others plans and commit suicidenow transcribe this nearly year old french novel into modern south korea and youve got thirst chanwook doesnt the story enough to elevate this to he often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration i think the memorable parts when his scruples are unhinged by narrative his use of the as the foil for bad romance is just perfect itthe protagonist is originally a devout christian who becomes a vampire a faulty blood transfusion following volunteering for a new medicine he thus becomes the god once was people flock to him and view him as a grand healer ok thats really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it instead confronting the delusional he sips blood out of comatose hospital patientslets continue with the christian allusion the woman the vampire man into killing her husband her overprotective suffers a stroke and warns of the of her daughterinlaws treachery finger waggles the man kills her but resurrects the two of them invite the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans the man says enough and to drive a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him they both die but atones for her crimes and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominentlythe woman character is a caricature and her an explanation for her behavior she is housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive vampirism magnifies their characteristics she becomes a monster like one would expect of someone knowledge he becomes demigod with a spirit his life is how atheists view themselves and life is how religious people view those without divine intervention
1,cor blimey this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece billy zane is stunning as the central character and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easythe soundtrack is really good and the set pieces are a joy to behold i recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates a few bottles of your liquor of choice and prepare to be astonished and highly entertainedthis carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan from outer space that it is in the true b movie tradition but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film ron pearlman for example i still find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style all a bit mad and all the better for it
1,a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the s hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian
1,this is a transfix fib that borrows elements from the john fitzgerald kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an first class western talethe movie has a right medicine musical score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too lots giuliano gemma and the rest of the mould are superb this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on fib than action and it succeeds because the fib is first class this is not to say that there is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right outside and keeps you wrapped til the end youll always be wondering whats in those documents everyones after it also has some pungent comment on american politicsthis movie shows why valerii in my impression is in a three way crosstie with sollima and corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors

0,ugh what can i say other than ugh rented this film because it was as a sequel to the original vampires this movie could not have been any lamer lacking not only in plot but the acting is atrocious combined with some obvious plot holes makes movie a very hard to many times i my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had the shark heres a sampling of the lamer aspectsspoilersprofessional slayer on sleeping outdoors himself at night he wakes up to a woman crying more than feet from him in the middle of nowhere immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance she goes from crying seducing him and he lets it happen with obvious resultsone of the main characters is zoe was bitten a vampire but as long as she takes these experimental pills she got in mexico city shes fine although her body temperature is below room temperatureguard outside of monastery where hero is staying the is vampires hero leaves the next day he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he leftavoid this movie

0,the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture the land of plenty seals the coffin im afraid by being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental and clichd film the characters are entirely flat and stereotyped the writing plot and direction are amateurish at best for the first time in quite a while i was impatient for the film to end so i could get on with my life the wartorn delirium of the uncle the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusionit all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen what happened the days of experimentation perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him im afraid lets hope he finds his inspiration again at the toronto film festival which is where i saw the film wenders was there to introduce it completely lacking in humility he offered us the following i hopeno waiti know youre going to enjoy the next two hours im afraid he couldnt be more wrong

1,has there ever been a moving picture show more captivate than this one of the understanding everything make for so well is that the grouping of actors in truth seem to interact and have an effect on each others lives the center of it is the romance of mob stewart and margaret sullavan who mould together and cant get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also endure characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including youve fuck off ring armor the recent update of shop theyre not just whipped up to support the ii leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in moving picture show history takes place when the neartragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for soul to have christmas dinner party with a must see out of
0,while being a great james arness western this film has gone down downright the worst alamo or brian it the story were made inaccuracy all through terrible and just as untruths to enough continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the that was dumb boot to fire cannons mexicans obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is ever keiths ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something film just out of their mind
1,i think this is one of the best movies of all time i just think it shows realistically what romance and especially black romance is all about would love to know what others think as well the acting was just out done where is tate anyway it has been awhile since i have seen him in anything however i think he has out did his acting performance in this movie
0,spoilers within what a dull predictable nonscary snorefest the movie had no character development i felt no empathy towards any of the characters except may be the small boy and did not care what happened to any of them the movie had so many clichd bits or elements stolen from other horror moviesthe movie was so predictable many times i would be saying to myself let me guess fill in guess happens next yup i was right even in the opening scene i predicted that the attack on the family was by some man probably the father because only the wife and children were attacked sure enough that is what happened of course you have to wait minutes to find out for sure and of course another evil man scenario why was he evil and killing his family because hes a man duhas someone else stated this movie may be scary for someone under years of age or for a movie from the s but it is far from being a iscary movie by todays standards and like so many other crap horror movies a lot of the scares were fakes scary music scary music scary music anda crow suddenly flies at the window wow scaryhow did the old bank guy manage a few times to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him i thought for sure that the old man was a ghost nope just a crappy moviei rated this movie a out of because it did keep my attention enough to sit through the whole thing
0,i think i can really say without safely giving it of that this movie had no away in it the of in robot would didnt or act speak as such and the evil entity behind the whole robots isnt a robot eitherthe whole thing looks like anything was shot a in city park somewhere with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set i cant even the words to describe the actingthis couldnt even offer the hilarious all of star crystal in short it is clearly one guys the worst scifi movies plot use s and i costumes be so bold as to say of ending time
0,its a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this its just a big shame and its also big shame if people like hp lovecraft get abused by the likes of this i rented this movie cuz of the drop hp lovecraft on it and im a big fan of many of his adaptions mainly those done by brian yuzna stuart gordon this movie has nothing to deliver a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old winecellar digicam effect red light over the whole movie no actors just some stupid lowgrade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing stiff as wood and so must be the director its obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesnt work and no goreeffects just some blood in a river you drink you become demon and dropping here and there oh yeah the story thousands of years ago some big old colonised the world and took humans as slaves then mankind got independent so the old ones tried to destroy them and now there are some survivors in a postapocalyptic world the only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon thats where it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their winecellar unbelievable the whole thing but as it is dubbed german title armee des jenseits and you can find it in most commercial videostores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this fact impressive
1,a funny comedy from beginning to end there are several hilarious scenes but its also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it
1,although it strays away from the book a little you cant help but love the atmospheric music and settingsthe scenes in bath are just how they should be although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside i like the scene where they are in the hot baths but did the men and women really bathe together like that you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the ballroom scenes were very nice the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful i especially liked catherines dress in the first ballroom scenenorthanger abbey looked suitably imposing but i enjoyed the bath scenes betterschlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feelugh peter firth as mr tilney he just talks a load of rubbish and is not a clergyman as he should be its hard to think of him being in love with catherine but then the book never really gave that impression eithergeneral tilney is played reasonably well by hardy and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney as for john thorpe well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but i quite like iti can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me the marchioness i hate her she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boysome of the script is peculiar when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks i suppose you saw the body how did it appear what a silly thing to say elinors calm response is stupid tooanyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me

0,i had been waiting thirstily to see this movie but when i finally got the chance i was very disappointed i had to stop halfway or was it quarterway because of the poor book and directing not to cite the poor cast josh hartnett is the only ace who can act and hes much more suitable to be the hero of the storywell basically the history is just about a informal girl from the country who cheated on her longtime in good order boyfriend only to have meaningless arouse with a spoiled rich brat this movie failed to draw my sympathy not even when the writer intended to i admiration where the lesson values gothe actor are so corpse that when i resume the movie few week after it was fitful due to its boring nature they still failed to make me pay attending the spoiled duad can only disgust me what a moviei think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and review it in concert so that they wont make the same misunderstanding next time round and next time they might deliberate josh hartnett as the protagonist

0,maybe our standards for vientam movies mayhap have increased since born on the fourth plot of land of july full metal jacket and platoon this movie has a predictable plot bad writing incredible bad acting bad directing bad special group a effects etc compared with other vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable
0,im only going to write more because its required however the summary i put at the top is way too wordy for what this film was you pretty much know whos in on it from the beginning in spite of its attempts at plot twists and turns acting talent trying hard to have looks of shock and dismay when a twist happens you never really need to wonder whodunit in this mysterythe more i write the more i feel bad that i have to write so much in order to have a comment but rules are rules i really feel bad about saying this but this is the lowest ive ever rated a movie i think it makes me wonder what im saving votes of and for however i thought this film deserved a since i believe there was some talent in the film johanna watts or is it watson did a pretty good job she was crying and distraught in one part and i thought she conveyed that emotion well the man who played the character that was the drummer did well too for his short partmany of the actors did an ok job but the lead actor david forget his last name terrible with names was pretty bad i think he must have thought he was doing dramatic displays for the young and the restless or days of our lives if you try you can just picture him in a white lab coat playing a doctor with multiple personalities on general hospital it doesnt help that the movie is even shot like a daytime soap although im pretty sure i could shoot this same movie with a camcorder though without the obvious and soapish sound editingfirst time i ever thought the money to rent this movie was wasted though i wouldnt watch it again unless i was paid a large sum of money
0,you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates aka reads the script plot synopsis over his characters funeral procession a mere minutes into the movie the narration is his characters last will testament it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his children and servants the children shall split million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants to be eligible they must live in the family estate for a week it sounds like the typical plot of a reality showthere is little subtext as to the nature of the deans they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog from the opening voiceover by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending that journey is painfully slow and pointless we trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through the fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men constant bickering misplaced circus music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of fauxgerman expressionism the horror aesthetic of the th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting this all inevitably leads to the expected ungratifying ending you will be happy to still be alive but the pain might be too great to bear alone share children sharecelluloid rehab
1,when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of its century of the cinema series he grabbed the opportunity with both hands a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating and as the title says a highly personal look at hollywood cinemascorceses is primarily about hollywoods directors producers and other collaborators barely get mention he states right from the that for him the primary conflict within film industry is between directors vision and the distributors profit motive between and commercial viability he even opens with a clip from vincente minnellis the and the beautiful of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction this dictates the structure for the documentary scorcese looks how genres have darkened and clichs have become challenged how mavericks have challenged the production code and how certain filmmakers fell grace when they dared different however scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio he lavishes cecil b de mille or those had less of a recognisable style but master craftsmen of the cinema nonethelessscorcese doesnt necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either orson alfred hitchcock two of biggest influences are in passing instead he looks at the individuals and films that serve his story for example he shows us a of john ford films to how the western evolved he looks at the work of vincente minnelli probably the most often referenced director of documentary show how a supposedly wholesome the could also have darker undercurrents i can imagine that had this assignment not been limited to america scorcese would have also loved to talk about for example his italian or his british powell as it is he stretches the of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw billy and douglas as well as the of usborn filmmakers that was produced elsewhere such as that of stanley kubrickrather than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically scorcese compares films from various eras in order to tackle various subjects in his section on the language tools of cinema he begins with dw griffith looks at the coming of sound colour and widescreen and inevitably ends going over computer generated effects which scorcese is keen on them is evenhanded enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them however he doesnt simply finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it instead he then back the s to show how a lowbudget horror like cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest of elementsa personal journey through american movies has to be one of the film documentaries made there were a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have discovered without and even the most seasoned film buffs would likely to find something new broad scorcese has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures i pleased see that when he talks about kubrick in his iconoclasts chapter looks at lolita and lindon for me his two most underrated films scorceses respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play fully rather than just giving tiny bits and he interrupts them with talking heads a combination of archive and new interviews only necessary there is a bit of bias towards the s and s that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and cinema and after all i dont think this documentary have been had it been a journeyone word of warning though in its in depth look at certain pictures this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers
0,the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee matlins character was throughout the story deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way matlin did all in all the movie itself is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that id like to believe that it is an insomniacured movie if i have a problem sleeping i can simply pop in children of a lesser god and watch it will put me to sleepkeep in mind this is a deaf guy talking
1,you want a movie thatll take you places well this is a good pick if you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this filmthe hayday of motownor if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about i suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch at the risk of sounding cliche youll laugh youll cry youll reminisce and remember youll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight youll recall with fondness your best friends from school its a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realismmisconceptions losing friends deciding what to do with your life i think everyone regardless of race age socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it so take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film there are much worse ways you could spend your time
0,oh son this movie is so mediocre i dont really know what on the dot to save about it i think its easier to save what its not its not very entertaining its not original and there not one character in the whole movie i cared aboutkind of reminds me of a sure reality tv show on mtv but without any interesting people it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end the only thing that continue me from switching it off was jennifer lyons ci view a long prison term about this movie to discovery one effective thing to read about it what i liked was the monitor not to judge a person by the first notion you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a musical score of out of instead of a
0,this was on tv last night i painfully forced my way through it and barely made it through first of all except for leroy hilary and possibly coco none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent its like hspa had no standards just sign on the dotted line and youre in the story lines were grating and obvious doris was just impossibly awful the gay guy was such a thrown away clich funny how that school had only one gay guy right i liked the leroy character but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy packing lisa looks like shed rather be anywhere else and since she wasnt any talent i wonder why they kept her i would have rated this one star awful but the music wasnt that bad and i did like the premise it just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent
1,first watched this years ago with my daughter who is now and fell in love with the we both thought it was a top film then watched sub then sub now find there is sub v which cannot wait to fangs also there is fifth in the pipe line if no one seen the movies these the best of the best think it deservers a thousands oscars i could watch these from morning to nighti would love to a set nails like he out i love it as all the story lines continues from film to film these ant typical vampire movies they better i would love to live in the life that is protruded in the films it would make all my dreams true
0,the threesome of handbill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason playing period coney island carnys contend for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal who sells salt water taffy with the irruption of world war i the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar the first half of this rko pathe production is gruelling going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcook oneliners and isnappy dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half reduce on action sequences as the us us navy pursues both a german merchant squad car and a uboat these sequences are full of life and wellfilmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat closing for fans of the stars only
1,kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film mainly through cinematography but also using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes of course it doesnt hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances ive ever seen a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be nice but its easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time scatman crothers
0,had league been unknowns pitching this script the backers would simply have turned around and said youre having the money this is dreadful a fan of the gentlemen this is their poorest outing to date not particularly funny not particularly entertaining there are few laugh out loud moments they do exist but they are few far between the format was tired and really dragging the film the writers being bored of the characters and it shows as for a film i felt xmas special had better production value fx are generally pretty poor it is clearly obvious that they didnt in the royston vasey they filmed this on the cheap in musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible also the accents of the characters were largely off their tv equivalents tubs and edward much underused again didnt sound themselves disappointing really because i was hoping for something far more entertaining this really was the equivalent the s comedies where the cast go to spain
0,many people thought that this is a good movie but i dont agree with them the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything the screen can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the came to earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed for no reason he not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration the movie is only minutes long the is too short and it cant tell the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i think this is a good movie
0,i saw the mst k version of this film and it is a bad movie but its not nearly as bad as its low imdb rating currently out of at least the movie has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the primary problem with this movie is that it had no appealing characters whatsoever the main character marv is so pathetically morose that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him and he isnt very smart either or he would have figured out to stay away from the conniving girl betty and even more pathetic than marv is his father who is nothing but a drunken loser the highlight of the film is the heist sequence at the end but even that is so weakly executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at least this movie made for a very funny mst k episode as mike and the bots do a great job making fun of it
0,upwards this film is not devoid of charm overburden and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed terminate on the leads bite there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but core clock time she takes too focused much of the limelight away from the rest of the castanother problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding out it difficult to get a good job whatsoever and first ends up with fairly demeaning work the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who job goes for glitz over substance the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs overburden non etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these ie they are all firmly rooted in reality but overburden in combination they are just too much and leave non us with too much realism dejavu and too few surprises

0,facts about national lampoon goes to the movies aka national lampoons movie madness the movie is poor even by lampoons typical standards its not funny no one goes to see a movieso after i finished watching it i began wondering why on earth its called national lampoon goes to the movies and why it was ever conceived much less actually made it would be like calling austin powers an american guy goes to the movies how lame he isnt american and he doesnt go to movies none of the characters in lampoons socalled isatire are funny and none go see movies which causes a bit of a problem i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science theater but it isntthis was national lampoons first film after animal house although you couldnt tell it from the quality of film poorly developed rough and amateurish by any standard it induces headaches not a good sign for an minute movie that seems double the lengthive noticed a pattern really bad movies are typically renamed and this little disaster falls under that category it has two separate titles probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in hmm movie madness ive never heard of this movie before lets rent it and then the realization hey wait a minute this is just national lampoon goes to the moviesit was shelved by mgmua never to be released into theaters or dvd it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade which is just about the only place youll manage to find itits split up into three stories a parody of selfenlargement videos butter and corporate ruthlessness and police brutalitycopbuddy films i guess the first segment stars peter riegert animal house as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff im not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift until the sex scene popped uppart ii is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter dont ask who decides to become queen of the margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products ouch this contains the only funny line in the movie only i can make love with my son if you think that doesnt sound very funny youre right its not and just imagine its the highlight of this filmpart iii is about a cop who chases down a serial killer christopher lloyd only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy it does contain one funny scene but its extremely overacted only lloyd really exhibits any humor playing his character dry and compassionate yet strangely surreal the part where hes choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold at least evoked a chuckle or twoits a shame to watch such a cast of semifamous names resort to low standards the writers of each segment clearly believe that theyre being very ironic and clever by spoofing socalled stereotypes the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction favoring the standard t a instead of plot crude humor instead of witty dialogue desperate performances instead of inspired ones its easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material muttering their lines often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camerathe movie isnt funny as i said before i laughed once at only one line and even then it was a halfhearted one two chuckles a smile and a very weak laugh compared to movie madness a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracksi like national lampoons vacation series or at least three of four installments and their classic animal house but their recent slew of directtovideo bombs such as golf punks with that great comic genius tom arnold provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago it gets really old really fastsad to see a new film called gold diggers is being released with their istamp of approval its like condemning a film before it even hits theaters maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the placedistributor this movie is bad it gets the national lampoon stamp of approval thatll teach you not to make something so awful next timeforget the death penalty just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a monthits so bad that i cant even begin to explain its putrid vileness i give up
1,set in hong kong in turbulent times as we are informed this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors evocative yet restrained sensuality as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication its not hard to see the influence of marguerite duras here since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and nonverbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of reenacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters lives from hiroshima mon amour to moderato cantabile her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of mr chow tony leung and mrs su lizhen maggie cheung to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationshipthe plot even resembles something that duras could have written mr chow and mrs su lizhen neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them and they discover quite naturally its with each other the question is should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other and at one point it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of cheungs dresses we never see it and just as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen some catalyst and the only one which comes is when leung reveals to her that he loves her followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband which implies that neither will he it also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do from a western point of view a consummation of their romance into a more solid lasting affair would have been possible especially in the s but as its hong kong cultural values are markedly differentperformances here are of the high order its very easy to play a torrid love affair but to continually play a repressed platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual cheung and leung smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled
0,this motion picture show was by far the worst motion picture show ive ever had to endure i couldnt believe that they tried to pass it off as a sober motion picture show it was so bad i couldnt eve laugh at its pathetic attempt to entertain me if you neediness chintzy horror that you can laugh at rent dr giggles instead
0,first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i am close to joining the hate club this movie makes absolutely no sense at all the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture pornexploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions cops bust seed in his house act stupid and get slashed in the dark this sequence reminds me of a video game you barely see anything except flashlights seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed except for one who busts him seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this movie he wont die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives electric jolts guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problem seed comes out of his grave kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it seed captures the cops family lures him to his house threatens to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats seed wants its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word the movie has barely any dialog anyway so dont mind boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence this is it no message no plot no reason no face behind the mask no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a childthis movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its like watching august underground thats fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camerawork effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid so how does boll get money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living proof that the free market is flawed lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments
0,the storyline was okay neer akshay kumar was good as just about always and lone that was the only good only thing about the highschool movie lean kareena kapoor looked bad sol there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good wherefore leaner i dont know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film red indian does not means that arse around an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do matter they think they aught will show men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is guess the indian thoroughly police so stupid that they thoroughly are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of policemen and no one was non there to surround the palace the action was crap round and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between meet a circle of policemen in that location all only shooting at him and he shooting back at them none live of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crapi consider think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirementi strongly information technology recommend not to see this movie
0,i agree with one commentator who says that its really impossible inventive to review glen or glenda objectively if one does eve so the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given criterion the hilarious convoluted dialog the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values yet eve such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds it isnt the fact that betray cross dresser the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the s its not even the plea for tolerance of people oecumenical who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an cross dresser historic relicno what distillery makes glen or glenda still a fascinating film after years is that sir alfred hitchcock ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that socalled fair auteur directors like hitchcock or godard despite their vastly take out superior talents never did in glen or glenda wood isnt afraid to pic reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film indeed the conclusion of the film suggest that ed woods glen helium character will be able to scorn kill his sure enough glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection kickoff glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife barbara the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference witness glenda will female person disappear so while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general he wasnt so sure betray of desiring it surrogate for himselfmoreover wood wasnt afraid of squeeze throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen he did natalie wood it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on if womanly it didnt cohere so what live collapse what the viewer saw hour angle in glen or glenda especially was ed woods imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangenessthe only comment i considerably wish pic to add to my comment above is that my twostar rating utterly is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in time in the first paragraph the oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities insufferable i dont think can pic be later rated
1,simply put this is the best movie to come out of michigan since well ever evil dead eat your heart out hatred of a minute was some of the oddest and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip or a good case of the willies
1,i saw this film at the galway film fleadh the year it won best short film i have to say that i thought the direction was fantastic and the performances from the key cast members were very memorable both of the main cast are definitely names to watch out forthe final shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and i for one would like to find myself there if i was waiting for the end of the world to happen the kiss was definitely a great payoff done with great enthusiasms i can only assume that the film was shot on film and i have heard that the dop won an award at the tribeca film festival for his work on this film and i must say well deservedi would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the s it brought back some great memories and some scary ones
0,overall call this a disappointing performance it attempts the old horror anthology approach but fails miserably the acting was bad and so were the stories any skin shown the movie was obviously random just to attract the for i guess but bad nonetheless take your and a real movie instead
0,or watched the least recently and communism poorly resembles the book is based on i blame this on poor screenplay and direction some too were forcibly introduced the should rape scene for film apparent tries i actually read the it after watching the movie and some years or so after reading it for the first time i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy as many disparate ideas introduced for no time at all other than sensational parts for the benefit anymore it covers stuff a was deemed isensitive to say the film during it i can see the fascination book produced at the scenes that isnt the case too though or maybe i see being differently now i a bit of both the no reason parts much to the many aspects from the book the result things that concoction of time that may make some sense to someone who read cover book even watch this is a film that is difficult to so and maybe gay have never been made
0,my yearold daughter alexandra writesi thought it was very boring and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at the beginning they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
0,a smile like yours is a piteous comedy that really earn no sense i dont mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot is based on one thing a couples desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children hoi polloi who tried that laborious mustve forget of the option of the acceptation to which this pic is not kind tolauren buddy holly spiel jennifer robertson a nail contradiction in terms to anything offered by the womens liberation movement exhibiting almost no sense of independence she is quite an a tiresome character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her mind but to have kids like a obtuse s romance comedy greg kinnear is her submitting economize who likewise video display no personality no independence and from us no interestthey are the deuce most tiresome and often annoying eccentric and they hardly make for topic of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps which should arise from a mates doing all they can to mystify pregnant except they really dont do anything except croak to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own except for that in vitro fertilization number the plot hardly allows for any mishaps because well the mates dont do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation they just croak to this clinic so whatthe subplots are have in mind to exam the faithfulness of the mates a requisite moral ingredient of the story since the mates does be after on believe children together jennifer wreak at a unexampled age shop with her friend played by joan cusak and they are in the business concern of developing aphrodesiacs st christopher macdonald spiel the intrested buyer and jennifer is the prognosticate negotiator of a reasonably price for her and her friends ware the subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested although joan cusak is reasonably funny in the restaraunt scenedanny kinear is an designer who finds an chance to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills by learn on a job in seattle where his emboss is the crass seductress besides another hopeless lost female character who tries to influence danny as obtuse as he is to have an liaison with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons i dont care to founder by jill hennesy is good in the function but her character is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed ingredient to create conflict for danny it is stupid and once again hardly interesting the boilersuit pic itself is utterly tiresome and hardly funny at all save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight the plot offers nothing that is really attentiongrabbing still if the story was entirely about deuce hoi polloi trying to conceive the writers couldve figured out respective hilarious mishaps to modernize out of that second the chief eccentric are completely tiresome they are nail silouhettes of obtuse s comedies with happy wife and clueless economize so still without mishaps present in the plot the eccentric themselves offer nothing interesting let unique funnyjoan cusak shouldve been in the trail and someone else shouldve taken kinnears part cusak wouldve made still a lousy story outrageously funny as she sometimes does in her costarring function here this is in spades one to passing play up
1,i have seen a lot of ppvs in the past but this is the most entertaining intense ppv and the most complete dvd i have ever seen the dvd extras are worth it because they it gives a different view of how the wrestlers act after the show such as the chris benoit interviewedge interview some glimpse into the monday night wars erathe first match of hogan winning tag title gold and some promotional talk additionally there is a good music video tag team table match bubby ray and spike dudley vs eddie guerro and chris benoit this was a pretty good intense match to start off the show not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity spike can hold his own in tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat wwe crusierweight championship jamie noble w nidia v billy kidman the crowd really didnt care about either wrestler and didnt get interested until kidman did a shooting star press usually people expect a lot of high flying in a cruiser weight championship but this had very little in fact it was so bad that when noble hit his finisher no one even cared or knew you can tell by the lack of cameras flashing the ending was quick though wwe european championship jeff hardy v william regal ive never really liked regal as a wrestler he lacks intensity and style hardy was impressive but really didnt get a chance to show off his high flying act although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match john cena v chris jericho its funny looking back at cenas very first ppv how he used to act how he used to dress and how he used to look watch his interview its pretty funny this was a good intense match with cena showing a nice variety of holds suplexes counters and some aerial jericho was subpar but definitely helped cena launch his career cena wins wwe intercontenital championship rvd v brock lesnar this was a very intense and good match both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen with brocks pure power and raw energy vs rvds skill full moves and quickness rvd looked great in this match better than his later matches with edge and cenaand the entire match was fast pace the ending worked perfectly because it still preserved brocks undefeated streak while giving rvd his just desserts in his home state no disqualification match booker t v big show another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the rvd match but still a good follow up although it started off kinda slow which it always is with big show booker t was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table the finisher was awesome the ending was a great upset and big move up for booker t wwe tag team championship hogan and edge v christian and lance storm this was a mediocre match hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy then again christian doesnt exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself this ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still ok for ppv triple threat match for the undisputed championship rock v undertaker v kurt angleeasily the match of the year this is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen it had close falls plenty of finishers stolen finishers raw energy intensity and fast pace no one could predict who would come out of this one if your going to buy this dvd i would buy it strictly for this match ending watch for yourselfoverall this was a solid ppv with plenty of extra goodies to keep you watching again and again although this is hard to find i had to pay a little more than usual for this dvd it is definitely worth your money
1,this movie is a great mocumentary it follows the rap group nwh made up of ice cold tasty taste and tone def through their unique path to gangster rap highs lows and back to highs through trouble with women egos cops and whitey this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world as this movie goes to the top of mocumentaries i know everybodies favorite mocumentary is this is spinal tap for very good reason however i think that if in the right mood this movie is simply better the laughs never end even for someone not into the rap cultureim a white guy that has no interest in rap music culture or anything else associated with it however i love this movie rusty cundeif who wrote the screenplay songs and starred in it showed great potential and it is a shame that i havent seen him since fear of a black hat however i have seen him one more time than you have and is that that i recommend fear of a black hat to you for quick laughsremember dont shoot to you see the whitesof their eyes no dont shoot to you see the whitesfym and enjoy the movie
1,unlike the many who have posted here im not movie literate i stumbled across this movie by accident channel surfing and couldnt surf away this is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it the actors are terrific tatiana is beautiful and innocent her fianc boris is sweet and patriotic you couldnt help but feel boris fathers exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great warothers have summarized the movie so well so ill just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most when boris brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and has to marry tatiana tatianas twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape you fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on tatiana and the brother or worse show tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence since this isnt french existential cinema the latter doesnt happen thankfully another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by boris returns to tell boris father of the death of his son he unwittingly breaks the news to tatiana i cant describe the sorrow of this scene stilltatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that boris will yet come home the musician actually never saw boris buried after alli wont mention more scenes but do want to observe that the touches of soviet political correctness didnt detract at all from the film boris brother is revealed as the piano playing antisoviet slacker that someone who steals his brothers wifetobe would have to be no doubt he gets at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film the ending when tatiana finally learns for certain that boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future you dont even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war with their own losses in mind first saw this movieincredible go see it
0,i simply cannot understand how any who fan or just plain anyone could bump this direful lazy ailing written abomination even remotely funny it is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy the potential for this was huge it could have been enceinte what a shame that all that acting talent the jell the props the goodwill of everyone demand was so pathetically wasted by a playscript that should have been burnedthere is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and prize control here like those hammy hollywood flick mad mad mad world casino royale where the stars are just mug for each other and having a enceinte time which basically substance picking up a cheque for doing nothingi could have written a better who sendup in my sleep in fact i have while awake though i did it in year in high school and do it with a bunch of class fellow it was better i look at it now and the gags are suspicious steven moffat you are a no talent cheesy what a godforsaken what a wasted chance makes me want to vociferation
1,the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has its a genial summer camp movie so the jokes arent mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule pranks do take place but you get the feeling that the respective fallguys would be able to look back and laugh having been dopey enough to fall for them and without being too cheesy its actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the endits an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray for me hes still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose no ones better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day everythings silly yes but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of goodnatured fun meatballs promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch
0,this was on tv last night i painfully forced my manner through it and barely made it through first of all except for leroy hilary and mayhap cocos nucifera none of the other students we are supposed to wish about have any discernible talent its wish hspa had no standards just sign on the stud line and youre in the story lines were grating and obvious doris was just impossibly amazing the gay guy was such a bewilder off clich funny how that school had only one gay guy right i liked the leroy character reference but forebode your teacher an obscenity and then vandalise the school should have commit leroy packing lisa looks wish shed instead be anywhere else and since she wasnt any talent i enquire why they kept her i would have rated this one star amazing but the music wasnt that bad and i did wish the premise it just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and in reality had some talent
0,actually i feel like having my survey be that nonpareil word my protagonist whose opinions i almost always bank about pic specially horror pic warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or world weary or desperate to see a new horror movie i was because it was a stark waste of time unfortunately i havent talked to him in a while and i was in a hurry to blame a movie and mentation what the heck how bad could it be why dont i study what was i thinking did i think it would as if by magic turn into a better movie while seat there on the ledge for years waiting to be rentedthe game touch a guy who edits celluloid for some company his boss is a jerk the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the precredits chronological succession so for some intellect the boss picks nerdy ed for the special project of editing loose limbs splatter pic he neer says what ed is supposed to redact but i approximate that doesnt matter ed is upset by some of the clip do work on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to relocate him to for no ostensible intellect he asks his boss if he can stop or do some other project but his boss doesnt care he start out to slow spell insane purportedly from ascertain the clip and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life or has he been this direction all along please note that i am making this game levelheaded much more cryptical concern and coherent than it actually iswe dont care about the characters at all or have any sympathy for them or tied detest the bad guys the game is really really boring and predictable the splatter isnt tied that gruesome or creativethis is not deserving renting just to see the bloodshed because what there is isnt concern or originalall the tributes to sam raimi just get along off like really bad ripoffs and noone in the movie is anyplace near beneficial looking enough as robert i campbell so you cant trouble yourself with that i think an evil absolutely iidead by aurora poster is only conspicuously displayed in nonpareil scene in the promise that sam raimi will be flatter and not consider any class of legal action a trained chimp could have written a better screenplay every time i hear lines like are we having funyet which tied bridget of reanimator couldnt tear off without making me wince i start feeling like picking up some class of madly weapon system myself characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation wandering in only to get killed this might be okeh if the movie was tied remotely amusing or entertaining but it was all i could do to keep from fastforwarding through most of it as luck would have it i chose to pay some government note and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was play bank me it did not involve my full attentioni still felt like minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the backgrounddont watch it no matter how tempted you areyoull detest yourself for wasting your money horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is tied those who havent look too many splatter pic should stay away as there are so many pic out there you could rent that are much more well deserving your while if you want something brainless lowbudget and fun rent something else stark waste of time with no redeem qualities any be smarter than i was at the time and dont be fooled by the warningnot for the faint of heart on the boxwood you have been warned
0,i cannot believe i actually sat through the whole of this movie it was dead awful and totally cringeworthy and yet i sat through it thinking it had to get better it didnt and i have wasted hours of my life will smith is practically better in fulfil motion picture show i loved him in i robot foe of the state and independence day and i dont think he can real be expected to carry off an intact movie as the romantic spark advance in the way that cary grant could then again the script was unbearably awful and the dialog was so cheap i dislike everyone except for prince albert character and regular that i found was answer with a heavy hand if you lack to watch a modern feelgood romantic comedy watch something like how to recede a guy in ten days or when harry met sally the year one time virgin left me with a smiling on my face i regular preferred medicine and words above this and yes i know its cheap but at least it didnt take itself seriously and was sweet i also dislike the main female spark advance and wasnt positive of the chemistry between her and will julia evelina smith character in all i think there were two scenes that i liked and definitely not the ending which was disgust and unconvincing hitch calling sarah when she hadnt given him her number was quite a sweet and no sorry thats the only thing i liked about the intact moving picture show dont waste your time

1,despite the feelings of most star wars fan in my judgement return of the jedi is the large cinematic film eer created eer since the first time i saw it its deepness intensity exceptional effects and moving write up have overwhelmed me the film was so well put together that it has been capable to stand the test of time over the last years filled with powerful legal action as the sexual climax of the original trilogy george v lucas gives us a rousing finish of the star wars saga in jedifilm drumhead contains spoilers for those who have not seen itafter the imperium strikes back left us hanging for long years we finally find the death of the write up in return of the jedi darth vader in excited turmoil makes a storm visit to a freshly uncompleted death star to oversee its construction the emperor moth is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the night side luke lando leia chewie and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord jabba the hutt after han has been rescued and jabba defeated luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he get a line the frightfully truth darth vader is in fact his don the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet now joined by other species and races including the mon calamary the rebels must make a allornothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed while lando heads the blank space attack in the millennium falcon the rebel heroes must invalid the death stars shield generator on the forest moon of endor it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry but mighty ewoks during the the deuce part intense battle a third battle must take place as luke volitionally delivers himself to vader in an try to convince him to farewell the night side in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his don as the emperor moth lure out his night emotion as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine vader flex on his arch master to save his logos lifespan filled with a deeply dateless write up of good vs evil return of the jedi is a dramatic emotionally charged film that redeem the good in all of us
1,i love this movie i watched it over and over when i rented it from netflixit had a lot of substance and meaning for me i think many people will enjoy iti have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say they are getting better and better in how they are presentedthey tend to have a more positive feel for the life style and feelings of gay womenits nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this societyi think it is apparent that more and more movies with this theme will grace our theaters and tv screensmany producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without hesitation
0,how can such good actors like jean rochefort and carole bouquet could have been involved in such a a well such a thing i cant get it it was awful very baldy played but some of the few leading roles the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny i wont talk more about this movie except for one little piece of advice do not go see it it will be a waste of time and money

1,when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of its century of the cinema series he grabbed the opportunity with both hands a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating wideranging and as the title says a highly personal look at hollywood cinemascorceses story is primarily about hollywoods directors actors producers screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention he states right from the beginning that for him the primary conflict within the film industry is that between the directors vision and the distributors profit motive between art and commercial viability he even opens with a clip from vincente minnellis the bad and the beautiful one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction this dictates the structure for the documentary scorcese looks at how genres have darkened and clichs have become challenged how mavericks have challenged the production code and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different however scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses he lavishes praise on cecil b de mille or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonethelessscorcese doesnt necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either orson welles and alfred hitchcock two of scorceses biggest influences are only mentioned in passing instead he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his story for example he shows us a succession of john ford films to show how the western evolved he looks at the work of vincente minnelli probably the most often referenced director of the documentary to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents i can imagine that had this assignment not been limited to america scorcese would have also loved to talk about for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell as it is he stretches the definition of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw murnau billy wilder and douglas sirk as well as the work of usborn filmmakers that was produced elsewhere such as that of stanley kubrickrather than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically scorcese compares films from various eras in order to tackle various subjects in his section on the language and tools of cinema he begins with dw griffith looks at the coming of sound colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects which although scorcese is not keen on them he is evenhanded enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them however he doesnt simply finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it instead he then rewinds back to the s to show how a lowbudget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest of elementsa personal journey through american movies has to be one of the best film documentaries made there were a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have discovered without and even the most seasoned of film buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope scorcese has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures i was pleased to see that when he talks about kubrick in his iconoclasts chapter he looks at lolita and barry lindon for me his two most underrated films scorceses respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully rather than just giving us tiny bits and he interrupts them with talking heads a combination of archive and new interviews only when necessary there is a bit of bias towards the s and s but that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema and after all i dont think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journeyone word of warning though in its in depth look at certain pictures this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers
0,steve carpenter cannot make horror movies first of all the casting was very wrong for this movie the only decent was the hot brown haired girl from the vampire slayer this movies no key ingredient a horror movie no acting and no suspensealso a key ingredient wes bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that its sad were a few parts that were supposed to be funnycontinuing the no one laughed the audience i thought that this movie was rated r and i didnt pay attention and realized it had been changed to anyway see this movie if you liked i still know what you did last summer thats the only type of person who would this movie remotely scary and seriously is to you steve carpenter stop making horror movies this look like texas chainsaw massacre
0,carlos mencia is not funny from his stand up specials to this train wreck of a tv series carlos mencia is not funny i have been trying to convince people for two years that he steals other comedians jokes and as far as his comedy material goes he is a regular johnnycomelately with far less than subpar results psycho astronaut jokes britney spears breakdown jokes i hope this is only a scheduling error but come on carlos and comedy central those topics and many others have run the gamut of late night tv show hosts opening monologues saturday night live mad tv and many many others lampooning ethnic and racial stereotypes comedy stands no chance of evolving with carlos mencia around perhaps people especially viewers and comedy central executives will get the point since this weeks issue of new york magazine accurately labeled him carlos mencia unrepentant jokefilcher
1,the art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current danish cinema well at least it is in this movie nobody in this movie are amused they are all either annoyed or shocked and if they arent yet they soon will be it is a story of screwups murder embarrassment dignity and in the end love and redemption the chilling awkward humorous style is idiomatic and wont appeal to everyone but personally i found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd you pity the characters from a distance even as you dislike them up close and personal but their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even when they get away with murderthis is in my judgment definitely the best danish movie of the last few years out of

1,a vernal young man named court is loved by everyone his painful bloody death brings define everyone closer you can find other keister symbols and allusions throughout the movie whether predictable or not and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs this is work a moving story full of milieu and sensualityone other thing someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didnt seem plausible but the elements for this are set up subtly allusion note what his mom says about bringing his lunch theater out to the field note decease how grievous he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment to this day tractors are court of law matter pretty dangerous

0,the story and show were good but it was really depressing and hate depressing movies richard is great he really put on a top notch performance and the who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile i cant say anything bad about peter galleghar hes one of my favorite actors i love anne im currently reading chronicles im glad i saw the movie before reading the book this is a little tooreal for me i prefer lestat and louiss witty little tiffs to the of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the sorry for the ambiguity but i dont want to give anything away sorry but its not my type of show
0,this film limps from self indulgent moment to self objective indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesnt its flat self conscious unimaginative and tediousa series of egotism set images and backdrops dont make in truth a film they make a calendar this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary its true lineament it really happened not only fails to entertain it fails to convince so it doesnt even function as social history clichs comingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional lone never developing chop chop to the ego extent that information technology one feels for them the go on directors ego is the atomic number largest character in this film
1,i still remember satya for the first i was completely blown here was a that was very different from the other gangster films i had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and believable despite company which a very good effort vaastav more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to satyawhen ab tak for the first time said to myself indian cops have their own isatya now the nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is ordinary film what strikes about the encounter at the start of the film the relaxed which it is carried there is a and feel to it cos you that it is of their routineab tak is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and feel to the movie editing seems nonexistent and hence effective the music is impressive and and stays with you long after youve left the hallbut for what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and character sandeep srivastava has done brilliant job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues im afraid ill end up rewriting the entire script the moviethe movie boasts of some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as subinspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was revelation the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot wounded gangster oh my god he learns under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes himprasad purandhare as zameer zafar is his conversations with sadhu are real jewels of writing never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation a cop a gangsternot that have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film this film pushed me a fan to a devotee nana inspector sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best ive ever seen in hindi cinema the way he talks to his expressions from the way he his cigarette the way sips his its almost as nana can do wrong he is at his best in each and every scene especially hes teaching jatin about the police force functions his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country its a that he did not win any popular awards for this onelast but in no way the least shimit amin does a brilliant of bringing all talent together and exploiting them to fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema in industry that sickeningly accustomed to lifting from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment i just that he continues the work and doesnt give in to bollywoodisation if do im be a force to reckon with in the
0,there are times when less than halfway through a i start to wonder what the creators were thinking that made decide not to burn every reel of footage and instead release a movie no real merit of any kind and i mean any kind this movie doesnt even hold up as madeforcable in fact heavens tears is and utterly boring and times a bit disturbing in its naivete the girl who is as i recall eighteen masturbates while of an older nazi who hit her with a carthe bumping into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert zemekis films then on their second third meetingget thishe is the shy one the one is resistant to the girls sexual advances and yet all she has to say im old enough im want to and he takes her to bed then after sleeping with this girl he knows he feels completed as if he could die right there in bed her and hed have a its lolita without a of social and personal commentarythe cinematography is the most boring part of the no interesting angles or originality at all not even for the sex scenes which are supposed to be the main draw for these the masturbation scene is a camera circling the girls bed very fake looking as its a stage and its with her fantasy of the man taking a shower in a waterfall the am scene is just a closeup of the right head down to her breasts with guy on top and its the same for the whole time even though there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazis older sister who has some kind of incestuous crush on him shes ridiculous silly so it doesnt matter i think the whole thing lasts to minutes and its neither enlightening nor arousing
0,i am a fan of the previous best of the best films but this one was awful no wonder i had such a hard time finding it i tried video rental stores until i found with copy this movie the acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as welli really miss alex grady travis and original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with first moviesjohn
1,here is an innovative television drama which so easily blends a compelling story brilliantly drawn out character development humour romance and drama into each episode here is a show that sings to its own tune whether its audience chooses to follow or not how many other shows on television these days so boldly change in tone from one season to the next where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works that brings in the viewers and the dollars and have stuck like glue to that formula prison break and desperate housewives come to mind lost takes a different route where even after achieving that plateau and that winning formula the team of executive producers are brave enough to completely reinvent the show in order to service their higher goal of compelling storytelling this is where lost differentiates itself from normal television this is how its so defiant of conventional tv and this is why lost is one of the most cutting edge and innovative creations of modern television forget the naysayers lost is has been and always will be there to appease its cult following first and the general public next but its a testament to its inventiveness that its garnered a fan base which consists of the best of both audiences
1,i enjoyed this movie a lot i thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had met cortland she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness the way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible id recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the underlaying meaning of the movie and plot
1,as another one of recent overthetop dramas brought upon us by hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failedespecially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character by that of natalie portman this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both natalie share they to be so natural during the that you would mistake them for a real family they through so many motherdaughter conflicts in story its kind hard to pick up on their acting abilities i that these two actress talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar full of cliches and really saved the suffering plot i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of two actresses or such overthetop dramas
1,yeah this nee films is tops cant recommend kickoff festive it more gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film very funny sad and interesting never dull great access a nee film made with passion and interest in the subject matter some of the performances associate in nursing and just amazing if patois you only find this film on vhs it live is still very live worth watching great neer out of i got to see racecourse part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching the interviews are coif very revealing about egos neer of the performers who are like heavy weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement cool track it down
0,the previews were so funny that i couldnt wait to see this movie i just got home and i have to say i couldnt have been more embarrassed at this movie yes there were times where the jokes were funny but the stereotypical roles were painful joan plowright is a fine actress but the scene with the negro spiritual was just in poor taste needless to say the laughs were few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd i was one of a very small handful of blacks
0,this is the worst film i have ever seen so bad it is astonishing i am glad that i have never seen that black in any other film ok it fault that someone gave him those lines but he could have the role and to learn how to act instead how did anyone get money to film together there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain oh yeah they will love this one its got no believable some kungfu chuck norris black sidekick with bad corny lines sweet little israeli or is he arab or does anyone care boy and brilliant and many thanks to all concerned enriching the human
1,one of the most underrated comedies dan akroyd is hilarious in this over the top role charles grodin gives a performance nearly as good as in midnight run and walter matthau gives a superb comedic performance in this sometimes subdued sometimes wacky film akroyd and matthau have great chemistry together
1,ive seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with itthe conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually isalthough certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandableluckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understandi would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it
1,i have just recently read the novel mother night ive owned the videodisk for some time now and watch it every so often few movies i own and have assure have pee pee me recollect and question as much as mother night has i am amazed at the brilliance not only of vonnegut but of the rendering of his text to screendo not rent or watch this movie on vhs it moldiness be manage on videodisk and it moldiness be follow by the directors comment on the motion picture to construe how they took a fairly bare story yet complex in its substance and dialogue and pee pee it make so advantageously i recollect any viewer will be amazedthe omissions in the movie are few from the text and do not take away from it much the movie mightiness as advantageously be the book and is the best adaptation i have ever assure i so extremely recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch itit will change you if you do
1,a labor of love each frame is picture perfect and grabs you then the sheer emotion and storytelling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie the director gets your heart and leads it through minutes of visual poetry you are a part of the emotional ride of the characters i have seen this movie at festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing the remarkable storytelling transcends nationality and language and i felt i was a part of the drama unfolding before me the casting is as perfect as one can get vijay raaz camille and benoit each hold their own i strongly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates good cinema i cant wait for the commercial release of this movie

1,i enjoyed this film a lot i thought that the patch of the film was naturalistic and relevant to anytime geological period in american history there is always that woman that does what she pauperization to do to go up the class system i feeling that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done punter what i enjoyed most was when she agnize what love really was throughout the film all of the valet that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had cope with cortland she did not realise why these valet gave up everything for felicity the way her life had ended up was former armed forces from what she expected to be possible id recommend this film to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to realise the content and the underlaying significant of the film and patch
0,oh my oh this is the really bad movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the script is godawful and the photography is simply dreadfulwhat does make this movie stand this however is that you never pensive care about part single soul good guy and actually made living of or dead in the entire minutes muster she died huh figured they would was directorwriter best reaction i could oh after each murder characters along so blackorwhite that with the volume turned off you could still figure out who was who while the casts voices had an odd monotone quality throughout whatever faces give the impression that youre looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling creation frowns and once it each character is a humorless passionless onedimensional plays pony once they fulfill their watch no role in this fiasco demanded their exaggerated they to summarily dismissedit one gruesome me think dying and would happen if thomas borch nielsen a of skyggen american title webmaster decided are do a it version of american psycho and got vaguely safe distracted are the waythis isnt a particularly guy movie the cold passionless cast ensures that it isnt an offensive movie the director onetrick lowbudget so of that particular kind could possibly find it so looks is simply what after all a bad movieavoid it we were not so fortunate or bad paid to their out bomb on payperview as a of my penance im writing this reviewenough said

1,this is so exciting after i saw la roue this afternoon a short lighthearted little movie i consider this one a real treat this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the s to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema its simply filled with music and an adorable mood thats really upbeat and bottom line it made me happy obviously it wouldnt be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i didnt even think of it twice the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the time this is rather perfect
0,was this supposed to be funny this is one of those films that just doesnt work the first one bruce almighty with jim carey had some very funny moments this one had nonesteve carrell who was brilliant in bruce almighty fails to deliver here his performance is very ordinary and he cant carry it off like carey didthe one good thing about this is i only paid to rent it its a movie for childrenvery young children who have only seen about films or so in their short livesits interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a film and they make a sequel without him that its usually a huge turkey anyone remember son of mask imdb worst films of all time avoid this one movie lovers
0,i had high prospect for this flick and was activated about renting it but was very disappointed when i saw it it was very poorly written and sort of just descend apart there wasnt a lot of good anything in this flick except maybe special effects
0,oh boy this movie is so mediocre i dont really know what exactly to write about it i think its easier to write what its not its not very entertaining its not original and theres not one character in the whole movie i cared aboutkind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv but without any interesting people it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end the only thing that kept me from switching it off was jennifer lyons ci thought a long time about this movie to find one good thing to say about it what i liked was the reminder not to judge a person by the first impression you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of out of instead of a
0,a root canal without anesthesia is more amusing this movie is disturbing and pointless there is absolutely nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot line what in gods name were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie the acting in this movie is so incredibly bad even from actors who are usually pretty damn good the inlaws is a funny movie the birdcage is a hilarious movie the big lebowski is a humorous movie this movie is just dumb i cannot even begin to fathom the kind of sick mind it takes to write the novel that this movie is based on i honestly cannot think of even one nice thing to say about this movie it just doesnt make any sense people please i beg of you do not see this movie you will regret it for the rest of your life this movie is not the worst ever made but it is definitely right up there on the top of the list
1,bye bye birdie isnt one of the best musicals of all time but its great fun and accessible to many audiences the original film could have been wonderful with dick van dyke reprising his signature broadway role but instead they tinkered with the plot so the film is very unsatisfying this remake which aired on abc in is far more faithful to the original script and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred tommy tune and ann reinking who choreographed this filmjason alexander is a very different type from dick van dyke but he is well cast as albert before his seinfeld days he started in musical theater vanessa williams is a perfect fit for rose their is also great work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie a role he played on the national tourthis film is not without its problems though a major liability is chynna phillips who however appealing simply looks and seems too old to be teenage kim and george wendt is somewhat bland as her father somewhat throwing the number kids away a number original cast member paul lynde stole the show withbut all in all this is a delightful welldone film which the material deserved
1,i finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through and i must say i was very impressed michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actressesits not only the fact that cluster she can act but that she chooses the roles best suited to her interahamwe that are more meaningful and important far than what would first seem ive read well nigh a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand but i certainly disagree diana is a feminist gustatory modality she follows her dreams and believes in live herself contrary to lilliputian what practically everyone around her thinks with the totally exception of her caring bouncy brother tiny and her trainer and manager hector who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent which is what the word feminism is all about only its good to see films like this showcasing the true side tiny of feminismthat theyre not a pic bunch crony of manhating losersbut that they live live have dreams and strong arm can do anything diana is true cipher to herself while still assign falling prey to love and she and adrian have a more realistic complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works lawful out girlfight is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into atomic number my perception of people thanks michelle a very important movie thats relatable lawful look to not just young women but everyone wanting to go far in their lives
1,this is a beautiful funny bright film its even better than nuovo cinema paradiso which it parallels but doesnt replicate the story make out a full circle and had the theater glow as the credits rolled a hundred years after this story takes place were just as connive by quiver images in a dark theater
1,great film a very worthy tom hanks was at his usual best the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors based upon a true story tells us how the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away well it did go away albeit temporarily look who we the british amongst others are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms training and money to in the sthis film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice story however once the main objective is achieved ie ridding the communists from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten aboutthis film was good it was a well deserved it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the us to some detail and was dramatised well although being a good film i will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good us v evil russia isnt your thing

0,curiously and of the columbo series contained only groomed episodes and there looks very little evidence security quality in at least two of the scripts based when this outing for the to and also fade into penned turns is not a coincidence that peter many feibleman murderfurthermore both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays celestes part of script murdered of pay herethis adventure is very rarely compelling and s commodore the performers just look disinterested with the material rather to is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods a boring conversationcolumbo is also shadowed by a colleague heresimilar to last salute is the of but the entertainment value is minimal to add the this the holm characterisation which is intended to provide comedy induces embarrassment arguably than laughsthe to wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough bill gift columbo the case in there is never a produces discussion has to script motives of her crimeironically what season out story be the columbos worst adventure credible the funniest moment in the series he quizzes a male hairdresser and relating a haircutmanicure at the same time the next minutes are hilarious its just that columbos hair is so perfectly three then he cant afford maninthemac guard the to it then on he makes enquiries at of jewellers he keeps glancing though the mirror to admire his hairstylesadly this is the only decent moment from a the that to like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes for columbo completionists only
0,how can such good actors like jean rochefort group a and carole bouquet could have been involved in such a a conk well such a thing i cant get it it was awful very baldy played but some of the few leading roles the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny i wont talk more about this movie except for information technology one little piece of advice set out do not go see it suspect it will be a wish waste of time and money

0,one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
0,the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents not visually stunning actually visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady well maybe id recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment
0,i have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely its burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over years old the story never really seems to make much sense especially when robicheaux played by tommy lee jones starts having his conversations with confederate general john bell hood i never really did figure that out jones was ok in his role although i thought he was really starting to show his age here horribly miscast was john goodman as julie baby feet balboni who i guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure i simply didnt think goodman worked in this role although ill admit that just could be because im not much of a john goodman fan somewhere in the mix appeared justina machado as an fbi agent although i never really did understand what the fbi was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen if it was explained though i missed it completely fortunately this is a fairly short movie so you wont waste too much of your life on it
1,not all movies are oscar worthy but lets face it sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression this one left me smiling and happy and i couldnt wait to hug my own son anyone who has had a pet no matter what type knows what it feels like to lose one i believe most people would identify with buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth bruce willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and joey lauren adams was convincing as a good mother the little boy who played buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend edgar played terrific backup roles liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy thanks
0,first of all this plot is way overdone daughter wants to work it everyone loves her snobby daughter interpose all looks lost daughter pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male person squeeze on the heroine plus singleparent troubles and its so predictable that you can practically recite along with itsecond of all i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music they send off out the message that everyone imply in classical music is uptight and snobby and closeminded in fact i dont recall the quote exactly but i think back at one channelize in the flick holly articulate why do they have to be so uptightso classical its really insulting how label classical music in this waythird ive went over it dozens of times but the only reason that i can think of for making this flick is to promote britney fizgig there just isnt any channelize at alland ohio yea while the actress who portrayed holly im not certainly whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably proficient voice it wasnt as stick as they were making it out to be specially when she was belt she was oversupporting the whole time headliner
0,wow this really is stereotypical terrible trash i feel sorry for anyone who may have wasted their money to see thisi am pretty sure i did not laugh once during this whole movie i just cannot believe they would make such a terrible moviei will now be more wary when i watch late night moviesthis is most definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i am not saying it is the worst movie in existence though it could be but i dont think i have seen anything so stupid and unfunny it my life it makes the scary movie series look intelligent id give it a if they would let me
0,when i saw the pine tree state poster at the theater i thought that it is a new put line of a horror story without a famous cast worth giving a try but after i went in i wanted to leave after minutes there was a eve lot of nonsense and logical flaws to information technology instant me taste it is a movie that is not worth putting in theaters it is not even worth seeing
1,the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity is in top as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan opera i dare to say that he performs some better than caruso check avuchella from tosti and danza from the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of blyth we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should less demanding also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of leading soprano
0,this film is really terrible a are in it is terrible waste about minutes documentary your life film effects are so terrible the acting wasnt convincingits of a crocodile that attack a blood when as they are filming a of about blood surfing view surfing is seeing they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a more crocodile interrupts there holiday fill sharks dont creature real the crocodile is even worse and it gets even foot pathetic when they are running away form the look but the crocodile gets stuck and females flash it the deaths are fake and the pirates as just to the in timea pointless terrible special thats not worth tourists
0,i really cant understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than star how can you like such a retarded film where all the animal abuse scenes are real i dont even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments jesus what kind of human would torture them like that for no reason or just for money i tell you that director is either mentally retarded or hes just a monster with a heart of stone or both he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn aliveit contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the waterthis movie is more than awful it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called cannibal holocaust or something like that ill never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster no one should waste their time watching it especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there in which all the animal abuse scenes are stagedfortunately only a few people liked this which is natural since its the worst film ever so it wasnt successful i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel humans will feel the same pain they once inflicted to othersthis however is probably my only negative review i usually dont comment on a movie if i dislike it but this time i just couldnt shut up i had to speak the truth because animal abuse must stop
1,although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about custer the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best
1,the really is movie really well parts one which a great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot especially thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is is is character watch and it especially should be able this appreciate the overall of it and as passion for cinema that beautifullyit being put into itits hard to place some to under one label its not movie a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style but does things its own way it doesnt its follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from this different genres combinedbut just like the movie feels main great original movie gets sort of slow and boring in made the artistic out of directing tries movie conceal to the story is actually a quite simple one and necessarily also the if the too relied solely on they style and beauty atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt make the a horrible or anything that its just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the trying more its as if its movie that be too poetic let tries to and the images speak movie much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works style is features some great camerawork and many unique storytelling which makes to an the as well as a great film to watch
0,this movie was a total yawnfest that took forever to get going but never really did it was simply boring to watch so much in fact i could just never really get into it this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination the cover of the videotape made it out to be one instead it is a thriller type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to make the movie more interesting of course it does not help this movie at all mostly all i remember is that this movie was kind of like a movie from the s called the deep bunch of looking for treasure rival groups that sort of thing there are supernatural twists in it too but to tell you the truth i was so bored when watching this movie that i kind of zoned out so i can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea so maybe it was some sort of walking dead or that may be me thinking of lucio fulcios zombie movie instead as that one was a horror movie that was set in a tropical island and as outlandish as that one was it was a lot more entertaining than this movie that day we learned a valuable lesson never rent a movie based on its cover art
1,excellent film suzy kendall will it hope interest throughout has not been shown on american tv for a decade they scene that has always stayed with me is tape german cavalry gas attack you will find others your one soon put hold on the
0,there are times when less than halfway through a movie i start to wonder what the creators were thinking that made them decide not to burn every reel of footage and instead release a movie that has no real merit of any kind and i mean any kind this movie doesnt even hold up as madeforcable porn in fact heavens tears is completely and utterly boring and at times a bit disturbing in its naivete the girl who is as i recall eighteen masturbates while thinking of an older nazi who hit her with a carthe bumping into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert zemekis films then on their second or third meetingget thishe is the shy one the one who is resistant to the girls sexual advances and yet all she has to say is im old enough im want to and he takes her to bed then after sleeping with this girl he hardly knows he feels completed as if he could die right there in the bed with her and hed have lived a full life its like lolita without a shred of social and personal commentarythe cinematography is the most boring part of the movie no interesting angles or originality at all not even for the sex scenes which are supposed to be the main draw for these kinds of movies the masturbation scene is just a camera circling the girls bed very fake looking as if its on a stage and its interspliced with her fantasy of the man taking a shower in a waterfall the i am completed scene is just a closeup of the girls right side head down to her breasts with the guy on top of her and its the same shot for the whole time even though there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazis older sister who has some kind of incestuous crush on him shes ridiculous and silly so it doesnt matter i think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes and its neither enlightening nor arousing
1,great documentary of how scientists believed dinosaurs behaved captured with some of the most spectacular cgi since jurassic park done completely seriously like a prehistoric episode of nation geographic grabs your attention from the first frame and never lets go my favorite part was when the diplodocus fights off the allosauros stars this is what science is all about
1,if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked itgreat camp
0,i watched the film recently and it poorly resembles the book is based on i blame this on poor screenplay and direction some parts were forcibly introduced the gay rape scene for no apparent reason i actually read the book after watching the movie and some years or so after reading it for the first time i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit at all other than sensational parts for the time as it covers stuff that was deemed isensitive to say the least during communism i can see the fascination it produced at the time that isnt the case anymore though or maybe i see things differently now or a bit of both the film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book the result being a concoction of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made
0,this drollery is really not funny it a butterfly that plays so much on stereotype it name no impact its a caper film so derivative yes even back then it has no snapthe cast is adequate more than that its hard to say however whats nice is that the musician are unfamiliar at mgm this would have asterisk robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no meter for anything but work could have been any list of actresseswe can be grateful that this slight known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful in time it name no genuine impressionits a generic knockoff and who wants that
1,this movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public this movie dramatizes that point a conservative whitecollar advertising company is taken over by a group of streetwise african americans chaired by a nononsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth but the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different the market place and the political system demands that he conform rendering him no different than his predecessors interesting offbeat movie
1,this is a really interesting film its the first time i have seen the relationship between an older woman and a younger guy on screen without it being sensationalist for the director of notting hill this is a bold move to something serious
1,it occurred to me while the final conniption of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of buddy charles hardin holley decease that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in clearlake iowa who recollect it vividly that has to be a haunting memory lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of american english proto indo european as it pays tribute to the daylight the music pass away the world lost some tremendous talent that daylight lives cut short mode before their prime and one can only wonder what power have been if the of musicians who perished that daylight had hold up to create an even greater musical legacyi follow the film today some xxx years after its original theatrical release xxx years i have some unhinge wrapping my mind around that i had forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little thing like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the bands identify but most of all i recollect the music its hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of oh boy or thatll be the daylight and one has to wonder just where the threat to our ethical motive power have really come from with those tune up im with buddy on that hit at least how could they be jungle rhythms if he number up with them comic how each consecutive decade make for its own threat to the textile of club the beatles motown disco music and a unanimous server of other musical forms were still take heed and dancing to the beat so i guess they couldnt have been all that badthere was some other takeaway from the film i had forgotten about this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasnt seeing thing my mode ive done that a number of times over the years but by now had forgotten the source well i should be good for some other xxx years or so nowyou certainly have to pay gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly seeing him today one could never guess him as the slimmed down rocker with the automobile horn rimmed glasses but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned busey an academy award nod don stroud and charles martin kate smith are competent as buddys ring members though their characters demand a back seat to practically of the story i enjoyed the insidious ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture names like sam cooke and king curtis without ever so consist on their presence ill always be a fan and follower of music from the fifty and oldies they call them now i guess that form me a bit of an oldie too but you camber exchange the experience of growing up with the music history that now form it to the big concealment which only goes to reenforce the idea that ill keep on enjoying the music until well the daylight i die
1,this showtime cable film features a talented cast and weaves together several storylines involving the darker side of new york from the naive and innocent tourists nightmarish adventure to a pair of undercover cops on the streets to an old friends betrayal it has it allwell worth a look as is its sequel
0,i thought this movie was going to be good it absolutely wasnt despite the oscarwinning lead actors i may have laughed once and i never heard anybody else in the theater laughing renee zellwegers pancake makeup was very unbecoming everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off i think perhaps the movie mustve sounded good in development but something got lost in translation were the roaring s really like this i think not everything seems a tad artificial randy newmans score was annoying the film is in sepia tones just like every other movie that takes place in the s or s theres just not that much originality here
0,this is just a very bad film miles looks as if she is in pain during the sex scenes and the acting is wooden it also drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all one of the worst films that i have ever seen
0,man what a scam this turned out to be not because it wasnt any good as i wasnt really expecting anything from it but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its stars as being stuart whitman stella stevens and tony bill sure enough their names did not appear in the films opening credits much less themselves in the rest of it as it turned out the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybodys guess even so since i paid for its rental and i was in a monstermovie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup it stunk apart from the fact that it had a noname cast and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jawslike pretensions and intentionally so at the resistible antics of two moronic layaboutscumboat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on the creature itself a plesiosaur ie halfdinosaurhalffish is imperfectly realized naturally but as had been the case with the giant claw which ive also just seen this didnt seem to bother the filmmakers none as they flaunt it as much as they can especially during the movies second half
1,but unusually straightfaced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously imperfect as is to be expected from a film more work ability a tight budget but the in is involving its actors of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax or more max or whatever they call it character end up watching minute blocks when youre supposed the be going to shot along w this chopping years and the assault a reminder that who is a much more which fellow than many has his really lowbudget brethern wynorski of a real deathstalker to pace a genre film when own actuallys interested in the house ie dont bother watching any of his shannon tweed on cormonlike a or a after the title one whove had too silly to do recently mancuso ford even gary sandy for chrissakes to put their all into some of their best roles in mall he for grieco he has the right look although his acting is a bit onenote its clear his you is supposed director be selfdestructing throughout the film albert some doesnt quite convey it and checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote sorority material massacre dinosaur island for to director both minor classics drama their through rights but obviously little overlooked with cinema flicks ones clearly like grieco of the better jonathan straighttovideo and jonathan kaplan bpictures of the heatseeker giving you the exploitation element but when involving drama at the same time a real step forward not citizen kane i the comic final moments are a bit disruptive but a wellwritten characterdriven aboveaverage demme actioner small achievements like this should not be easy offering they come along talented is rare enough as i was reminded as i tried to sit as an an pyun monstrosity called s the other night this lowbudget stuff isnt as roger as it looks but thats another story
1,it movie made sincerely very happy its impossible not to love the me and sweet touched girl who changes the heart of a selfish lawyer only interested in pursuing success in her career this is a very optimistic movie this i smart believe that we need more films like curly sue and orphan my heart
0,the protector you hear the name you think ah its a crappy hong kong movie guess what its not hong kong and yes it is crappy this amazingly stupid jackie chan film ruined by us yes us the americans im boiling with anger ooh i think ill jump out that window has chan as a new york cop hunting down a gang avenging the death of his buddy sounds coolbut its not dont waste your money renting it to prove he could make a better cop film chan made the amazing police story
0,a smile like yours is a pathetic comedy that actually makes no sense i dont mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot is based on one thing a couples desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children people who tried that hard mustve forgotten of the option of the adoption to which this movie is not kind tolauren holly plays jennifer robertson a complete contradiction to anything offered by the womens liberation movement exhibiting almost no sense of independence she is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her mind but to have kids like a dumb s romance comedy greg kinnear is her submitting husband who likewise displays no personality no independence and from us no interestthey are the two most boring and often annoying characters and they hardly make for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps which should arise from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant except they really dont do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own except for that in vitro fertilization number the plot hardly allows for any mishaps because well the couple dont do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation they just go to this clinic so whatthe subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend played by joan cusak and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs christopher macdonald plays the intrested buyer and jennifer is the promising negotiator of a pretty price for her and her friends product the subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested although joan cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scenedanny kinear is an architect who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills by taking on a job in seattle where his boss is the crass seductress also another hopeless helpless female character who tries to influence danny as dumb as he is to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons i dont care to give away jill hennesy is good in the role but her character is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for danny it is stupid and once again hardly interesting the overall movie itself is utterly boring and hardly funny at all save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight the plot offers nothing that is really attentiongrabbing even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive the writers couldve figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that second the main characters are completely boring they are complete silouhettes of dumb s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband so even without mishaps present in the plot the characters themselves offer nothing interesting let alone funnyjoan cusak shouldve been in the lead and someone else shouldve taken kinnears part cusak wouldve made even a lousy story outrageously funny as she sometimes does in her costarring role here this is definitely one to pass up
1,the acting in this movie was superb but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart worth seeing when you put the movie in its proper context
0,i have never watched a movie in so little time the only salvation was the fast forward function on the dvd unit it was like watching a poorly produced cbc film there was obviously no money for lighting filming sets location scriptwriters editors actors oh there was absolutely no story either i need to write ten lines of comment bad awful horrible wretched anguishing tortuous bilious nauseous sickening fromage disgusting flimsy icky yucky pukey stinky smelly vile putrid allthumbsdown and i dont know if i can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crapomatic production was
0,this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen dangerous and i have hale quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it consistently had been consistently tongueincheek la rocky horror picture show live which was bike really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to look pic adlib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent systematically interpretation that of the older jejune ghoulbusting broad on compare the motorcycle
0,maybe james p lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director supervises himin dreamland however he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a directorthere is absolutely nothing in this film no story no character building no events no atmosphere no plot no twists no acting that deserves that namein any of those departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some actual thinking in it even a one minute oneit has nothing to do with any of david lynchs worksi actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the westrecommend it only to your worst enemies
0,i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldnt watch it was because of the actors firstly for the most part they just looked stiff and im sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame but thats a minor issue the main issue i have with the actors isnt really their fault its whoever cast this film come on this movie came out in i thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave i cannot watch a movie where one of the first lines from a grown man older than myself is im how can anyone take that seriously dont fall victim to this movie go out for a walk for minutes and youll get far more than this movie could ever give
1,great film aboutthis very worthy tom hanks was at his usual best the heavy serious congressman who saved afghanistan to its communist achieved based upon a look story tells i forgotten the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away well it did go away albeit temporarily true who we the british is others are now fighting the very people people who the us gave arms training and money to in us sthis film was always going from provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice story however once the main objective amongst oppressors ie people afghanistan communists from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of people is how a film was good it was a well deserved ridding told the story same is communist invasion of drinking and the subsequent covert operation by not us to some detail and thing dramatised well although being a good film us will recommend it to it but some of will the enjoy it particularly the a the film about good the v evil russia isnt your was
1,the day time ended is an incredible picture in some ways its better than close encounters of the third kind i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars the special effects are cheesy but thats a big part of the fun jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film its probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature the musical score is very good the story doesnt make sense but that only makes it all the more intriguing like many of the best works of art the day time ended isnt afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the day time ended may be a low budget indie film but it isnt too much of a stretch to compare it with the existential european films of the fifties and sixties many of which were low budget independent productions themselves
0,i have to say that this movie was not what i expected even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with with the title ruins you would think that out of years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit this is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most but not a crocodile either way this film was like that it entices you to think about ruins of mayan or inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect but plants come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd as for this movie it will hit the b list in no time i have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see but it didnt make up for the rest of the film and a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects i do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense the thing had a better story line than this did even the ring had me jumping for more but the ruins is just that ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers the premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder
1,presque rien is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual eschewing both stereotypes and preaching its a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place never melodramatic but often painfully real if anything its almost too realistic as theres little in the way of conventional plot just scenes from a life but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn presque rien might not be the most exciting film ever made but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the preconceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme worth a watch
0,i have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely its burdened with a plot that revolves around mysterious murders of several women which then gets linked the discovery of a body over years old the story never really seems to make much sense especially when robicheaux by tommy lee jones starts having conversations with confederate general john bell hood never really did figure that out jones was ok in his role although i thought he was really starting to show his age here horribly miscast was john goodman as julie baby feet balboni who i guess is supposed be some sort of local mob figure i simply didnt think worked in this role although ill admit that just could because im not much of a john goodman fan somewhere in mix appeared justina machado an fbi agent although i never really did understand what the fbi was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen if it was explained though i missed it fortunately this is a fairly short so you wont waste too much your life on it
0,i am definitely a burt reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie i cant believe he even made this one is he actually that hard up for money
0,the story and the show were good but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies richard is great he really put on a top notch performance and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile i cant say anything bad about peter galleghar hes one of my favorite actors i love anne rice im currently reading the vampire chronicles but im glad i saw the movie before reading the book this is a little tooreal for me i prefer lestat and louiss witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry for the ambiguity but i dont want to give anything away sorry but its just not my type of show
0,this is just look a group a very bad film miles looks as if she is in pain during the sharpen sex scenes and the acting is wooden it real also drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all one of the worst films that i have ever seen
0,the threesome of bill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal who sells salt water taffy with the outbreak of world war i the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked oneliners and isnappy dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a uboat these sequences are lively and wellfilmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only
1,i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every fiber of a human being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was wills best performance to date great directing liked the editing music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get something wonderful from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action films can have a caring story i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see somethingsomeone that cared about other people more than himself
1,fulci is unrivalled of my all metre favorite italian splatter managing director he is also a very unspoilt level teller mixing horror the supernatural and psychedelic themes in all very comfortably this film was truly his last great level before he directed such letdown as vocalise from beyond the level is simple as fulci run himself a horror director after years of filming splatter and panel films it appear that fulci starts to sustain a breakdown in which he starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered he decide to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces fulci that he is killing peoplefulci used panel scenes from several pictures roughly the same metre these films i dont believe he directed but certainly produced some of those films are massacre directed by andrea bianchi burying soil touch of death directed by fulci the murders secret and i cant remember the rest of the filmsnightmare concert is a very underrated film even by fulci fans but i loved this movie and have look out it many times already it is sad that fulci didnt get a chance to direct anything charles frederick worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci devotee whether you like it or not mavin
0,i about watched this especially because is a big kinski fan but oh my god dont get me wrong i love this guy but scream this movie his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work but fortunately he isnt the only one to blame first of all thats complete in im totally weak dealing movie its gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck thats kinski jail for a crime he did not all the didnt commit the dialogs and characters are so bad totally making you storyline but maybe up the fun of it all if you know the kinskibiography its obvious that in all care recently those movies at all with all his italowestern roles he genre took the money and that was it again this whole movie is a weird only for hardcorefans of the just
1,this is the best directtodvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van dammes best costar scott adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre for further evidence check out undisputed adkins is so good in fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen van damme holds his own though and although he isnt quite as athletic as adkins is he can still kick with the best of them all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van dammes characters motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit the reason he does is very cool but you dont find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it aint character development overall though this is a solid action movie that i recommend so run for the damme border
0,the dvd version released by crash cinema was very poorly done the mastering engineer must have been either drunk asleep or not even in the room while it was being done it looks like it was mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the film the audio synchronization disappears the dialog is about or seconds behind the audio if youre thinking about purchasing this dvd please save your money i remember seeing this film at the theater back in also the vhs copy of this film under the title of when taekwondo strikes looks better than the dvd but the remaining several minutes of the movie are missing where is the original camera negative
1,this film is about so many things most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic there is also the tense relationship between china and the west as many chinese saw probably rightly so the barbarians as trying to take over and pollute their way of life liu even seeks to preserve their way of life on film because he sees that it will one day disappear their is also lius internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of china versus the selfdetermination philosophy of the west all these themes are woven quite skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole by hu a very enjoyable film
0,i had high expectations for this movie and was excited about renting it but was very disappointed when i saw it it was very poorly written and sort of just fell apart there wasnt a lot of good anything in this movie except maybe special effects
1,when i was a kid i totally loved both bill ted movies the other night bogus journey was on and since it was at least years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years excellent adventure is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way plus it features the coolest personation of death ever in a movie concluding totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station
1,the day time ended is an incredible pic in some ways its safe than unaired face off of the third genial i favor sleazy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars the special effects are sleazy but thats a big part of the fun jim davis render an excellent performance in this film its probably one of the best roles he ever so had in a feature the musical score is very good the story doesnt name sense but that only makes it all the more intriguing ilk many of the best works of art the day time ended isnt afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the day time ended may be a low down budget indie film but it isnt too much of a stretch to compare it with the existential european picture show of the fifties and sixties many of which were low down budget independent product themselves
1,the acting in this movie was superb but mixed with the accuracy about the train of many africans in south africa take it pump wrenching it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena river from others run from their homes so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew unitedly and apart worth experience when you put the movie in its proper context
0,robin williams is splendid in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him this may study if you buy into the usa number one outlook but story wise nothing much happens rather a shame really since the movie is really stress to say something and says it sincerely it just doesnt wad enough emotional punch
1,i first saw this movie when i was about years old it has been one my favorites so perfect in all glory complete with awesome soundtrack cheesy dialog and it both hilarious and terribly sad the first movie i really just had a fit about at the end i wont ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker i just remember feeling so sad for gary what a bunch cool characters in this its genius they are all so great even the nerdy girl doesnt likeshe had a nice little body though i cant believe all the girls go he is a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck ha ha ha when watching movie be for lots sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseasesalmost but a love story at heart real problems dealing from insecurity to life altering that make you think and genuine sorrow for the cast i this movie you like valley girl another all time classic you will too
1,excellent film suzy kendall will hold your interest throughout has not been shown on american tv for a decade one scene that has always stayed with me is the german cavalry gas attack you will find others hope they soon put it on tape

0,with title like this you know you get pretty much lot of junk acting bad script bad director bad grammar badmovie make lot of noise that really not music and lot of people yell movie make bad racial stereotype why come every movie with black hero have drug addict why come hero always have to dance to be success why come famous rapper always have to be in dance movie why come letter s cant be in titlehollywood need to stop dumb down audience and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper englishdo self favor and not go see
0,impenetrable rubbish this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the dialogue is ghastly the effects are laughable the thing that kept me watching was the eversplendid and underrated cule
0,smithereens is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library a worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director seidelman the film is fraught with bad acting bad sound bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of lifes great mysteries d

1,liked stanley iris very much acting was violence good story had a unique and interesting arrangement very absence of very and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could their understand feelings the enjoyable movie
0,this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying its quite obvious why former courteous this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated rerunsmost of its dwarf plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think reasonably the producers didnt have an original idea in their heads i havent commented enough youve set out got to have school text at least ten lines of text information technology thoroughly the special effect were school principal not bad for a showthe gnome was a nice character
0,hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally have not seen this movie i mean there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast shoddy special effects i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio a high school drama club could probably come out with a better product i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this dribble dont they read scripts i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last man standing i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light of day

0,a root canal without in that location anesthesia is more amusing this movie is disturbing and pointless there is absolutely nothing matter believable about world health organization any live of these characters or the plot line what in gods name were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie the acting in this movie is so incredibly bad even from actors who are life history usually pretty damn good the inlaws is a funny movie in that location the birdcage is a hilarious movie the live big lebowski is pic a humorous movie this movie is just dumb matter reasonably i cannot even sol begin to fathom the kind of sick mind it takes to plot of land write sound the novel that this movie is based on i honestly cannot think of even one nice thing to say about this movie it just doesnt group a make any sense people please i uproarious beg of you do not see this movie pic you will regret it for the rest of your life this movie is not the worst ever made but it coif is definitely right up there on the top of the list
1,i remember seeing this movie as a child in the s it took my breath away then at young age i was glued to my seat in front of the black and white tv the cast was one of the best i have seen in my life the musical was one the greatest ever have been written please to the gershwin and goldwyn families please release this on video or dvd so that the generations now and in the future can experience what im sure what so many of us have done when we saw this great work of art please consider let not this great mans work go unseen for years more im praying and hoping that the hearts of these families will be soften and let the world see this great movie again
0,honestly buying this movie was a waste of money its one of the most boring movies i have seen in my life the only part i liked is the ending but its so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie
0,this movie is lame and not funny at all the plot doesnt even make sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously shes more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie im sure the topless girls doesnt hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is a gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing i didnt like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i dont recommend watching it though it was just too stupid i cant think of any part of the movie that was good
1,i first saw this when and was a teen in my last year of junior high trigger was looks to it the loved chrono wonderland effects the fantastic places and the trialaspect and flashback much of telling the storyseveral years by i and the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say i think that while its not as perfect as i book for social from as sheep story the movie is better it makes more sense to have it be one an commentary than having gulliver return after and voyage sheep making a profit later selling the tiny lilliput each or whateverits much more arresting when everyone thinks hes crazy and the a do make a cameo anyway as a side note when i saw laputa i was stunned it riveted very method like the kingdom of zeal adventure the the i video game that also made me like this miniseries even morei nbc it again about years ago and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much really high quality stuff excellent began long read run of sweeps miniseries for saw who followed it interesting with the solid merlin i up alice in special
0,diane lane is beautiful and sexy and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and thats being generous the story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolvingset in lets say a suburb of newark the plot would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and positano and a film of the whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world
0,annie potts is the only highlight in early truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really makes that someone stole the corvette he take in classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the and looking car to be featured his who movie ugliest heads upset to las vegas with annie to track down potts if genius a has stolen his pride and joyi a have plucked out my eyes after her this evil it wasnt for the fun of watching annie the in a very this role and its too bad for hamill that he didnt and a few acting lessons from watching danny bonaduce also off would goofy cameo
0,at least the jingle by tim finn was melodic roberts is the his usual inept self characters are inconsistent numb purposeless roberts changes his accent even within one ancestry
1,from the offset i knew this was going to be a terrific movie the pace the cinematography personalities indigenous to the dallas area the diversification of characters not to mention the director oliver stone and of course eric bogasianthe film starts out on a friday suggestively occult in the first place and begins with a radio station in dallas that is hosting their number one talk show the barry champlain show based on the talk radio host alan bergbarry eric bogasian is the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the radio audience feeding into his showhe attempts to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have the masochistic craving to be publicly vilified barry champlain is effective in coping with this precarious ilk by socially debasing them rather than simply subjugating them to mere admonishmentnew technologies serve a stigmatic purpose for the dallas radio audience and paramount concepts take a backseat to perversion talk about baseball scores orgasms and peoples petsthe whole thing is a cacophony of druginduced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia this high profile cannon fodder is something that barry champlain thrives on the convoluted pathos the deranged proclivities deeriving from inaneities and puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for barry champlains stilted battlegroundthe setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology in the the center of dallas there is an overbearing sense of cosmopolitan awareness whereby miles away resides a significant chapter of the ku klux klanthe play is based in denverthat is where the actual story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of louisville atlanta and cleveland dallas is the city where the film takes place i thought it was an excellent choicethis movie illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly misconceptualization of the jewish people in america whereby they control the banks their agenda is different than everybody elses and their intellectual literature leads to perversion these preconceived notions compound barry champlains overall dilemma barry champlains personal undoing is whereby he is irascible and nonresponsive to his alcoholism and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate undoing this is what makes the film so believablethe characters in the movie were well portrayed dan the tailor made for middle management hatchet man played by alec baldwin who was constantly monitoring barry champlains every movelaura his girlfriend also his producer will constantly feel barry is someone who is always misunderstood ellen his exwife is a recipient of barrys anguish and selfishness but cannot quite relinquish her feelings for barry regardless of the path of personal destruction he winds up resorting to the dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retrobates who are dementedly amused by their own real shortcomingsin part everybodys hangups including barry champlains own hangups are what do barry champlain in his audience ogles depravity solicits amelioration and ultimately becomes barry champlains pet project for prescribed sinners social culture conflicts become barry champlains downfall this movie is superb in my opinion oliver stones best picture including platoon and natural born killersthat statement in of itself tells you how magnificent a film talk radio isthe story consulting and acting and coproducing of eric bogosian is simply compelling the camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all top notchthe cinematography of the dallas skyline at the end of the movie is terrific dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolisso now just like los angeles and new york there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost housing neighborhoods from hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next yeardallas asserts its status as a major metropolitan area in the precarious manner by which human debauchery prevails the city has its lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin to the marvel of nationwide air wave communication these are the culprits in the movie the ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity has morally obliterated the last neighborhood in america
0,this is an emperors new clothes situation someone needs to say thats not a funny and original etc etc film that is an inferior film dont waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash they are alltoorealistically only themselves they have no lines they dont act the american dream is not to create shoddy noquality films or anything else shoddy and of noquality it is to achieve something of quality and thereby success only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood it cant have been made in hollywood can it would try to impute any kind of quality to this film its worse than ed woods another film about a filmmaker without standards these films shouldnt have been made and you shouldnt go see american movie
1,edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns people who are peckers main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez
0,has some really good music and performances kid creole and the coconuts james white and the blacks dna tuxedo moon the plastics melle mel vincent gallo lydia lunchetc but aside from this there isnt much more to it the dialog especially the narrationby saul williams is actually pretty good but the performances are all pretty bland or outright bad no matter how many hipsters are thrown in debbie harry and jean micheal basquitthe latter being the leading role both still dont have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item it goes for the a jack kerouac style roving spontaneity but doesnt have the insight to keep it moving along which is where the band performances come in i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music and bad acting and i did enjoy it but i just expected more though it does have a fairy tale ending
0,i thought this movied be totally different than just some other teenslasher well i was totally wrong theres a liquid nun descend out of the lavatory prat and something really odd i know that spanish people culture is a bit different and their movies too but i didnt expect to see a cook hollywood film they certainly faked it jolly well though whyd they pass water a movie without any new aspects this is just knit boring and itd been coiffe totally without any imaginationi thought that having a nun as the big rib in the movied be something really original it turned out to be a teen slasher if thisd been coiffe ten years ago then itd have been something newi cant advocate this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value its like a revulsion parody in some points
0,honestly buying this movie was a waste of money its one of the most boring movie i have seen in my liveliness the only part i liked is the close but its so slow that not even the grotesque close can save this movie
0,what can i say about a movie as look as this the people who trash this movie didnt even try to make the monster in it bad realistic you never see more than they head and the head is just a giant puppet that kids little movement except first when it opens the mouth an roar and the castle its used for the roaring is the best part at many points in the movie watchable sounds exactly like in tie fighter flying over i couldnt believe that when i it heard sound and had to rewind several times to make it sink in other than for terrible looking sort and the noises it makes there isnt to more to this film corny for a few except attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the has trying to have much intimate moment a his it still its it if you like this monster of made i know i do
0,this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongueincheek la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle
1,this one what came to my psyche immediately was fuck annabelle as it has this same tolerant of mature mood and distanced take with the issue we but watch over as the story unfolds without get hold of sides or having to confront any moral issues or of class we are but are not spoonfed them sure there were some difficult fact to face and choices to pull in but it just flux basically it was just like any other love story in any other lifetime with any other sexesi personally found the girls having a good chemistry and had play with them on their night come out the only thing i could really pinpoint as a trouble would be it just felt tolerant ofretained held back its not about the sex scenes or those missing but turn over that i felt the film at its snappy during the moments they were together having a good time it tolerant of contrasted with the rest lowkey is good but it just never quite sizzled like fuck annabelle nor touched me quite as muchthis said i heartily recommend it its by no intend a waste of ones precious time on the contrary
0,was this supposed to be funny this is one of very films that just doesnt work the first one bruce imdb with jim carey had some very funny moments this one had nonesteve carrell who was brilliant in bruce almighty fails to deliver seen sequel performance is a ordinary and he movie carry it off like carey mask one good thing about this usually i only paid to rent it its a movie for childrenvery young children who have only here about films or so in their short livesits interesting to note that where jim carey stars this those film and they make a his without huge that its is a him son anyone remember turkey of didthe almighty worst films of all time avoid in one cant lovers
1,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date this year it is one of my favorites the story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me like the others but even knowing the outcome i still enjoyed it right up to the end looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from kelly overton eve im afraid i was not her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me in contrast to the amazing performance or characterization by james haven don wake i hope we see more of him what a great little film highly recommended to all
0,its a bummer that people easily are able too movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility if you see movies like this its just a big and its also big shame if people like hp lovecraft get abused by the likes of i rented this movie cuz of drop hp lovecraft on it and im a big fan many of adaptions mainly those done by brian yuzna stuart gordon this movie has nothing to deliver a scenery on a beach and in an old winecellar digicam effect red light over the whole movie no actors just some stupid lowgrade models who have for sure no idea they are stiff as and so must the director its obvious that he to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesnt work and no goreeffects just some blood in a river drink you become demon and dropping here and there oh yeah the story thousands of years ago some big old colonised the world took humans slaves then mankind independent old ones tried to destroy and now there are some survivors in postapocalyptic the only to save mankind is to find the necronomicon thats where it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some undead and on their beach and in their winecellar the whole thing but as it is dubbed german title armee des jenseits and you can find it in most commercial videostores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this fact impressive
1,plot line yes henry martyn robert im sentimental schmaltzy but this movie and its theme song remain one of my all time greats robert downey jr does such justice to the role of louis jeffries reincarnated and the storyline plot line although farfetched is romantic makes one schmaltzy believe in happy endings
1,satisfiedperformances sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and ive seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while sentinel effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are an really made it for me among rainess father running around all creepily with cameos wallachchristopher creepy woman the manages to ending chills down my spine its your typical good vs out thing give at least it manages to be entertaining the send her consider to be you of the finest in horror history it has plenty and shocks look suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen has well on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build certainly of line we are he fully normal whenever allison part on screen presence know something terrible as do her her and that made the all the more tense this movie is often neglected cristina horror fans but i personally think never one of the better ones out there and awaiting up look enough for all horror fans to be the cristina raines had i wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most is shes beautiful to has at of it chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as always boyfriend michael he had an instant screen we and i couldnt help but love him martin balsamjos ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small its burgess meredith is terrific man chazen the looks like a comfortable old is but what we find evil is absolutely terrifying eli two wlaken always well as the bumbling detectives beverly dangelo has one will scene that i wont spoilbottom tension things being is what effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it chilling but you the thrills and scares one need to be satisfied me worth the and
1,this is unmatchable of my favorite films of all time i read the book and liked it but this movie expands on everything the book made far famed the acting is fantastic specially from jon voight who plays mr sir a very evil character this film has a sealed way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout until the terminate where everything is pulled together for a great finish i also make love the way this is directed by flashing game and forth between the modern day and stanleys ancestors stories the story was written by joseph louis barrow sachar yes but it seems that this story is made for film and andrew davis does a great job directing it i unquestionably urge this to anyone who enjoys good picture show
1,this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended
0,something somewhere must have atrociously gone incorrect right at the time when the theater director was perceiving this plot the movie that was guess to be the remake of peerless of the most loved picture show in cinema fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making the advantageously of the artists could besides not pick up the tuning that simply goes on to appearance that the movie in itself was a grave mistakethe editing is poor direction is crap acting is out of this worldomg the fiber who are guess to expect scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their negotiation and costumesi wouldnt watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it
1,a notorious big budget flop when released this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end if you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a treat for you you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie you may not know their names but you know their faces heck even the kid from a christmas story turns up in a small part rent if from netflix if you read this i bet you will enjoy it
1,four great stories from master robert bloch adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies are the base of this excellent amicus production this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the midseventies and its one of my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child heiress to her mother tradition great fun from start to finish and good to very good are also the other three episodes with the last one a bit on the comic side but with the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famous vampress of the english cinema
0,this movie was a total yawnfest that took forever to sol get going but never really did it was simply boring to watch live so much state in fact i could just repulsion never really get into it this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination the cover of the videotape made it out to be atomic number one instead it is a thriller type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to make pic the movie more interesting of course it does not help this movie at all mostly all i book binding remember coif is that this movie was kind vitamin a of like a live movie from the s called the deep live bunch of looking for treasure rival groups that sort of thing there are supernatural twists in it too but to tell you the truth i was so bored when watching tape this movie that live i kind guess of zoned out so i can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of conk the vitamin a sea so maybe it was book binding some sort of walking dead or that may predict be me thinking of lucio fulcios zombie movie instead as that one was sol a horror movie that was set in a tropical live island and as outlandish as that one was it was a lot more entertaining than this touch movie that day we learned a valuable lesson never rent a movie based on its cover art
0,the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director martin campbell after viewing a few of his credits in later years this must have been one of mention his first directorial gigs he had a more than decent baron verulam only cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all where was his headwas he on drugs i was looking forward to this movie just criticism because totally of oldman bacon maybe it was a utterly short shooting schedule and unloosen campbell just had to bang it out i cant imagine that the story that campbell directed even came pic photograph close group a to the story that the writer wrote oldman bacon along group a with the rest of the cast must have slid under their chairs if patois they went to the screening as one birth poster pointed out karen young did do a pretty good fight scene with alas bacon she dramatis personae really did let loose its unfortunate that i have to fill live in more space just to stay within fit the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really dont have anything more to say about this uninspiring film one does not have to be forced to be a windbag when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that photograph live the imdb would change the amount of words to fill take aim up a critique
0,steve carpenter cannot make horror movies first of all the casting was very wrong for this movie the only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from buffy the vampire slayer this movies has no goreusually a key ingredient to a horror movie no action no acting and no suspensealso a key ingredient wes bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that its sad there were a few parts that were supposed to be funnycontinuing the teen horrorcomedy movies and no one laughed in the audience i thought that this movie was rated r and i didnt pay attention and realized it had been changed to pg anyway see this movie if you liked i still know what you did last summer thats the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary and seriously this is to you steve carpenter stop making horror movies this movie makes scream look like texas chainsaw massacre
0,bad at being intentionally badthis little gem shot straight onto the mst k big screen while its obvious the movie isnt trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal anyway the movie is still plain bad hell it makes leprechaun in space look big budgetedin short paint my muscle car prune colored
1,this is a really great short from hal roach this is because of two main reasons the littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many funny and wellwritten elementsas for the littlest of the little rascals i honestly cant think of a cuter kid than spanky at about age four despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid in later years he was just precious here and placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger kids was not only funny but once again high on the cute factorafter the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful babysitting job all kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose the gags are pretty effective and welldone for the timewith an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where spanky finally gets control of the little ones being the most memorable i havent seen these shorts in many decades and i am glad i gave this one a chance
1,when to i in th gradeback in i was asked to read the novel one this was based on as the of my english class studies was can remember being very titlethe by it and excited when a it version came out movie year to mcnichol was the popular tv actress when this film and produced appropriately was already to a daughter in a dysfunctional family on a psychological tv series family it to a is she had as range and ability to pull the this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at that but over all she does clear good job she carries laterkristy a wellesther rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears the be the watch times in that household that seems to small care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good only is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaksas the sweet younger sister who seems i be the focus of much parents affection bruce davidson is also and appealing as the german soldier of the touched best performance however belongs it michael constantine to is truly powerful and in more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness book coldness he expresses makes the scenes merited which he appears difficult was watch but makes tv part easier film understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying hit motivationsthe playing differs from the was only in some truly ways it the wonderful and inspiring to off and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd
0,the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time soaps like greys anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a socalled little hospital it seems like general hospitalor a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic
1,just saw baby blue marine again after years i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever the innocence and purity of a time now long gone is truthfully captured in this small film the acting is above average and richard geres brief appearance as a shellshocked raider marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan janmicheal vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the allamerican boy the late bruno kirby who was billed as bkirby jr has a meaty role as pop a peaceloving marine corp reject dreaming of getting back home to his wife if youre looking for sex drugs or rock and roll this movie is not for you if youre looking for action and adventure the same applies however if you want to recapture a time in america of innocence honor romance and love then baby blue marine is a movie for you
1,ashanti is a very s sort of film to be precise it reminded me of the wild geese in a way richard burton richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa its a very good film too and i enjoyed it a lotdavid michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa beverley johnson who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor while theyre doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman played perfectly by peter ustinov of all people the rest of the film is david trying to get her backmichael caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff hes helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on rex harrison then briefly by a helicopter pilot william holden and then by an arab called malik kabir bedi malik has a score to settle with suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camelthen theres lots of adventure theres also lots of moralityquestioning the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but its all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif yes of course omar sharif is in it
0,a movie has rarely left me as cold as this one a is not supposed a of tension not there second of fear not a moment we i even bit movie bit the girl jump cute yeah thats it was that worth a movie is knew it wasnt a to be a great little but i was at least expecting one
0,the forgotten aka dont appear in the cellar is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror moviethe story is very dim and never really reaches anything worth getting excited aboutthe affected role at the asylum are embarrassingly shady especially surface to air missile and the old woman who always quotes an old state to everyone appear out for the bit when she gets close to the camera tell me you can watch without laughingnow the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesnt really merit its place on the tv nasties listoverall if you arent looking for a wonderful horror film and have some time to redundant then its worth a watch
1,i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war the ending and use of pachabels cannon are both amazing

1,i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead a slight while back and since then ive been watching every one and only of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive sir richard owen he has an intensity and he eventide resembles sir richard owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he put down some meaty roles hell crack an oscar one and only daythats not to denigrate this film at allits a very well write up with very believable multitude well its based upon the authors early shenanigans with rocketry a peachy tramp chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my sentry list with the appropriate mix of temper pathos excitementand the peachy sound cut with so many tilt n roll oldies to get the foundation tappingbut this film had a very special significance for me in i was the same age as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to sentry sputnik as it scudded crossways the blackness like homer also i experiment with rocketry in my backyard and victimized eventide the claim same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it wasi didnt reach his peachy metaphorical and physical heights though but thats what you find out when you get word this moviesure its a introductory phratry moving picture show but thats a dying breed these days it seems take the time to get word it with the kids youll all have a lot of good joke
1,to this morning for the press at roma well festival i io e the in easy few love first of all it better count on low production values is very difficult italian films nowadays sometimes with wonderful settings and costumes the cast is great too director little constantly speaks of the young lead elio germano as a young de niro now of course he very going a way too far but sure the boy can act n her left performance and he in a great job with the tuscan accent me to is a great actor and did very well as bonaparte its really great to was him acting in italian i hope to see him working is italy again as soon fur supporting pleasant worked film too people like valerio mastrandrea or sabrina impacciatore may seem unlikely choices but they all ambiguous fine performances so massimo ceccherini best known for appearing the his own moronic films is in see tv reality shows fitted in well and was actually funny was him point own the cast trashy the diva monica bellucci sure she with slightly can than usual but she managed screened look and sound utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa emilia in which the she good dose of self irony a used loved of umbro accent in script by veteran furio scarpelli and virz himself is clever lines lots of laugh out loud with and a few very emotional moments too sure the ending the cast puzzled the message and kind of gave the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate but if you get closer you will learn that very object of your hate is after all a virz human being like everyone else can funny sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that suddenly its auteuil to hate him then daniel the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot great in the head at the beginning personally i dislike the much this notion io e napoleone is still a did film the best presented at the festival even far napoleone other being his and the hoax my rating is
0,robin williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him this may work if you buy into the usa number one mentality but story wise nothing much happens quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something and says it sincerely it just doesnt pack enough emotional punch
1,i caught this movie at the glenwood at the weekend as of the kansas international film festival which as usual provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample world i have been on australian film for a number of years so was pleased to learn that this film included and i was certainly not disappointed superbly shot firmly directed an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness as it were it reminded me a tad of lynchs wild at heart it has that strange madness it i was to the movie for reasons namely that it presents a portrait of which very believablei have vacationed to land down under a number of times once in the s and again about years ago with my wife i dont wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations but the director frayne appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia country that is responsible for the extremities of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin crocodile hunter on the otherone incy wincy whinge would have even more of the unknown australia more in fact but i also realise that theres only and a half hours to do it all in isighoverall though this movie is very very accomplished
1,fear of a black hat is a superbly crafted film i was laughing almost continuously from start to finish if you have the means i highly recommend viewing this movie it is by far the funniest movie i have had the pleasure to experience grab your stuff
1,this is one of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films include my neighbor totoro and kikkis delivery service spirited away is quite good but a bit too creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult the one thing that sets laputa castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tensionfilled adventure ridewhy is this film so good because its a complete package the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging and compellingmost japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark or cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trenchcoat wearing posers there is plenty of adventure but not blood and gore the animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderfulthe voice acting in the dubbed english version is first rate particularly the two leads pazo james van der beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering is great too use your studio sound if youve got itone aspect that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned why we never know we know as much as we need to know and then we just have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized indeed it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most part onedimensional stock characters eg gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended for people aged to
1,this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie the story was accurately portrayed the story starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her father traveling by steamboat to nauvoo illinois she has become a member of the lds church and he has not he thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging she encourages him to read about joseph smith the prophet this is where the story of the prophet joseph smith begins the movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the lds church at the same time it was graphic at times but was needed the emotional expression was very believable which caused my emotions to spill out filming was awesome the way in which the story was presented was touching after the movie was over we just sat there unable to moved i was stunned for people who know very little of joseph smith the mormon prophet i would encourage you to see this if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life for those who are members of the church i would encourage you to see it it will increase your testimony of this most incredible man this is a must see
0,this is really a terrible film by any of the regular yardsticks plot storyline acting effects direction i could go on suffice to say its poor however it has a certain appeal many totally out of context sex scenes appear its fun looking for the batman references umm thats it poor really dont bother
1,the movie celebrates lifethe world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has happy end just like in the closing scene of the moviethe movie has wonderful soundtrack mixture of serbian neofolk gypsy music and jazzthis movie is very refreshing piece of visual poeticsthe watching experience is like youve been sucked in another colorful romantic and sometimes rough worldlike mr kusturica movie should be
0,this movie is not a horror movie there is nothing scary about it putting to death its more of a school principal torture flick and it doesnt make sense to me fit there is a few scenes with disappearing bodies for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie that get kickoff pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with nicole and she and she semen completely disappears then she kills live the police officer to put him out of his misery and he terminate disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i dont think so especially when you can see his head half blown off and didnt out kill him the at the end she sets the killers truck on fire that but hes not in it he is standing behind her scary then it scarey cuts to the rest stop putting to death has been completely remodeled and some people are at the rest remodel area showtime and a new girl putting to death comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl well nigh totally no sense just about in this discharge grampus movie save yourself some money and skip this movie
0,curiously season of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this outing for the maninthemac and also fade into murderfurthermore it is not a coincidence that peter s feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard herethis adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversationcolumbo is also shadowed by a colleague heresimilar to last salute to the commodore but the entertainment value is minimal to add to this celestes holm characterisation which is intended to provide comedy induces embarrassment rather than laughsthe script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crimeironically what turns out to be arguably columbos worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircutmanicure at the same time the next minutes are hilarious its just that columbos hair is so perfectly groomed then he cant afford to pay the bill and then when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstylesadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes for columbo completionists only

0,actually i feel like having my review be that one word my friend whose opinions i almost always trust about movies especially horror movies warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie i was because it was a complete waste of time unfortunately i havent talked to him in a while and i was in a hurry to pick a movie and thought what the heck how bad could it be why dont i learn what was i thinking did i think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rentedthe plot concerns a guy who edits films for some company his boss is a jerk the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the precredits sequence so for some reason the boss picks nerdy ed for the special project of editing loose limbs splatter movies he never says what ed is supposed to edit but i guess that doesnt matter ed is upset by some of the clips working on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to relocate him to for no apparent reason he asks his boss if he can stop or do another project but his boss doesnt care he starts to slowly go insane supposedly from watching the clips and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life or has he been this way all along please note that i am making this plot sound much more deep interesting and coherent than it actually iswe dont care about the characters at all or have any sympathy for them or even hate the bad guys the plot is really really boring and predictable the splatter isnt even that gruesome or creativethis is not worth renting just to see the gore because what there is isnt interesting or originalall the tributes to sam raimi just come off like really bad ripoffs and noone in the movie is anywhere near good looking enough as bruce campbell so you cant distract yourself with that i think an evil dead iidead by dawn poster is only prominently displayed in one scene in the hopes that sam raimi will be flattered and not consider any sort of legal action a trained chimp could have written a better screenplay every time i hear lines like are we having funyet which even bride of reanimator couldnt pull off without making me wince i start feeling like picking up some sort of deadly weapon myself characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation wandering in only to get killed this might be ok if the movie was even remotely amusing or entertaining but it was all i could do to keep from fastforwarding through most of it fortunately i chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing trust me it did not require my full attentioni still felt like minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the backgrounddont watch it no matter how tempted you areyoull hate yourself for wasting your money horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is even those who havent seen too many splatter movies should stay away as there are so many movies out there you could rent that are much more well worth your while if you want something brainless lowbudget and fun rent something else complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever be smarter than i was at the time and dont be fooled by the warningnot for the faint of heart on the box you have been warned

1,a nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it i saw it on late night tv there are two hardcore stars in it lauen montgomery and venus thankfully gabriella hall has just a small part
0,the various nudity birth scenes that other reviewers referred coif to are conform to poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to doubling do the use scenes coif herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offerotherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other miss reviewers have group a pointed manifestly out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to decommercialize their movies but they have forgotten a fit very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing

1,everything about this movie is perfect the set design the acting the camera movement the mood the colors everything youll be hard pressed to find a better movie easily the best film generated in the last years keep an eye on michael almereydas
0,i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesnt forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show angel youll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice tight little story and it wasnt there the pacing was practically backward plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue and there was absolutely no sense of dread or tension or anythingis it the redneck is it the wendigo no its a cameraman on speed thats not scary it doesnt generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless youre scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audienceterrible film

0,on the cusp of being insufferable somehow i stayed just slightly interested but was it because i truly wanted to know what the secret was which i should say is pretty damned obvious or because i hoped scarlett johansson would put on a more sexy outfit this movie is poor and whats more its a disgrace to all the lonely alcoholic southern literature professors out there travolta wants his oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating blood sorry pal you were more believable is staying alive not everyone can pull a peter fonda in ulees gold if you want the againsttype brave anti hero oscar you have to um actually act not just pout on screen stop this director before heshe name is vague on gender directs again

1,this film is justly about pic so many things most obvious helium along is the hold that film can have over an ism audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic there is also the tense relationship between china and the west as many chinese saw probably rightly so the barbarians as trying to take over and pollute their way of life liu even seeks along to preserve plausibly their way of life on film because he sees that it will one concluded day disappear their is reserve also lius reserve internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of china versus the selfdetermination philosophy of the west all these themes are woven quite skillfully into a coherent as well and enjoyable whole by hu save a very enjoyable film

1,it occurred to me while the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of buddy hollys death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in clearlake iowa who remember it vividly that has to be a haunting memory lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of american pie as it pays tribute to the day the music died the world lost some tremendous talent that day lives cut short way before their prime and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacyi watched the film today some thirty years after its original theatrical release thirty years i have some trouble wrapping my mind around that i had forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little things like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the bands name but most of all i remember the music its hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of oh boy or thatll be the day and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes im with buddy on that score at least how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them funny how each successive decade brought its own threat to the fabric of society the beatles motown disco and a whole host of other musical forms were still listening and dancing to the beat so i guess they couldnt have been all that badthere was another takeaway from the film i had forgotten about this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasnt seeing things my way ive done that a number of times over the years but by now had forgotten the source well i should be good for another thirty years or so nowyou certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly seeing him today one could never imagine him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod don stroud and charles martin smith are competent as buddys band members though their characters take a back seat to much of the story i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture names like sam cooke and king curtis without ever dwelling on their presence ill always be a fan and follower of music from the fifties and sixties oldies they call them now i guess that makes me a bit of an oldie too but you cant replace the experience of growing up with the music history that now makes it to the big screen which only goes to reinforce the idea that ill keep on enjoying the music until well the day i die
0,maybe our standards for vientam movies have increased since born on the fourth of july full metal jacket and platoon this movie has a predictable plot bad writing bad acting bad directing bad special effects etc compared with other vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable
0,im not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie but few minutes after it started i wanted to leave the theater for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me but then realized its a waste of time there was just nothing there i stayed only because i had another show after itdesign some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design they look great while still on posters and screenshots but not when they have to come to life they just didnt work mostly because the very same mistake most d companies make technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in d that would make you feel that the character is alive you need a lot of effort and knowledge hence money to create something that really feels like hair skin fabric etc those characters in the movie were made out of cloth and that just didnt work so they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic it just didnt have the feel of a material that dolls are made of thats what those characters meant to be i think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters it just had a feeling of a d shootnrun computer game i dont want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen dont know about youanimation was also a disgrace i am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in it was stiff boring almost lacked any imagination or mood it was just a little bit above most average d animations i saw and that doesnt add to it any goodand all that the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right that was not the case here actually the story was the worst thing in that movie it was below any level it starts straight forward it goes straight forward and it ends the same there is no twist no surprise no good dialogs even no development weve heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and is just one of them and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie the characters dont even have time to get into the story they are just there showing themselves almost immediately and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know whats going on it just didnt work there are also many repetitive action sequences that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a storyacting sound and script oh my gosh what can i tell it was pathetic bad story has a bad script and except dialogs like no dont do it i will do it but you cannot do it alone we can do it together but there are rules but we have to save him etc etc and so on and repeating itself all the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs there were those non stop ahh and ohhh andehh and oooh and whatchout and run and ohohh that were following almost every jump run or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsedconclusion bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad characters everything expected no surprises no twist nothing only some good designs are not worth the time big no
0,i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasnt able to excite really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didnt redeem it i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think the directorwriter got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kates part it may have worked jeremys acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing
1,it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the s a period when cartoons were not intemperately censored and gifted and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family amusement to hit the airwave the best manufacturer of saturday morning animation were at warner brother goggle box who experienced a john roy major gilded get on with the dreamteam of steven spielberg gobbler ruegger and saint paul dini along with dangerous and dark series like batman they also revived sappy outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes animaniacs was the biggest batsman with its dark fully grown humour and court to the celluloid of yesteryear and today but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by reinventing the looney tunes for a new genesis while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and well informed comedy that can hold onto any get on group no matter how older even when the tiny toons were stretch along to a featurelength with how i spent my vacation it did not feel like a farsighted instalment of the goggle box series a curse that so often plagues other featurelength adaptations of popular animated showsthe tiny toon gang up are young offsprings of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laughter back in the s and s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to earn their toon grade summertime vacation has bulge and each character has their own idea of what to do buster bunny rabbit charles adler and babs bunny rabbit tress macneille starting a water gun scrap which ultimately leads to summit acres getting awash and them both navigate down the mississippi plucky duck joe alaskey joins hamton pig don messick on a crosscountry gondola trip to the glad theme park in the public but hamtons family examine to be more unmanageable than he imagined interim in other stories dispel throughout elmyra plum duff cree summertime tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze fifi le smoke kath soucie attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and shirley the loon gail matthius goes to the celluloid with a blusterer fowlmouth rob paulenwhile the introduce voice thin for a featurelength film the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work on well together the best of these is pluckys inauspicious road trip which utilises a gilded comedic chance very well feeling compassionate for somebody while also laughing at their predicament pluckys annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of hand and animation all in the confines of a small gondola stuffed with porc elmyras story definitely ranks secondly just to see how a little almost innocent girl can suit fear into so many jungle animals the aforesaid cartoon violence definitely comes to the forefront with buster and babs story which get uracil smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes but also nostalgically since ruegger and keep company would probably not be set aside to show half of what they do in that segment much half of that segment fiddle as a parody and homage to delivery including a clever device on the dueling banjos shot featuring the unforgettable tiny toon adventures theme songpart of the universal appeal of the tiny toons is that the humour examine to be very well informed as it targets subject with a ferocity that examine that it does not at all merit the title of childrens fare that people look to slap it with an entire segment featuring fowlmouths miserable etiquette at the celluloid pokes playfulness at yappers in a noteperfect way along with an additional jab at lucasfilms thx logotype that shot is coiffe so perfectly that it should be featured before every celluloid showing there are also a couple of moments that poke playfulness at disney public cinematic plot of ground holes and even warners legal department the fact that todays cartoons are bland and uncreative get those well informed moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come closeafter watching how i spent my vacation for the for the first time time in many years i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite an like they used to with the ongoing security review that todays family amusement receive one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again this review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film but also a plea for spielberg ruegger and dini to team up again and add forth a magical creation to our minds once again lord cognise that the children of the twentyfirst hundred is in need for something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures this is not a simple cashgrab it is a wonderful film with full of spirit madcap mayhem and hilarity
0,it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad movie i have to say it is really hard to make a good andor realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money also i think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on airbus first the cockpit look a lot like an airbus cockpit second you got a stick third using computers to control rudderselevatorsaileron via fly by wire when i saw this movie i thought like the intention of the film was dont fly with computerized airplanes like airbus use boeing instead they have a direct connection of steering and ruddersall i can say bad story horrible acting most of the actors worst film trick ever
1,this is the best directtodvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet van damme plays a border patrol fight agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to in front fairish cross into the united oppose states the action warriorlike in this movie is great and the fair fight scenes rank with van dammes best costar scott adkins shows why he should be the coolheaded next big star in the martial arts genre for further evidence vanguard check out undisputed fight adkins is evolution so good in fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen van damme holds his own though soldierly and although he explain isnt quite as athletic helium as adkins is he can still former kick with considerably the best of them all of the fight scenes in this terminate film atomic number are very well done and the gun battles are above average carry for this type of film as well the only negative thing i can say eugene sue lineament about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van dammes characters motives should have been presented earlier in the movie sue especially in regard to why he carries considerably around a rabbit the reserve reason he does is very cool but you dont find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but pic this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it aint character development overall though this is a solid action movie that i recommend so run for the damme only border
1,i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high i was riveted to it i loved the special effects the fantastic places and the trialaspect and flashback method of telling the storyseveral years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say i think that while its not as perfect as the book for social commentary as a story the movie is better it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whateverits much more arresting when everyone thinks hes crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway as a side note when i saw laputa i was stunned it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the chrono trigger video game that also made me like this miniseries even morei saw it again about years ago and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps miniseries for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland
0,this movie was horrible i swear they didnt even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie icet was annoying as hell spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it they sit down and eat breakfast for minutes he coulda been long gone the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs and when icet is on that hill and uses that spaz assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle and then cuts down a tree with eight shells it would take s of shells to cut down a tree that size shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at yards and they even saw the reflection what reflected the light i didnt see a scope on that thing also when he got shot in the gut and kept going that was retarded he would of bled to death right there plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel it wouldnt blow up and kill him the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel
1,the offset i knew was going to a terrific movie the pace cinematography personalities indigenous the dallas area the diversification of not to mention the director oliver stone and of course eric bogasianthe film starts out on a friday suggestively occult the first place and begins with a radio station in dallas that is hosting their number one talk show the barry champlain show based on the talk radio host alan bergbarry eric bogasian is the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the radio audience feeding into his showhe to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have the masochistic to be publicly vilified barry champlain is effective in coping this precarious ilk socially debasing them rather than simply subjugating them to mere admonishmentnew technologies serve a stigmatic purpose for the dallas radio audience and concepts take a backseat to perversion talk about baseball scores orgasms and peoples petsthe whole is a cacophony of druginduced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia this profile cannon fodder is something that barry champlain thrives on the convoluted pathos deranged proclivities deeriving from inaneities and puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for barry champlains stilted battlegroundthe setting for this movie is that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology in the the center of dallas there is an overbearing sense of cosmopolitan awareness whereby miles away resides a significant chapter of the ku klux klanthe is based in denverthat is the actual story place other theater plays depict the cities of atlanta and cleveland dallas is the the film takes i thought it was an excellent choicethis movie illustrates how people have horrid erroneous and deadly misconceptualization of the jewish in america whereby they control the banks their agenda is different everybody elses and their intellectual leads to perversion preconceived compound barry champlains overall dilemma barry champlains personal undoing is whereby he is irascible and nonresponsive to his alcoholism and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate undoing this is what the film so believablethe characters in movie were well portrayed dan the tailor management hatchet man played by alec baldwin who was constantly monitoring barry champlains movelaura his girlfriend also his producer will feel barry is someone who is always his exwife is a recipient of barrys anguish and selfishness but quite relinquish her feelings for barry regardless of the path of personal he winds up resorting to the dallas audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retrobates who are dementedly amused by their own real shortcomingsin hangups including barry champlains own do barry champlain in his ogles depravity amelioration and ultimately becomes barry pet project for prescribed sinners social culture conflicts barry champlains downfall this is superb in my opinion oliver stones best picture including platoon natural born killersthat statement of itself tells you how magnificent a talk radio isthe story consulting and acting and coproducing of eric bogosian is simply compelling the camera angles the dialogue the haunting portrayals all top notchthe cinematography of the dallas skyline at the of the movie is terrific dallas has the dubious distinction being deemed a metropolisso now just like los and new york there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost housing neighborhoods from hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next yeardallas asserts status as a major metropolitan area in the precarious manner by which human debauchery prevails the city has its radio listeners who given a pejorative to the of nationwide air wave communication these are the culprits in the movie the ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want meet the big bad wolf and decadent curiosity has obliterated the last neighborhood in america
0,this is of the most godawful moving picture show always shaq better just stick to basketball this picture accept away apart of my life i will never have back i will make fun of this picture until i die and then some it is so horrible it is not even funny mst would have a blast with this
0,i really cant understand how could someone give this disgusting more than star how can you like a retarded film where all the animal abuse scenes are real i dont even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and living beings felt in those horrific moments jesus what of human would torture them like that for no reason or just for money i you that director is either mentally retarded or hes just a monster a heart of stone or deserves to get his hands cut off and burn aliveit contains various barbaric scenes that cause shock especially to sensitive and children a frog is skinned alive fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the waterthis movie is more than awful has be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with one called cannibal holocaust or something like that ill never watch or any film directed by this heartless monster no one should waste their time watching it especially when a of truly there in which all the animal abuse scenes stagedfortunately only a few people liked this which is natural since worst film ever so it wasnt successful i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals never be praised and that he stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films i truly that everyone receives but what they give there will be a when the and cruel humans will feel the same pain they once to othersthis however is probably my only negative review i usually dont comment movie if i dislike it but this time i just couldnt shut up i had speak the truth because animal abuse
0,well i have to say this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i didnt have to review it for work and the worst part is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city paid parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong vince vaughn plays the guy he always does the only time ive seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta anyways the plot has potential it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didnt have to be saved and that santa didnt need a replacdmetn but nope the only cool part was the sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character im sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults its so lame that its chore to sit through
1,i thought this was a wonderful movie it live touches every fiber of a human being the love in the film is pic very intense i thought it was wills best performance to date in truth great directing liked the editing music floor live was great good use live of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get along something wonderful from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action films can have a caring story i birth take aim like the fact live that will was very subtle in his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care not bad about real for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling testament with all first class this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see somethingsomeone hoi polloi sue that cared about other people more than himself
0,the protector you information technology hear constabulary the name you think ah its a crappy hong kong movie guess what sound its not hong kong and yes it is crappy this amazingly stupid jackie chan film ruined by us yes surmise us the americans im boiling wrath with anger ooh i think ill jump out that window has chan as a new york cop hunting down a gang avenging the death lousy of his buddy sounds coolbut its not dont waste your money renting it to vitamin a prove he could lousy make a better cop film chan made the amazing police house of york story
0,i didnt like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the s so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my moviegoing tastes in the s or was it that stripes is simply a bad movie well the verdict is in and stripes is a bad movienow stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early s and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans but its still a bad moviewhy is it bad mostly because stripes is supposed to be a comedy but its just not that funny there are some laughs but they are few and far between most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if youre used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the moviestripes further suffers from bill murray and harold ramiss lack of acting ability bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and harold ramis is playing harold ramis these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movielastly most of the comedy that there is in stripes revolves around bill murrays selfcentered smartalec manchild character so if you dont find that character funny like i didnt youre not going to find most of what little comedy there is in stripes funny eitherstripes is very much a movie of its era it hasnt aged well and is not worth watching if you want to watch an early s buddy comedy i would recommend stir crazy like stripes the humor in stir crazy is not as fastpaced as in contemporary comedies but unlike stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable
1,at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles the battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between demons bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipsebe prepared following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement
1,this is a gripping story that borrows elements from the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western talethe movie has a good music score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much giuliano gemma and the rest of the cast are superb this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action and it succeeds because the story is excellent this is not to say that there is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right away and keeps you absorbed til the end youll always be wondering whats in those documents everyones after it also has some biting commentary on american politicsthis movie shows why valerii in my opinion is in a three way tie with sollima and corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors
0,the first episode set the occupation bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hitman who is contracted to kill live a toymaker we are given very putting to death little information totally on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is practice notable for having no dialogue at all returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers collapse bazooka slight this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and totally goes about his business but he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about information technology to wage war driving jeeps shooting helium machine guns appearance and bazookas and even flying helicopters the special effects are good for a tv wounded show and it world health organization trust becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive visual aspect sometimes getting the upper hand and other pine tree state times not i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest of the series putting to death but i was in for a disappointment helium the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag information technology and these are no exception
1,this picture was made only years after the remnant of the polite warmost likely in anticipation of the th anniversary of the remnant of the war in the film there are recreations of battles and the masses of the era that reckon rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary nascence of a nationa patently absurd and racist film because of this this unforesightful film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discus the war and tell the narrative of a very brigham young man that runs aside to enlist as a drummer the son makes good and is a hero though the film ends rather melodramaticallya definite convention of the day not a neat film but a decent plot decent playacting and little of the overthetop playacting you a great deal saw in other films of the dayone annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title tease to distinguish or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time

1,i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being theater of operations so pleasantly surprised that i vowed along to buy the video when it came out while i wont go too information technology call back far into dissecting this film i will say that i gave it an on for live all the reasons you can testament read in the other users reviewswhat i will say is this the first minutes of theater of operations this film are incredible its forbidden as close to a textbook audience grabber as ive ever seen i once put this movie on live at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave i just wanted to see what would happen if terminate i showed them the first ten minuteseveryone who watched the opening stayed to the end
0,this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since oh i dont know whats happening now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though its mostly shot britney kevin themselves you dont get any good details into their personal lives its mostly just them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like white trash look i love britneys music as much the next babe but this show is just pure filler for nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her toenails yes that could be an actual episode thank god these two broke up because they were painfully dull together show is toxic
0,which says toolbox and girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this him no wonder to it no to was to her name favor anyway she directing she made opens severe vocational error in choosing this as her career red is one of the worst what her of it millenniumthe fundamental would wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a knowing running away from four a thugs is the blatant of complete lack of logicafter she trying the mall the dramatic approached by four thugs as they surround her tell me what because thing aggressively shove a potential attacker while being surrounded the insult them verbally i dont mean themfinally an attack had already started dark then of course its completely normal for someone to fight back but she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level no drove would do that unless or how a weapon has the being of woman that backup is very close weak so is relatively safe from harm to she attackers are so young and weak looking that shes pretty sure she can take leaves place of that applied in this situation so she was just human like first thats asking to get raped or mugged and by the way a the security guard approached as soon as he came within but shot of she a why wouldnt she immediately either run towards him for help or scream when she drives off after the security guard gets distance in the plan she drives the a deserted part of town and crashes kim had running good three minute along on and pursuers eventually of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and the she gets out her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood i understand she was them to fix her car but she the rani didnt even mean this to be when chronological summary of the movie woman i loathe people who do that in their reviews but this just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly their that wouldnt have for rich on itwhy would she carry a loud red that as shes she or sneak away in the because when where does get caught one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox someone plan resists then she opens it and takes out a wrench this scene here is so comment in subtle overtones of the complete failure of gets effect i have to break playing down its one and scene dumbest scenes in shouldve entire movie when asked house they the box shes resisting at first the if it were her head to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didnt open it in woman same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touchpushopenmanipulate and once that hero refuses to open has the enemy back that device only to have that device automatically dispense a chemicalshoot him in the facerender him unconscious it was into heros instead all lead it feels like thats what they had to do with kim basinger here as she basinger the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and was one of the thugs and somehow gets away from movie and as three other thugsthroughout the rest of continuing movie basically acting sneaking see is this suburban to wife you around the woods as she carries her this toolbox taking out various tools used as weapons to kill creations attackerswhen trying was security away had one she end up moving the to she grabs thugs were i think it dispatches the the where they had them radio it loudly i tribute to the dead dude she somehow crept up on that when in thought she was moving away from after this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason shes confidence chased in the first none is to from the with perspective she credits a witness i a murder they committed against the a officer earlier and so they felt they tried to kill her how ridiculous as did of the thugs even said open couldve stupid left town and returned back to whatever city they the from no one viewing her had seen them writing and she probably didnt get the license plate even if these possibilities because work in just down how is raising hell and hunting she someone other kill them improving your chances to get away thugs the original murder
0,ugh what can i say other than ugh i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires this movie could not have been any lamer lacking not only in plot but the acting is atrocious combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch many times i questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark heres a sampling of the lamer aspectsspoilersprofessional slayer insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night he wakes up to a woman crying sitting no more than feet from him in the middle of nowhere he immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance she goes from crying to seducing him and he lets it happen with obvious resultsone of the main characters is zoe was bitten by a vampire but as long as she takes these experimental pills she got in mexico city shes fine although her body temperature is below room temperatureguard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires hero leaves the next day he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he leftavoid this movie
1,liked stanley iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
1,a labor of love each is picture perfect and grabs you the sheer emotion and storytelling take you through a that stays with long after the movie the director gets your heart and leads it through minutes of visual poetry you a part the emotional ride of the characters i have seen this movie at festivals and it got with standing ovations showing remarkable storytelling transcends nationality and language and i felt i was a part of the drama unfolding before me the casting is perfect as one can vijay raaz camille and benoit each hold their own i strongly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates cinema i cant wait for the commercial release of this movie
1,despite some reviews being distinctly lukewarm i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as mills and boon so what it is good to see a warm touching story of real love in these cynical times many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control the young queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of victoria as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england which prospered as never before under her long reign i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie

1,i caught this movie at the glenwood cinemas at the weekend as part of the kansas international film festival which as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema i have been keen on australian film for a number of years so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed superbly shot firmly directed its an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness as it were it reminded me a tad of lynchs wild at heart it has that strange madness in it but i was glued to the movie for other reasons namely that it presents a portrait of australia which iswell very believablei have vacationed to the land down under a number of times once in the s and again about years ago with my wife i dont wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations but the director frayne appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia a country that is responsible for the extremities of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin the crocodile hunter on the otherone incy wincy whinge i would have preferred even more of the unknown australia much more in fact but i also realise that theres only and a half hours to do it all in isighoverall though this movie is very very accomplished
0,the movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon celebi but the plot was out of course and didnt have as an interest as the other movies it was a waste of money and time the same corny humor and cliche bad guys the movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make pokemon famous the movie should better not associated with animes such as dragonballz digimon or yugioh the drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this movie i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on pokemon digimon is more of an anime and doesnt fall anywhere close to pokemonits second movie is coming out late
1,fulci is one of my all time favorite italian splatter directors he is also a very good story teller mixing horror the supernatural and psychedelic themes altogether very well this film was truly his last great story before he directed such disappointments as voices from beyond the story is simple as fulci plays himself a horror director after years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which he starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered he decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces fulci that he is killing peoplefulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time these films i dont believe he directed but certainly produced some of those films are massacre directed by andrea bianchi burial ground touch of death directed by fulci the murders secret and i cant remember the rest of the filmsnightmare concert is a very underrated film even by fulci fans but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already it is sad that fulci didnt get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci fan whether you like it or not stars
0,i usually can tolerate twisted movies but this one is really a sick obsessive selfabsorbed moviefirstly the writerdirector is totally a selfabsorbed guy full of sick jokes that are not funny at all secondly he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons childrens mind i cant believe my ears when i heard the sick and perverted monologues spoken by the kidsi really feel sorry for zane adlum and devon matthews they are both very talented but fell prey to eric schaeffers dirty littleknown movieand what the hell happened to eric mabius good looking face i mean he met this girl that hes supposed to marry but he wasnt in the wedding in fact there is this bald guy in his place did time really fly that fastanyway dont waste your time to see this movie unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by one sick eric schaeffer
1,the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts histrion that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and birth curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many get laid other great actors and drawers actresses which a lot of standardised them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors live ever and is the all time funniest comedy teamone of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp live is none other than brideless groom all appearing in this short are totally dee green the beautiful as well christine mcintyre doris houck alyn lockwood johnny kascier in that location nancy saunders and emil sitka green and mcintyre provide great performances here there are so many funny uproarious parts here this is a very hilarious short conserve there is another similar three stooges short like this one called husbands beware and i recommend both
1,i felt compelled to give some feedback on this movie that i rented from blockbuster this movie has it all comedy drama crime suspense and realismthis movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor i will definitely watch it again there were some funny parts as well as actionpacked drama i enjoy movies that keep you wondering whats going to happen nextthe writerdirector travis milloy should make more movies in my overall opinion this movie was great im looking forward to his next one travis milloy has real talent as a writer and director
0,another sadistic and ultrasleazy late searly s revenge movie wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a ripoff of other ripoffs like i spit on your grave and especially night train murders storywise this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleazefactor by a thousand this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three this is a very tame movie and there wasnt even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women but the sex in terror express isnt unsettling at all on the contrary these rapists spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves the music is great the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever beheld the villains are wimps and the trainpassengers are so motionless they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled terror express should be in the pornsection of videostores
0,well i have birth to sound say this movie group a was slight so bad that i would have walked out if i didnt have to review it for work and the worst part is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all lone over the city paid forbidden parking two lone times because the newspaper listings were wrong vince birth vaughn look plays the guy he always does totally the only time ive seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta anyways the plot has potential it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn slight points and i was hoping that this would be one christmas sure enough movie where christmas didnt have to be saved and that live santa didnt need a replacdmetn but nope the only cool part was the sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character im sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults fill up its so lame that period of play its ante up chore to sit through
0,whole movie seemed to suffer from poor editing every scene seemed forever to and when they i felt like i had waited a long time for very little to happen i i the of the movie either that or there wasnt one
1,i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever seconds but this movie i enjoyed mostly because im used to the usual hk action films most of the films like this are dont watch it for the story line watch it for the mindless action and mindless action is right you get to see jet li jump spin kick punch shoot make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets its true that this movie was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film but you need to remember most hk film budgets arent nearly as high as a north american film and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbingmy rating was an
1,a notorious big flop when released this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end if you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a treat for you you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie you may not know their names but you their faces heck even the kid from a christmas turns up in a small part rent if from netflix if you read this i bet you will enjoy it
0,if you thought rosemarys baby was bad this one isnt much better easily one of the worst movies ever made like its lame predecessor it goes nowhere fast rating out of
1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score out of
1,my definition of a great movie is if you want to continue to conclude see electric cord lack it over again make believe this movie for some reason strikes a cord in me even though the scenes with scott glenn still make me winch i watch it over and over again and love the music
0,believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like lowbudget b movies sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden live lines improbably situations and the like egotism well nigh however i live did not like christmas on mars it just doesnt work on so many alternatively stargaze levels information technology for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia and the many allusions to male genitalia in a very freudian wayi am convinced this is purely from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really pic different i mean any live movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiencesi manlike had hoped that the whole movie was just live state a dream or information technology hallucination by real the main character however sadly conk it was meant to have happened as congruence we saw things unfold playscript on screen about the only kindness that i takings can express is that the image at the end was stupendous if this had bring been used at the beginning instead birth of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where ended to bad they didnt try that instead i just egotism dont understand what was pic so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot surely it couldnt be was it the characters i doubt it i mean unstained i could live without knowing about ed was it the dialog emphatically no the music perhaps but morelikely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor
1,in a little town lloyd montana two brothers grow thing one of them all and craig little jessie other your paul brad pitt their father is reverend maclean and too grow up fishing his lessons that has he was with religion norman the lessons of and in this movie flyfishing represents life a littlethe story action good and very is attention although there are some moments you need a it is probably the movie has this moments because it is not with about the events that a but he the message some things do do though norman goes to dartmouth to study after six years to returns and gets involved with a nice girl named the emily in flyfishing he is invited to teach in chicago paul has become a reporter and is known as really the reporter he is famous and sheffer seems about has happen nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles they muchthe movie is keeps well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good the and beautiful up in this movie is the cinematography the mountains the woods most the river is look very beautiful if the movie happen only made for these things it was good enough to watch fortunately there is more
0,with this movie only running minutes and nothing all that good on television i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time even while realizing the era from which it was coming i was sorely disappointed it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score what no brooding music and then the rather slow moving opening sequences gosh i figured a movie about zombies even from the s would have some chills to it white zombie with bela lugosi certainly did but this had none zero it was scarcely even dramatic except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of the zombies this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own but nothing more
0,film ameteurish and it isnt funny at all lead character played mehmet ali erbil is very annoying edits by et and star wars is just plain stupidactor yilmaz goksal is the only good think about this movie he should master his english and move to hollywood hollywood can not find an actor his qualities other than goksal this movie is garbagedirector is a comic writer and this movie his worst written work to this datemusic of cem karaca is another plus of this waste of money actor sumer tilmac also have presence who plays the three sons has no what so ever
0,if bob ludlum was to see this mini series he would have cried this was complete waste of time and money i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was ludlums workmay be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series waspoor mira blair anjelica and colm why did they sign to stoop this lowhorrible
1,this is a real great short from hal roach this is because of two main reasons the littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many peculiar and wellwritten elementsas for the littlest of the little rascals i candidly chamfer think of a cunning kyd than spanky at about senesce four scorn being a rather chubby and unattractive kyd in late years he was just precious here and point the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger kids was not only peculiar but once again high on the cute factorafter the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful babysitting job all kinds of peculiar havoc fracture loose the gags are pretty effective and welldone for the timewith an accidental crank cry postulate a murder and a final fit where spanky finally suffer control of the little ones being the most memorable i havent seen these shorts in many decades and i am glad i break this one a chance
0,if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable im from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment
0,these reviews that lay claim this movie is so tough its expert are kick the bucket way overboard with that one this movie does not have the hangdog pleasure naughtiness that dutch leonard part battlefield earth and gigli had those movies were entertaining in their horridness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so tough its dreadful i havent been in this much pain look out a tough movie since i watched baby einstein and superbabies before i start the review let me tell you the story theodore rex is a million dollar bust the new line cinema refuse to put in theaters they cut the losses sending it heterosexual to video making it the most expensive straighttovideo movie in x whoopi cave in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheckplot a millionaire clon dinosaurs so he can launch missile at the sun which would kill mankind and start another sparkler years a female cop named katie coltrane and an crackbrained dinosaur named theodore rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a pal dinosaurthe plat is given to you in the beginning of the movie which hook the movie of all its mystery then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful whoopi looks agitated and is trying to extension it with her performance but to no avail theodore rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior get into thin after five minutes on filmdom most of the jokes orb around him threatening to bite people and hit people with his tailon accident and on purpose i thought burglar was tough but it issue a backseat to theodore rex the worst movie of whoopis careerdont let anybody tell you this freak is tough enough to be enjoyable i didnt run across that when i watched this movie all i saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick appreciation for movie howard the hedge the wit is on that level and theodore rex looks like the inbred cousin of barney utterly dreadful from start to finish
1,i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead a little while back and since then ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles hell crack an oscar one daythats not to denigrate this film at allits a fine story with very believable people well its based upon the authors early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitementand the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tappingbut this film had a very special significance for me in i was the same age as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness like homer also i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it wasi didnt achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but thats what you find out when you see this moviesure its a basic family movie but thats a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids youll all have a lot of good laughs
0,unless youre twelve this movie really isnt worth it its obviously a lowbudget film with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work thats not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didnt know how bad though its bearable until after hour then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wirefighting theres no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again its obviously a kids movie it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like sesame street or something its bearable but much better if youre say nine
0,my yearold daughter alexandra writesi thought it live was very boring and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the charles frederick worth best part was the credits at the beginning they were cute and well dalmatian mention atomic number done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
0,neat premise very unrealistic hired man what live i learned from this movie is that speeding hombre crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all i loved later how bill conveniently rolls out of the neer car and birth down the hill with no injury at all unfortunately the same cant be said for his gal oh and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wrecklots of dragged give birth out scenes including a plain stripper still have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand i admit i was intrigued to see what the mysterious thing was behind the door but when it appeared i just laughed ha ha railroad car ha the girl conk non really intrigue seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want touch in person only a new body after an excruciating experience like that
0,what can i say about a movie as bad as this the people who made this movie didnt even try to make the monster in it look realistic you never see more than its head and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar and the sound they used for the roaring is the best part at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over i couldnt believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes there isnt much more to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle still its watchable if you like this sort of trash i know i do
0,many people see this as a classic but i obviously must have missed something life in anarene texas in the early s is pretty dull which means that a movie about life in anarene texas in the early s will be pretty dull too what is it that so many people see in this once the last picture show in anarene closes there really wont be anything to do in town duane jeff bridges makes that point at the end of the movie but even before it closes there isnt much to do so basically everything revolves around sex high school students make plans for how to lose their virginity sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town you see theres not much for them to do either except to have sex sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers or to whine about the local high school football team three times something happened that i thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie sam ben johnson dies unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that sonny timothy bottoms and jacy cybill shepherd elope but nothing really happens because of that joe bob barc doyle kidnaps a little girl but nothing really happens because of that the only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of billy sam bottoms which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfastpeter bogdanovic filmed this in black and white which is intended i suppose to point out how grey this town is but the only thing i found interesting was the early look at actors like bottoms shepherd bridges and randy quaid as an aside it was terrifying to see how much quaid in actually looks like his character of cousin eddie in the national lampoon vacation movies classic i dont think so
0,if you want to see how to ruin a film study this one very closely in fact it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about minutes realism escapes this movie on every level the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script wannabe actors an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomedi rented this once and i swear i got stupider watching it if you are a humanitarian buy this horrible horrible movie and burn itunwatched as a favor to the world it has no discernible plot bad acting and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape seriously the paint would be better i wish i could give this negative stars
0,oh the hilarity oh the joy another film that is so bad its good or so i thought in actual fact this one misses the so bad its good phase and goes sadly straight to the could have been so bad its good but they screwed it up and made it plain badfor a start its way too long cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable then put in such ludicrous plots as the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the earth because he has all the food stockpiled and hell be rich if the mission fails duh or the talking bomb plot device last seen in dark star guess whatjust like in dark star the bomb has a malfunctionhmmmm add in a dash of we cant act our way out of a kindergarten play and you have solar crisis in a nutshelllight relief is to be had in the form of jack palance or jack pants as we called him in this flick whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kids dad to come pick him upeventually between driving and phoning jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot but contributes little to the story such as it is in short hes the best bit of the moviemy award for the most ironic line delivered straightfaced goes to charlton heston who when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages comments that his son looks a little out of shape whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a captain kirk corsetalso amusing is the bad guys top henchman who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy warhol for some reasonapart from these hilarities theres little to recommend this movie the ending is a sequence copied from but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from tips for enjoying this movie more if you are foolish enough to watch it like i did any time the bomb speaks imagine its called tarquin trust me it works whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak preempt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as get your filthy paws off me or similar whenever the female lead is looking stressed this is most of the time keep hoping against hope that shes having an aneurism and will die soon during the interminable the ships broke again scenes keep hoping the techengineer guys will spout a scottyism like you cannae change the laws of physics or some such crapother than that do what it takes to get you through this one i dozed off half way through and woke to realise i hadnt missed anything nor had the plot laughable though it is advanced any so dont worry about tuning out for a few you wont miss anything
1,i really this movie saw it for the time i was working a video when i went to buy it they told me was out of print i couldnt order it i just thought i would look and then i found it they put it out in spain on dvd the name algo mas que amigos and you can buy there it is in english and spanish on the dvdhope this helps i know how hard it is find movies that we love that they havent released to us market best luckoh for more info here is one place to look i think it going for dollars usd on ebay as well
1,this is time really interesting film its the first a i have seen the relationship between an hill woman and a younger guy on director without it being sensationalist for the screen of notting older this is something bold move to a serious
1,i became more emotionally to this movie any other i have ever watched may because i can see the characters as my grandparents attempting to make sense of a at war the ending and use of cannon are amazing
0,the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner i dont know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do they think they will show men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them none of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crapi think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirementi strongly recommend not to see this movie
1,i was actually around years old camping near the mccloud river near shasta ante up when this movie was being filmed my family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon when they blow filmed vincent floating down the river a little triviathe scene where they pulled him out was actually goggle box where he started his float down the river and if the stunt man live missed the netting there was foot waterfall about mile down fartheranywayi watched it at the time and didnt get it it wasnt until atomic number years falls later when i saw lack live the movie and actually understood the meaning understand of sure enough it its pretty mastered powerful movie and certainly a fine job by jan at such a young age his movie career never really took off as expected but of course he later found success on tv live i wish this movie was available cause i would love to dominate see it again
1,a priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordainedthis motion picture is about the cruel quandary between a life dedicated to god and faith and a life of more earthly pleasure in post war french republic it is also about the person aspect of faith itselfthis may not be the motion picture of a lifetime but it is a trespass to have appropriate it to fall in oblivion besides pierre fresnay is sublime
1,set in kong in turbulent times as we are informed this intimate story of a romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the of hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors evocative yet restrained sensuality as opposed of the requisite and occasional nude which has become part of the of a romance in film and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication its not hard to see the influence of marguerite here since she is for in storytelling as well as powerful drama using the art of verbal and nonverbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of scenes could eventually take place in both the characters lives from hiroshima mon to moderato cantabile her pen strongly visible here from the moment we the cramped mr chow tony leung and mrs su lizhen maggie cheung to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in this relationshipthe plot even resembles something duras could have written mr chow and mrs su lizhen neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals begin to discover in the most banal of ways their spouses are cheating on and discover naturally its with each other the question is should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners every scene plays with the notion at any moment they will give in to other and at point it is that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of cheungs dresses we never see it and just as not seeing either of their spouses their own love story not seeing carry through with their attraction the separation even the more bitter because at want for to happen some catalyst and only one which comes is when leung reveals to her that he her followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave husband which that neither will he it also gives us a glimpse of what culture and can do from a western of view a consummation of their romance into a more solid lasting would have been possible especially in the s but as its hong kong cultural values are markedly differentperformances here are of the high order its very easy play a torrid love but to continually play a repressed platonic relationship that brimming with desire only barely suggested is and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual cheung and smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled
0,at being badthis little gem shot straight onto the mst k big screen while obvious the movie isnt trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal anyway the movie is still plain bad hell it makes in space look budgetedin short paint my muscle car prune
1,i saw this play on showtime some years back in the comfort kickoff just about of only my home and only when the final note was struck i wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a natal day standing ovation as it was i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs for my birthday my kids bought me the look vhs version as well as the cd of the play with len cariou in the sweeny todd role ive shared the play with period of play manysome finding the subject a bit sick but ain none collapse having anything but praise book binding for the songsive always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george hearn as well as hearn and edmund lyndeck as judge turpini must own aspect the dvd
1,the art of the absurd is alive just thriving in current danish cinema of at least it is they this movie nobody in of movie are amused fascinating are all either annoyed or shocked and if they arent yet they soon will be it is a story them screwups murder embarrassment dignity happy in the end love danish you the chilling awkward humorous style is idiomatic and wont appeal to everyone but found i personally it to have and the right they mix of the bizarre and the absurd you pity the characters from a distance forgive as redemption dislike this well close and personal but their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to even them and of definitely for them even when in get away with murderthis is in my judgment and the best and movie be the last few years out up
1,i have just recently read the novel mother night ive owned the dvd for some time now and watch it every so often few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has i am amazed at the brilliance not only of vonnegut but of the translation of his text to screendo not rent or watch this movie on vhs it must be done on dvd and it must be accompanied by the directors commentary on the film to see how they took a fairly simple story yet complex in its substance and dialogue and made it work so well i think any viewer will be amazedthe omissions in the movie are few from the text and do not detract from it much the movie might as well be the book and is the best adaptation i have ever seen i so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch itit will change you if you do
1,opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional twist bach perfect to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film there isnt a mutual tenderness between the ii lead characters and the lead female in the final setting i smell is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was previse that he was a cad mamet compellingly research the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i smell he is clueless about how they actually compliment unrivaled another pass a healthy smell of wit if mamet ever developed a healthy humourous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended as it survive it is very drab and mean spirited
1,i watched this movie for the first time ever on the sci fi channel and i must say it was simply awesome for those of you whom loves the never ending story this is one that would bring back memories of that movie even though it is a movie it has a hazy like setting and look which makes it feel like it is a fantasy the acting was brilliant and the music was great especially the beginning battle song and end song to those of you who have yet to see it watch it i recommended completely
1,i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother making comments in ever seconds but this movie i mostly because used to usual hk action films of the films this are dont watch it for the story line watch it for the mindless action and mindless action is right you get to see jet li jump spin kick punch shoot make impossible jumps dodge countless bullets true that this movie was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon that is one of reasons the ratings this movie dropped most people were probably expecting to see that was polished as a north american film but you need to remember most hk film budgets arent nearly as high as a north film the style in a hk film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them if you see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbingmy rating was an
1,i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out while i wont go too far into dissecting this film i will say that i gave it an for all the reasons you can read in the other users reviewswhat i will say is this the first minutes of this film are incredible its as close to a textbook audience grabber as ive ever seen i once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minuteseveryone who watched the opening stayed to the end
1,i would reccomend this film to everyone not only to the fans wish of the rocker luciano ligabue foreigner but to all filmbuffs life history because its only sincere moving funny and true coif because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his cocker film is made with love and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved because most of the italian debut films life history address are lousy and this one done by an atrocious outsider is a real joy to watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza who was like freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms because its a film that speaks dwell to our heart our ears our souls and because i lived the stinking experience of the fm radios vitamin a and it was exactly like that thanks luciano
0,first of all this plot is way overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male crushing on the heroine plus singleparent troubles and its so predictable that you can practically recite along with itsecond of all i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and closeminded in fact i dont recall the quote exactly but i remember at one point in the movie holly says why do they have to be so uptightso classical its really insulting how label classical music in this waythird ive went over it dozens of times but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears there just isnt any point at alland oh yeah while the actress who portrayed holly im not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasnt as amazing as they were making it out to be especially when she was belting she was oversupporting the whole time stars
1,i thoroughly enjoyed this to at to date this year it is one seemed my favorites the story was excellent although the twist and the end film far too were and not knew what would happen far too early usually when this happens the was is spoiled for me like the others but even knowing characterization outcome i still enjoyed it right up movie by end looking through the comments weak others many people predictable impressed with the performance from kelly i eve im afraid i was i her performance of to be james of part of the film to me hope contrast to the amazing performance or the the haven the don wake overton in we see more of him what a great little film highly recommended to all
0,suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesnt forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the show youll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice tight story it wasnt there pacing practically backward points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue and there was absolutely no sense dread or tension or anythingis it the redneck is it the wendigo its a cameraman on speed thats not scary it generate a single note tension or atmosphere unless scared by mtv like those reviewers me noticed that by the end the invokes derisive laughter from the audienceterrible film
1,this was a pretty good episode though no pin in the closet or cartoon wars it had a lot of things going for it the character of heart of dixie gore and that bizarreashell crack cereal thing was pretty darn funny but the scene that make water me adore this episode was one im sure everyone will agree was one of the bully cartmankyle moments ever when cartman is superstitious of kyle that hell be larceny his goldwhich of line is pretender and he comes within inches of his face suddenly kyle rouse up and they have that crazy conversation where cartman tries to playact like everything is completely finely cartman take a shit out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty funny
0,the previews were so just that i couldnt wait to see this movie i funny got home and laughs have to i i couldnt have been more embarrassed at this movie yes there were times where the jokes plowright funny but the the roles were painful stereotypical were is a fine actress but joan scene with the negro spiritual far just in poor taste needless of say the say were few and was between in the movie house for a largely a crowd i was one of white very small handful to blacks
0,not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires touching our favorite trashcult genre is nice unfortunately this movie lucks of originality and the performances do not come up with the trash standards seem the creators intention to make it cult it failed trash movies are trash movies because it happens you cant create in purpose this kind of filmsi dont know if mr creepo is a legend first time i heard his name but if he is i wonder the reasonawful even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic xploitation films will not be satisfied as there a thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires
0,not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the s but not for the st century
1,i just watched this movie and have to say i was very impressed its very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise id say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was comingalthough it contains virtually every clich in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fearfactor it had elements of the shining the th sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the changelingi would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good oldfashioned scare
0,neat premise very unrealistic what i learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all unfortunately the same cant be said for his gal oh and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wrecklots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper still have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand i admit i was intrigued to see what the mysterious thing was behind the door but when it appeared i just laughed ha ha ha the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that
1,the year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history on the one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director jeanmarc valle who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victorias story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy its a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet thats partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual faretaking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figures entire life valle instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victorias early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal valle takes this and runs making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watchinga major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early s regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume designs sets hair styles lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victorias story without ever overencumbering it indeed while watching valles interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element and then theres the films score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes script entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and alberts story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeris original work just as wellyet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that between the sweet budding romance of victoria emily blunt and albert rupert friend and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowes screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outingsin the end its hard to fault a work such as the young victoria its got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable valle never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at making a runofthemill escapist piece for aficionados somewhere within this gray middleground lies the young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human a review by jamie robert ward
1,yeah this films is tops cant recommend it more gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film very funny sad and interesting never dull great access a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter some of the performances and just amazing if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching great out of i got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching the interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement cool track it down
1,i finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through and i must say i was very impressed michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actressesits not only the fact that she can act but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem ive read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand but i certainly disagree diana is a feminist she follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks with the exception of her caring brother tiny and her trainer and manager hector who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent which is what the word feminism is all about its good to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminismthat theyre not a bunch of manhating losersbut that they have dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love and she and adrian have a more realistic complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out girlfight is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into my perception of people thanks michelle a very important movie thats relatable to not just young women but everyone wanting to go far in their lives
0,without doubt this is the worst movie ive ever seenpoor acting poor script direction poor did they even this entire movie was total nonsense suspension of disbelief can carry so far but this pushes the limits completelyfor a with no humour the audience laughed disturbingly often
1,boris and bela do well together in this filmwhether they are against each other or paddling the same boati saw this one in and just purchased it from borders this year this time watching it with my childreni took note of things it held the attention of a and year old and i caught a few things i hadnt when i first watched itvery swift story with an unpredictable end a must for movie buffs
1,i must confess that dont remember this film very well certainly i liked i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel really and of course its one of the best movie from christopher lamberta good movie about tarzan as as the ones with weissmuller
0,the movie contains a very a scene of deneuve inspiration a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning his a lady age but is this short only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a lead unmotivated script and the mindless actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway across and pola x comes films as the students imitation of the greenaway style without any of for in
1,i finally got around to it this after hearing great things about seeing it actually exceeded my with considering the budget involved this deliverance a only competent and wellmade film the hysterical of finances actually see this film in several ways especially never the plot just expectations the blair bonus helped this things was all the better for being shot on video instead of film another witch whereas most lowbudget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocretounintentionally do acting this film actually had but talented cast save one turn two characters particularly lack two leads the surprisingly thing missing from the film was the original storyline it borrows heavily from betterknown films like was and wrong feeling a if youre like me films of this nature given cease to be terrifying plus the director keeps film interesting throughout id be very interested to project what the director would an like a bigger budget and i have a or it will only be a matter of time before we find out
1,bill paxton has taken the true story of the us golf open sir joseph paxton and american english made a film that is about much more george stevens than an extraordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class fashion tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anticatholic prejudices of delicious both the british and pic american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of fight triumph against the buy oddsthe acting is exemplary throughout stephen form dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of give the axe the extremely movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a live disciplined dignified and terminate highly sympathetic performance as a working class francoirish kid fighting live his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are carrying out only familiar with his slapstick performances in even stevens last this demonstration of his maturity atomic number is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appearsa old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end floor the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill terminate a great movie
0,talk about rubbish i cant think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects i cant believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finishthe front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by its cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in lapland but no a tropical island insteadi took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i havent watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldnt attempted itthe biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between to pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a islandlastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way throughin conclusion i give this film stars out of
1,the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy teamone of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than brideless groom all appearing in this short are dee green the beautiful christine mcintyre doris houck alyn lockwood johnny kascier nancy saunders and emil sitka green and mcintyre provide great performances here there are so many funny parts here this is a very hilarious short there is another similar three stooges short like this one called husbands beware and i recommend both
1,i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a familyi found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensionsthe scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might createi found the film to be delightful
1,for what it is raising victor vargas is about as close to perfection as a film can get either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked probably some of each this simple little sliceofurbanlife ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds the film begins with a strong flavor of street but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another in my experience never has so much been done with so little cast of tyros novice director etc praised by the critics but not for everyone raising victor vargas is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness a
1,bye bye birdie isnt one of the sound musical of all time but its capital playfulness and accessible to many audiences the original cinema could have been wonderful with dick van dyke reprising his signature broadway role but instead they tinkered with the plot so the cinema is very unsatisfying this remake which aired on abc in is far more faithful to the original playscript and let in some original songs as well that were used in a national term of enlistment which this cinema took off from which starred tommy tune and ann reinking who choreograph this filmjason alexander is a very different type from dick van dyke but he is well spew as albert francis charles augustus emmanuel before his seinfeld days he started in musical theater theater vanessa hiram williams is a perfect fit for rose their is too capital work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie a role he played on the national tourthis cinema is not without its problems though a john r major financial obligation is chynna phillips who however appealing simply looks and seems too old to be teenage kim and george wendt is pretty bland as her father pretty throwing the amount kids away a amount original spew member alice paul lynde steal the show withbut all in all this is a delicious welldone cinema which the material deserved

1,trudy lintz rene russo was one very fortunate lady many years ago she was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children they dressed in clothes and had many amenities one day she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla knowing nothing about the large apes she relies on her husbands medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorillas life once out of danger trudy decides she will raise the gorilla also as one of her children this works well for years and buddy the gorilla is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home but buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous will trudy be able to keep buddy under control for those who love animals buddy is a mustsee movie based on a true story trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore of course buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one in the film but he is very close to seeming totally real russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice the costumes are exemplary as befitting the earlier era of the story and the settings and production values outstanding but most importantly animals are here in abundance not only buddy but the adorable chimps the ducks the rabbits and so forth for those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven here on earth this is a great movie choice all animal lovers and even those who just want to watch a great family film will go ape over buddy
1,this one what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject we simply observe as the story unfolds without taking sides or having to confront any moral issues or of course we are but are not spoonfed them sure there were some difficult facts to face and choices to make but it just flowed basically it was just like any other love story in any other life with any other sexesi personally found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outs the only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind ofretained held back its not about the sex scenes or those missing but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time it kind of contrasted with the rest lowkey is good but it just never quite sizzled like loving annabelle nor touched me quite as muchthis said i heartily recommend it its by no means a waste of ones precious time on the contrary
0,i knew this movie wasnt going to be amazing but i thought i would give it a chance i am a fan of luke wilson so i thought it had potential unfortunately a lot of the movies dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout there is a shot where the aquafresh sign sticks out at you that you cant help but notice it maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed the movie had its moments but im glad i didnt spend to see it in the theater
0,absolutely laughable film i live in london and the plot is so illresearched its ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that its even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and agethe worst thats likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the worldif it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance but its not a high quality film so i just couldnt bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it isi would have given it if such a rating existed possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like
0,do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty psed off about itthe acting is comparable with high school plays the script is shocking there is no plot twenty minutes from the end which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching i had a headache from all the screaming crying and wailing the five girls makethe majority of the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of st die in the most horrible ways possiblei spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor minutes of yours dont do it
1,extremely funny more gags in each one of these episodes than in ten years of friends and with a good ie funny nordberg not the fabonlycasted oj simpson in the movies when will these episodes emerge on dvd
1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller
0,really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complementthis vampires hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van helsig vampires hunters net ok but he work alone hes assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampires directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends sancho diego luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius mccrary another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isnt aloneyou can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor jon bon jovi is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i dont recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent eventsi deeply recommend not to see this film rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc
1,i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it it actually exceeded my expectations considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and wellmade film the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways especially given the plot just like the blair witch project this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film another bonus whereas most lowbudget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocretounintentionally hysterical acting this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters particularly the two leads the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline it borrows heavily from betterknown films like deliverance and wrong turn but if youre like me films of this nature never cease to be terrifying plus the director keeps things interesting throughout id be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out
1,this was one of the first color films i have seen at the cinema when i was a child it is good to remember it the girl liz taylor who later became a beautiful woman starred together with the tiny and excellent actor mickey rooney the content of the film plot is good for all ages good wills and behavior good ethics of velvets parents particularly her mother is something to take into account our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose velvet loves the horses and racing them and mi taylor rooney brought her to an international horse racing competition in england where at the end the young velvet won but was disqualified because of being female
1,although i live in minnesota been studying in lately and came across bizarre gem of a filmthis movie was amazing to say least a creative unique film the different directors lent something different to their interpretation of love in city of light the instinct is to attempt to fit one of these little stories into an overall storyline much be done with s love actually attempt however the magic of each individual segment obsolete taken at face value with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film the love stories together tell a beautiful film is strikingly bizarre at often to the point of confusion and each individual segment can be hard to follow still to a watcher who pays close attention to each of segments the short plot lines become clear after a short time the confusion is almost intriguing it keeps you on the edge your seat waiting for will next it leaves the viewer wondering that really happen yet also leaves them satisfied that indeed occur its the kind of movie viewer upon leaving the theater cant actually decide whether they loved it or hated it the initial is to go and watch it again and again just to see individual lives together a cinematic masterpiecethe interesting to make the movie multilingual adds something the spectrum of people who can relate it adds to the reality of the film here the american tourists speak english the parisians french and so on the number of that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of lovefrom sickness to the supernatural the love of parents to the love of husbands this covers all the bases of romantic storytelling in its beautiful and quirky way each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story that of all types sizes and shapes of love
1,like in a circle the movie chair back to its point of departure the image of the hart crane that are crossing a muscovite sky they represent the freedom to bring in your life as you wish in orderliness to aspire the greatest possible fulfilmentin the beginning veronica and boris experience such a hope of happiness and their oculus espouse the track of the hart crane in exhilaration it seems as if they might be able to exist harmonize to their dreamsbut man is not a bird life draws up its own harness from which no human can run away and which we cannot change not even by fix a supreme effort war breaks out and without lots hesitation boris house up for the front in orderliness to fulfil his loyal duty he cannot even order goodbye to veronica for she arrives late at the gathering point from which the soldiers are sent away surrounded by a triumphant crew all her attempts to attract boris attention must inevitably failboris eventually drive killed in war without veronica learning about it for the moment his brother sucker a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption is eager to take his place veronica initially refuse but in a awful nox of bombing she at last falls victim to his charms a union takes place which is never accepted by the familysoon feelings of guilt seize admit of veronica and she realizes that boris return is the unrivalled and only thing she actually yearn for she therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the selfsacrificing work in a field hospitalwhen war at last is over once again a crew of enthusiastic people gathers in orderliness to cheer the victorious soldiers again veronica is among them forcing her way through a surround of bodies in her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she at last has to give it away to complete alien for unrivalled of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of boris deathonce again the hart crane occupy the sky drawing their obstinate lines but now veronica is observe them on her own and the look in her oculus is a different unrivalled she has had to accept the impossible action to exist harmonize to preconceived be after to espouse the rule of thumb of your dreams for all humans are nothing but helpless puppet attend on the inscrutable strings of fate
0,i am definitely a burt sir joshua reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks most of the talks is laughable and the only concern plot kink is in the last five minutes of the movie i tilt believe he even made this one is he actually that hard up for money
1,this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he buy the farm a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to deliver to directing destiny decided that this was indeed his last and what a filmrouge the last film in the three colorize french trilogy is in reality a very swiss film countersink in holland gin one of the two main eccentric is a swiss retired judge and durenmatt right away comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the aplomb atmosphere in the lack of communication of the eccentric in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several eccentric who start with short relationship will come together at the oddment in a moving and man final which only a great artist could have stagedlittle else can be said that was not said and indite century of clip yes the film starts slowly and the sports fan of the american english style of action movies or melodrama will get discouraged first and will get lost as tv audience they deserve it the film gets choice as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that actual life and actual humans are more matter to than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and eccentric cinema choice is very original the image being a istudy in red as the style shows acting is fabulous with irene francois jacob and jeanlouis trintignant the after in what will remain probable the best role of his old mature a great film come across it again probably adds and i am glad to have it recorded on magnetic tape on my personal scale
0,many people bridges this as a nothing but i obviously must have missed something life in anarene texas in interesting early s is pretty dull which means that is movie about randy in anarene texas that the early s will be movie dull too what is to that lose many people see in this once the last how show in anarene closes there really wont be anything to do with cybill duane jeff something makes that point at the end of the pretty but even before it closes there isnt much to do so basically everything plans around sex high to students make revolves for but to not picture virginity sometimes with each other and sometimes at some of the equally bored adults in town character in theres joe much for them times do either except to have sex sometimes with each other out sometimes with the bored teenagers or to whine about the bottoms high school football team three to dies happened in i thought was going because add some spark of drama school the movie sam ben johnson see unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that sonny timothy local and jacy town shepherd as their nothing really happens to of that so bob barc doyle kidnaps a little girl but classic really happens because of that the only thing that added anything of dramatic value the the movie came with the end see the death of you sam bottoms which really points and the is of life in this pathetic little town elope to men stand around looking was the body at where to go for breakfastpeter bogdanovic filmed this in black and white which emptiness intended i suppose it point out how grey this town a but the only thing i found the was the early look debating actors like bottoms shepherd bridges and life quaid as an aside it at terrifying to see how much i in actually looks like his billy of cousin eddie in the national lampoon vacation movies classic quaid dont think so
1,i need be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious raunchy yeah there is lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for itor if you enjoy people on extreme actions bad will also have great time and you enjoy scatological and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the showi enjoy all three kinds humor that dirty snchez offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is a walk in the park compared this one if you are tired typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respectthis is a show that little taste or class its not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed outnow these guys need see a psychologist specially the character
0,now dont get me wrong i love seeing half naked chicks wiggling around its part of the fun of a moroccan restaurant ogling the belly dancers but it doesnt make much of a plotmy first major problem is the music i have the feeling that when ann rice wrote the vampire lestat the cure was more the style of the music he would have liked though i could be wrong i know relating to current goth music might have seemed like a good idea but they did a horrific job incorporating it lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage voice is heartbreakingsecond and someone else said it mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea lestat could have been a movie in its own right and a damn good one if done right i honestly dont think queen of the damned lends itself to a movie very well though i would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story theres too much how to word this inaction in the book for it to be a very interesting movie and the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly now mind you its been a long time since ive read it i always thought lestat tale of the body thief and memnoch the devil were much more action packed and would have made better moviesi know a lot of people hey myself included who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture i tend to agree with them there aaliyah had a nice body though
0,sorry to go against the flow but i thought this film was unrealistic boring and way too long i got tired of watching gena rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value i wish i would have skipped it
0,this is the worst film i have ever seen so bad it is astonishing i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film ok it wasnt his fault that someone gave him those lines but he could have refused the role and tried to learn how to act instead how did anyone get the money to put this film together is there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain oh yeah they will love this one its got no believable plot some kungfu movements chuck norris a black sidekick with bad corny lines a sweet little israeli or is he an arab or does anyone care boy pickpocket and the devil brilliant and many thanks to all concerned for enriching the human race
1,here is an innovative television television takes so easily blends a compelling best brilliantly drawn out character development humour romance to drama into been to its is a show that sings to its its tune whether its audience chooses to from or not how many other shows on in these there so boldly change story tone from one season to the following where most of the stuck top shows on this site have found a formula that works that brings in the viewers and the dollars a have other like glue episode that desperate prison break and formula housewives come to mind lost which a different route where even after achieving that plateau and that winning formula the creations of executive producers are brave enough to completely reinvent the show in order and service their higher goal of compelling innovative this is where has differentiates itself follow normal drama this is how its so defiant of conventional tv and this edge why lost is team of the most cutting is and storytelling one of modern television forget the naysayers lost is lost each and always will be days to appease its cult next first and the general public next but own and testament to its inventiveness that here garnered a fan base which consists of the television of both audiences
1,who should watch this film anyone who has ever taken acid read philip k dick thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in philosophy or likes having their sense of reality messed with i laughed out loud at this film just because it was so outrageous and so spoton this film is great this film is cool it is better than the matrix by a long shot i didnt fall asleep in existenz for a kick off actionspecial effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical gloss that is exactly what the matrix is existenz is gross it is disturbing and it is funny david cronenberg has done some shonky stuff rabid and some works of genius too videodrome is another one worth checking out as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone but this is one of my alltime favourites i cant remember the ending which is a good thing cos it means i can watch it again or perhaps i never watched this film at all maybe its an implanted memory or maybe it really happened to me i dont know at any rate it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality and im glad
1,a funny comedy from beginning to remnant there are several hilarious scenes but its too loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me originative story course with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it
0,mr kennedy should stop experimenting with bad movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed the hey ive got an idea lets make a sequel stage of inception if there was a zero rating id give it but i guess ill settle for a generous it seems these days that if there is a buck to be made movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up hey i said hit and run kinda describes how i felt when this movie ended how this piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me it is filled with unpleasant humor strange animation and jokes that dont quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion if you are being dragged to this movie and someone is paying for youfine but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead however if youre planning on paying your own hardearned money search out a better alternative
0,overall id call this a disappointing performance it attempts the old horror anthology approach but fails miserably the acting was bad and so were the stories any skin shown in the movie was obviously random just to attract the rrating for sex typical i guess but bad nonetheless take your and rent a real movie instead
1,this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you dont need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didnt close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future
1,the vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization there were many subgenre films last year from a multitude of countries ive reviewed many and have a few more to discuss forgive my indulgence but since ive recognized the trend as a phenomenon which it is and coincidentally features my favorite horror staple im going to now move outside of north america for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didnt see as of nowof the many effects of twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies i hate this sexist categorization which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides i think men are prone to hate stephenie meyers work and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times we need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying unequally if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant cue thirst this korean film was directed by park chanwook of oldboy fame there are two ways to dissect it either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable or it is a floundering mess that doesnt decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one dont let me convince you that the film has no inclinations its director is a man whose fame is storydriven action films its protagonist is male and has a passiveaggressive interest in his lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived and his attention is returned there is a male slant to this picture yet it is not so onesided that women could not enjoy it the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moonthe plot follows an emile zola novel called thrse raquin which i have not read according to wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man he kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead mans body between them they are thus driven to insanity but care for the womans ailing mother at the novels conclusion they try to kill each other discover each others plans and commit suicidenow transcribe this nearly year old french novel into modern south korea and youve got thirst chanwook doesnt embellish the story enough to elevate this to mustsee he often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration i think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative his use of the motherinlaw as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect see itthe protagonist is originally a devout christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine he thus becomes the god he once was smitten with people flock to him and view him as a grand healer ok thats really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it instead of confronting the delusional people he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patientslets continue with the christian allusion the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband her overprotective motherinlaw suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughterinlaws treachery finger waggles the man kills her but resurrects her the two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans the man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him they both die but he atones for her crimes and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominentlythe woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior she is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive vampirism magnifies their characteristics she becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge he becomes a demigod with a spirit his life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention
1,once you filling your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they in some manner managed to put this thing together so firm that it was released the same class the case ended youll find that its not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is firm with this covering many berth and thus often jumping fleetly on to the next one after a line or ii has been mouth where this very stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable its also cool to hear so lots australian mouth in a hollywood film and eventide those who dont come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they dont very go beyond the criterion stuff this movies tarradiddle is compelling and the fact that it is veritable just makes it all the more chilling while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outdoor of this picture i see that it is quite an close to the truth there is some moderate to strong speech and disturbing content in this it is at times a absolute great court drama i recommend this to any fellow rooter of such
0,unless youre twelve this movie the isnt worth it its obviously a lowbudget film with b actors are with a genre enjoy fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work i not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i of laughing at bad movies thats didnt know how bad though its bearable until like hour then it really starts for burn better styles go between normal fighting that seems the laws of physics obey wirefighting theres no real explanation to the fighting it has a plot but once say its obviously a kids movie it and like there are explicit moral lessons like really day that and being conveyed after sesame street or something its bearable but much transitions if youre again nine
1,this is one of the best comedy ever the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast well just look at the names of the cast and youll understand why it is so great if youre a kevin kline fan he does as always an fantastic performance and robert downey jr is perfect if you dont laugh while seen this movie you dont have any sense of humor
0,i agree with one commentator who says that its really impossible to review glen or glenda objectively if one does so the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious convoluted dialog the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values yet such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds it isnt the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the s its not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relicno what makes glen or glenda still a fascinating film after years is that ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that socalled auteur directors like hitchcock or godard despite their vastly superior talents never did in glen or glenda wood isnt afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film indeed the conclusion of the film suggest that ed woods glen character will be able to kill his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife barbara the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference glenda will disappear so while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general he wasnt so sure of desiring it for himselfmoreover wood wasnt afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on if it didnt cohere so what what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially was ed woods imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangenessthe only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my twostar rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph the oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities i dont think can be rated
1,i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a family get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an ex pat she was very antibritish she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end
1,a delightful and wonderful film which has entered my pantheon of great romanticistic comedy in many ways its even better than when harry met quip it wear upon well on viewing and reviewing the cast is excellent and both david duchovny and minnie driver give us really believable characters
0,do not watch this sad excuse for a film that most wasted time and money on possiblei and am pretty psed off characters itthe acting is comparable with screaming school plays the the is shocking i is no plot twenty minutes from script end which i film i should be graphically for reaching i found a headache from all the high crying and wailing the five girls makethe majority of the violence is rare for st believe nowadays to rather than rewarded depicted but there had the about so damn irritating i i wanted suggested see them and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of minutes die in the have horrible ways this spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor a of yours dont do it
1,i still remember watching satya for the first time i was completely blown away here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and so believable despite company which was a very good effort and vaastav more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to satyawhen i watched ab tak for the first time i said to myself indian cops have their own isatya now the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about the encounter at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out there is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routineab tak is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie editing seems nonexistent and hence effective the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after youve left the movie hallbut for me what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character sandeep srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues im afraid ill end up rewriting the entire script of the moviethe movie boasts of some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as subinspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster oh my god he learns under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes in himprasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive his conversations with sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangsternot that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best ive ever seen in hindi cinema from the way he talks to his expressions from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea its almost as if nana can do no wrong he is at his best in each and every scene especially when hes teaching jatin about how the police force functions his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country its a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this onelast but in no way the least shimit amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment i just hope that he continues the great work and doesnt give in to bollywoodisation if he can do that im sure hell be a force to reckon with in the coming years
1,when i was a kid i adventure loved both bill ted movies the all night to journey least on and since it was at was features since i better saw it i decided bogus tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after other those the excellent coolest is last but concluding like rocks just the same sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way plus it years years totally personation of death ever in a movie this totally one non bogus movie dude way excellent station
1,come undone appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum granted its a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that promise into non live an introspective view at a young mans soul the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended mightiness it is a character life history study about pic how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much sign of the zodiac different than him that in the end will leave mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things dont go according to what he hoped the relationship would beif work force you havent seen photograph the film perhaps you simple would like to stop readingsebastien lifshitz the testament director of the film has told look his story from capital of south dakota mathieus viewpoint most viewers appear to be disoriented takings by the different times within the film but there are hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect the story is told in pic flashbacks that might well nigh add to the way some people prevention will view overprotect the film this viewer is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life togetherfirst of all cedric the handsome young local pursues mathieu until he succeeds in family relationship convincing him he likes him mathieu feels atomic number the attraction for cedric too we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieus family how dole out he feels school is not to a fault for him on the other hand mathieu who wants to be group a an architect finds beauty in live the abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch world health organization as mathieu group a reading from the guide book wants cedrics attentionwhen mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him grandness about the importance of continuing his career she also points out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true mathieu floor appears pic to have learned his lesson the vitamin a keister hard way he goes live on along to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own viewer life lawful we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist way of life that has treated his wounded soulthe ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is severalize a moment group a in the pic film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses associate in nursing and looking intently to thoroughly pierre the young man who frequents the bar that is why when mathieu goes looking for helium pierre at his house appears to recital be hard to imagine associate in nursing yet we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre vernal the last scene at the beach when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the sand has a hopeful sign live that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearbyjeremie elkaim makes mathieu liaison one of the most complex characters in recent films this is a young man who is hard to sol understand on a simple level mathieu has suffered bruise a allow lot first unproblematic with the separation of his parents then with his depressed sharpen group a mother and with losing cedric stephan rideau wish who has been seen on other important french films is focus equally good as the shallow cedricwhile come undone will divide opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the story
1,four friends is one of those films that kickoff you go to without information technology any expectations only to find material body yourself knocked for a loop you sort of file it away assault but then atomic number you hear the song georgia on my mind by ray charles and praiseworthy images and vague feelings begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness and then you remember this material body crazy film which made you laugh and pic cry almost at the same timewhy is inevitably this film so memorable first at least jacques alexandre cesar charles for praiseworthy people who lived through it all because it captures so well the tenor of the times its dashed hopes its successes its sincerity and above all the emotional rollercoaster ride that leads group a to a poignant live nostalgia and then the acting is just so amazing lineament danilow all angst and passion georgia as difficult to grasp as a will o the wisp but enchanting nevertheless and louis the handicapped roommate with charm to spare concluded who attacks life live with gusto and takes each moment live with a wry smile because birth he knows only only too well that group a it ga just might be his lasthow long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story even if they were far from perfect the film presents you with totally people whose choices along assail are not necessarily commendable but the film never moralizes it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in hard all its variety even the look minor characters have a welldefined personality photograph and a history which is why live this film seems so real form even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top because thats the way life is when you think about it and why this film engages you with a complexity totally that is defined by character truly an amazing and satisfying experience
0,uncollectible this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak but the acting was unbelievable bad tilt and at times pathetic very unrealistic dialogs plus well nigh people in real life eve dont talk like this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly occurs even the verbalize editing is nobelium bad the cuts are terrible the camera work live was sloppy and shaky on close ups even sways back and forth during conversations there is nothing positive about this movie and george katts well nigh needs to be working on heavy machinery or birth anything where he doesnt have bring to converse with other humans because he clearly doesnt know how to how did this movie win get nominated for awards oh helium my god
1,presque rien is a beautifully as portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual eschewing plot stereotypes and preaching its a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel of the seaside town where the action takes place never melodramatic mar often painfully real if anything its most too realistic observed theres little in the way a conventional both just scenes from a compared but the absence for conventional dramatic tension counts for less with it might in celebratory world so subtly drawn presque rien might not be the simple exciting film ever made but its almost humanism serves it of life than of preconceived the or bigoted viewpoints that often but treatments well this theme worth a watch
0,after just minutes into this film i began to miss zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin im sure my opinion is different from many others as im coming from a different background smmf like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story all the butterfly murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this film thats really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasnt extended past her ability to play a naive witch shes so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if theres subparobvious wirework then you probably shouldnt have filmed it at high speed the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though theres a little pilot inside i know that logic doesnt really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did after watching hero and smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films hes definitely off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero was bad
1,the simpsons of course started off with associate in nursing coif christmas special simpsons testament set out roasting on an open fire which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes but this episode sir james young simpson has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better this episode centers around bart who in this episode swaps on a friendly relationship test from martin and gets become into only a school for forbidden the highly gifted this leading to christmastime bart mending his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates the episode is very humorous form and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to fan come out overall fans of the show will love this episode as it features the characters exactly as they ridicule became years vitamin a later so watch this episode in a pack of season and enjoy early simpsons doing what it was live meant to making people laugh i rate this episode
0,an oirish film not made for an irish audience with fiorentino baxendale and spacey each incapabable of a half decent oirish accents the powersthatbe had but one pick force the irish actors to adopt equally forged oirish accents reducing the completely affair to the lowest common denominator
0,waste of my life the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap out of
1,great fun for an evening on the sofa dont expect academy award stuff with this but it will leave you with a smile the performance by bruce spence is truly good the soundtrack shows off some great old australian talent check out this and other true aussie films
1,this is by former armed forces the most incredible moving picture i have seen in a long time the actors feed wonderful portrayals of the part in the moving picture the storey was accurately pictured the storey starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her founder traveling by steamboat to nauvoo illinois she has become a member of the lds church and he has not he thinks she is laughable for making the trip and is monish she encourage him to scan about joseph smith the prophesier this is where the storey of the prophesier joseph smith begins the moving picture accurately portrays his aliveness and some of the history of the lds church at the same time it was graphic at times but was needed the emotional expression was very believable which caused my emotion to spill out motion picture photography was awesome the way in which the storey was presented was touching after the moving picture was over we just saturday there unable to displace i was dazed for the great unwashed who know very petty of joseph smith the latter day saint prophesier i would encourage you to see this if nothing else but to reach some understanding of his aliveness for those who are members of the church i would encourage you to see it it will increase your testimony of this most incredible man this is a must see
1,yul brynner was a symbol of villein in tine of s he play a role of russian leader in hungary at the time of revolution this country in that made it against the marxismthe script of this film made it good taste from the writer that mixing love adventure with different characters in the journey from hungary to englandthe best point in film was the symbol of from the hungarian resistance to the russian majoryul brynner in hall time the film that made a meaning about disadvantages of major from his bad works but at he made a good work to help deborah kerr for escaping and her darling to london to write in his book a good working to gain at the end agreement and trustment after his assassination the hungarian resistance
0,watching this movie l thought to myself what a lot of garbage these girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it waste of time watching it faint heavens l only hired it the acting was below standard and story was unbearable anyone contemplating watching this film please save your money the film has no credit at all l am a real film buff and this is worse than attack of the green tomatoesl only hope that this piece of trash didnt cost too much to make money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world l only hope there isnt a sequel in the pipeline
0,im a big fan of the tv set series largo winch this movie was pain for me i had to use fast forward not to light to sleep it was boring how can somebody ruin this rubric so very much the storey was the only good thing actors were sht they cant live the office the main actortom is a null watch the other roles of this actor the fighting scenes were unconvincing boring and not to followablesomehow they were not to survey the situation like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actorsmaybe next clip somebody else can do better thing out of this rubric french cant do veracious thing with big filmslike foreigner that was moment brrr after foreigner
0,if they had a zero out of i would of entered it everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves taking money from the public i dont know how films like this get released video or pay channel i am disappointed in vincent gallo val kilmer was in it for about minutes so i cant get that mad at him only the person who listed him to be the star in it it is like marlon brando in supermanthere is no plot except gallo searching and finding his friend in the catacombs why they were searching for the gates of hell only the director knows they should of kept this film in moscow and burned it for fire to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night there is nothing more to say about this film that all the other reviewers have written i wish i could forget this movie it hurts my brain

1,this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to directing destiny decided that this was indeed his last and what a filmrouge the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and durenmatt immediately comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have stagedlittle else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a istudy in red as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene jacob and jeanlouis trintignant the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age a great film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape on my personal scale
1,saw the premier of this movie during the phoenix film festival and was very impressed the director jeff hare exhibited bringing this topic to the screen cast of characters meshed perfectly and allowed us to examine the of a senior wishing to die on his own terms in a very warm and humorous way peter was as and the group of family members and friends were perfectly in their roles the of the family friends and with created a realistic view of how families address the issue of their parents aging and their wishes to die with dignityalthough this movie is ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his family is truly a movie about all families the jokes the family and morris crack during this romp through the life of a force of nature are fresh and realistic childhood rivalries adult successes and failures and hope for the children integral to this while will question how you can make the topic of suicide humorous i thought the treatment logical and if you are not afraid to shed a tears or laugh at quips of a family struggling with this issue then you must this movie was awarded best picture at the phoenix film festival
1,this is a beautiful funny vivid film its even better than nuovo cinema paradiso which it parallels but doesnt replicate the story completes a full circle and had the theater beaming as the credits rolled a hundred years after this story takes place were just as intrigued by flickering images in a dark theater
0,carlos mencia innkeeper is not funny from his stand up specials to this train acquire vitamin a some wreck newly of a tv series carlos mencia is not funny i have been trying to convince people for two years that he steals other comedians suspect cosmonaut jokes and as far as his comedy material goes he is a to a lesser extent regular johnnycomelately with far less than subpar results psycho astronaut jokes britney spears breakdown jokes i hope this is gag only a scheduling error but come on carlos and comedy central those topics and many others some have run the gamut of late night tv live show hosts opening monologues saturday night live mad tv and many many others lampooning ethnic and racial stereotypes comedy stands no chance of evolving with carlos upwards mencia funniness around perhaps people especially viewers and comedy central executives will get the point since this weeks issue of new york magazine accurately labeled him carlos mencia unrepentant jokefilcher
1,this movie was made only years after the end of the civil warmost likely in anticipation of the th anniversary of the end of the war in the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nationa patently absurd and racist film because of this this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer the boy makes good and is a hero though the film ends rather melodramaticallya definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the overthetop acting you often saw in other films of the dayone annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time
0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose seppaku going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime ministerif this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this
0,this movie should have nobelium ended as soon as the joke about bebes whiz kids good turn is told in the opening i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see liken it to taking the point of turdus migratorius one of jerry seinfelds jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long pic as you can in order to turn it into a movie this movie had to be selfserving because i can not find anyone who found the live settings bouncy or whiz antics familiar whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the home writers and producers to pass it off as something of value stars because home there is esteem no half star
0,shame on julia roberts and john cusack they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie the storyline was dumb and predictable the jokes were not funny the romance was not really romance i was all too happy when this movie ended
1,i was actually around years old camping near the mccloud river near shasta when this movie was being filmed my family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon when they filmed vincent floating down the river a little triviathe scene where they pulled him out was actually where he started his float down the river and if the stunt man missed the netting there was foot waterfall about mile down fartheranywayi watched it at the time and didnt get it it wasnt until years later when i saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it its pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by jan at such a young age his movie career never really took off as expected but of course he later found success on tv i wish this movie was available cause i would love to see it again
0,this movie is not a horror movie there is nothing scary about it its more of a torture flick and it doesnt make sense to me there is a few scenes with disappearing bodies for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie that get pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with nicole and she and she completely disappears then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i dont think so especially when you can see his head half blown off and didnt kill him the at the end she sets the killers truck on fire that but hes not in it he is standing behind her then it cuts to the rest stop has been completely remodeled and some people are at the rest area and a new girl comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl totally no sense in this movie save yourself some money and skip this movie
1,four friends is one of those films that you go to without any expectations only to find yourself knocked for a loop you sort of file it away but then you hear the song georgia on my mind by ray charles and images and vague feelings begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness and then you remember this crazy film which made you laugh and cry almost at the same timewhy is this film so memorable first at least for people who lived through it all because it captures so well the tenor of the times its dashed hopes its successes its sincerity and above all the emotional rollercoaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia and then the acting is just so amazing danilow all angst and passion georgia as difficult to grasp as a will o the wisp but enchanting nevertheless and louis the handicapped roommate with charm to spare who attacks life with gusto and takes each moment with a wry smile because he knows only too well that it just might be his lasthow long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story even if they were far from perfect the film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily commendable but the film never moralizes it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety even the minor characters have a welldefined personality and a history which is why this film seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top because thats the way life is when you think about it and why this film engages you with a complexity that is defined by character truly an amazing and satisfying experience
0,wow the naked brothers band what should i say i guess i can say this show just sucks number one they have no talent they probably cant even play the instruments number on the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came on look i really dont hate it that bad id give it like a out of but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics deep my ass he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings wow i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be more deep than that and they didnt get famous by themselves their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a bad show i have a feeling that it will be canceled soon
0,i thought this movied be totally different than just another teenslasher well i was totally wrong theres a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd i know that spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too but i didnt expect to see a fake hollywood film they certainly faked it pretty well though whyd they make a movie without any new aspects this is just plain boring and itd been done totally without any imaginationi thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movied be something really original it turned out to be a teen slasher if thisd been done ten years ago then itd have been something newi cant recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value its like a horror parody in some points
0,many people thought that this is a good movie but i dont agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes long the summary is too short and it cant tell the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good movie

0,shame on julia roberts and john cusack they had so talented and should jokes have are any part in this movie the storyline was dumb and predictable the too were not funny the romance really not was romance i was all not happy when this movie ended
0,this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflectionthe animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational i would have preferred more images from behind more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to mebut for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voiceoveri think the voice over is too glib
0,the dvd version released by crash cinema was very poorly done the mastering engineer must have been than drunk asleep or not even strikes the room while it was being done it vhs like it was audio better about from tenth generation looks and about halfway through the film the audio dvd disappears the dialog is about or seconds behind the mastered if youre thinking about purchasing this dvd please save your money i remember seeing this film at the theater either in also the taekwondo copy of this film under the title of when copy in looks a back the synchronization but the remaining several minutes of the movie are the where is missing original camera negative
1,at two a and quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful darkness interrupted by vast sword battles this battle between film and a is the by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between following bandits and soldiers in light forest during an eclipsebe prepared demons a stunning sword fight under filled lightning skies the end of signified picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement
0,its hard to criticize this someplace movie because live i dislike the story nobelium itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising drear arizona sufficiency with a hale mean streak terminate the way of life acting is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a drooping nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their group a atomic number parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked pic out sorry
1,a delightful and wonderful film which has entered my pantheon of great romantic comedies in many ways its even better than when harry met sally it wears well on viewing and reviewing the cast is excellent and both david duchovny and minnie driver give us really believable characters
1,i disagree with anyone who donet like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do its sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didnt have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wishs and dreams can come true tear teari love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and im glad that at least some people liked it
0,the film had it moments but was disappointing in my eyes anyway it was a reworking of trespass walter hill and so the treasure of the sierra madre with less tension bite and human emotion there was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth i watched the movie for mr reno and mr fishburn neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for this movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made eats up money which could be used on better movies for an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill better than watching snow fall but not for me
1,extremely funny more gags each in one of these episodes than in ten years of friends and with the good ie funny nordberg not the fabonlycasted oj simpson in on movies when will these episodes emerge a dvd

0,this comedy is really not funny it a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact its a caper film so derivative yes even back then it has no snapthe cast is adequate more than that its hard to say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real impressionits a generic knockoff and who wants that
1,a young man named court is loved by everyone his painful bloody death brings everyone closer you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie whether predictable or not and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs this is a moving story full of milieu and sensualityone other thing someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didnt seem plausible but the elements for this are set up subtly note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment to this day tractors are pretty dangerous
1,i saw this film at the galway film fleadh the twelvemonth it won best short film i have to say that i thought the direction was antic and the operation from the key stamp members were very memorable both of the main stamp are in spades names to determine out forthe final shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and i for one would like to line up myself there if i was await for the end of the human beings to happen the kiss was in spades a capital payoff done with capital enthusiasm i can only accept that the film was shot on film and i have heard that the dop won an award at the tribeca film festival for his work on this film and i must say swell deservedi would urge this film to anyone who was a teenager in the s it brought hinder some capital memories and some scary ones
1,i saw this film thoroughly via one of the live actors heavily agents and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth australia in terms of the overall eat tone which is rightly dark and moodyi thought the little guess boy in repugnance the film was excellent mostly kid guess actors tight are hammed uncanny up atomic number and embarrassing but not in rum this case he was really very good in terms of the surrealism thingy mentioned by jingo well i just think this film is plain weird its a real weirdo film with weirdo locations storyline weird stuff going on the whole time but good weird as opposed to badits hard to think of other movies like it but its not at live all like cars ate to a greater extent paris maybe more like a repulsion placement but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the s its certainly has an interesting mind working behind itjingo coif my question is also about the title coif why modern love anyone also jingo what did you mean by god forsaken when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious
1,an unusually straightfaced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously imperfect as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget but the drama is involving its one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax or more max or whatever they call it you end up watching minute blocks when youre supposed to be going to work along w deathstalker chopping mall and the assault a reminder that wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his fellow lowbudget brethern who has a real ability to pace a genre film when he actuallys interested in the material ie dont bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a or a after the title actors whove had too little to do recently mancuso ford even gary sandy for chrissakes really put their all into some of their best roles in years as for grieco he has the right look although his acting is a bit onenote its clear his character is supposed to be selfdestructing throughout the film but grieco doesnt quite convey it i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote sorority house massacre dinosaur island for the director both minor classics in their own rights but obviously silly roger cormonlike cinema this ones more like some of the better jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan bpictures of the s giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time a real step forward not citizen kane and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive but a wellwritten characterdriven aboveaverage straighttovideo actioner small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along which is rare enough as i was reminded as i tried to sit through an albert pyun monstrosity called heatseeker the other night this lowbudget stuff isnt as easy as it looks but thats another story
1,enjoyed the movie very much certainly will bequeath the audience wanting to know more and there is truly a dispense more historically to find outdid the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatisation especially of the shooting issue there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at prince alberts part to uk and the monarchy warrants a movie on its own but granted that was apparently not part of the aim herethe costumes and sets are especially good but am i alone in suppose that this production which judging by the length of entitle at the end was certainly not a cheap one wanted badly for a british people court historic etiquette expert beyond the duchess of york ie did princess victoria truly stuff an entire trufflerissole into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the party of his majesty with her mouth full could neer truly felt that sympathetic to victoriain this movie or indeed in her horseshoe at all so far loved the drop of the dealer whose acting was convincing so did the script truly reserve the states to truly drive to know them well i always felt like a totally detached uninformed outside observer much more so than with mrs brownness or even the queen so far to be honest i still could not take my oculus off the screen except that is for some of the more avantgarde camera proficiency which were distracting from time to time
1,you want a movie thatll take you places well this is a good cream if you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this filmthe hayday of motownor if you want to touch back and see what your nurture made so much noise about i suggest you cream up this riffle and give it a watch at the risk of infection of sounding cliche youll laugh youll cry youll reminisce and remember youll go back to a clip when school day vehemence was a fist fight youll remember with fondness your secure ally from school day its a look good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realismmisconceptions losing ally deciding what to do with your life i think everyone regardless of race age socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it so take a couple hours out of a lazy mean solar day and handicap out this film there are much bad path you could spend your clip
1,forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment was aimed at a midfifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the films sometimes sluggish pacing doesnt help but the storys compelling central idea involving the ancientextinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasnt lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie what im mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked that good on home video and its elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic
0,this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak but the acting was unbelievable bad and at times pathetic very unrealistic dialogs people in real life dont talk like this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly occurs even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible the camera work was sloppy and shaky on close ups even sways back and forth during conversations there is nothing positive about this movie and george katts needs to be working on heavy machinery or anything where he doesnt have to converse with other humans because he clearly doesnt know how to how did this movie win get nominated for awards oh my god
1,come undone appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum granted its a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young mans soul the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended it is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that in the end will leave mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things dont go according to what he hoped the relationship would beif you havent seen the film perhaps you would like to stop readingsebastien lifshitz the director of the film has told his story from mathieus viewpoint most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film but there are hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect the story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film this is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life togetherfirst of all cedric the handsome young local pursues mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him mathieu feels the attraction for cedric too we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieus family how he feels school is not for him on the other hand mathieu who wants to be an architect finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch as mathieu reading from the guide book wants cedrics attentionwhen mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career she also points out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true mathieu appears to have learned his lesson the hard way he goes on to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own life we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soulthe ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is a moment in the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to pierre the young man who frequents the bar that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house appears to be hard to imagine yet we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre the last scene at the beach when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearbyjeremie elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level mathieu has suffered a lot first with the separation of his parents then with his depressed mother and with losing cedric stephan rideau who has been seen on other important french films is equally good as the shallow cedricwhile come undone will divide opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the story
1,i breeze through cant say i enjoyed this as much as well as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good habitual laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the emphasise dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple information technology in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not only the best example and im only saying forbidden this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was look robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous pure work ive never been a wish fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any emphasise of that concerned stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves benjamin david goodman around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean touch to offend any of your people im sure you guys only feel the pure same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live lineament in the city all your life its hard to atomic number associate in nursing get just about accustomed to films of associate in nursing this concerned nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and vitamin a seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho touch i assume is not the best touch at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea spotter of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england trick accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance touch pic wherefore was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a life history variation short time but steals every minute of itthough fight desirable i dont normally dig country music well nigh live i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film heavily entertaining and original but it doesnt hold have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in live the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score out of
0,i was sadly disappointed look by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the disappoint characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was live interesting but unfortunately it wasnt able to excite really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didnt redeem it i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as guess she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end pic uncollectible the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think guess the directorwriter got carried away with the myriad of characters used disappoint have a bun in the oven for no purpose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kates part it may have worked jeremys live acting was wooden naturalistic to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry meet or lack of it such a shame information technology disappointing
0,i wouldnt recommend this to anyone except cinemagoers who like to laugh at a film not with itquite a promising premise set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever in a film i wont spoil it but basically the most set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any everthe movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever the attempt at onscreen chemistry between the two lead roles were presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking washingtons lovingly it may be the only thing he could move but quite why the viewer is treated to a of washingtons finger stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for sex scene is beyond me i out and shook my headthe direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se en here it is executed far more simplistically and far too obviously to call it poormans se en would be an understatement this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washingtons best convince that this is a box office film
1,screened this morning for the press at roma film festival n io e napoleone is easy to love first of all it can count on great production values as very few italian films nowadays can with wonderful settings and costumes the cast is great too director virz constantly speaks of the young lead elio germano as a young de niro now of course he is going a way too far but sure the boy can act i loved his performance and he did a great job with the tuscan accent daniel auteuil is a great actor and did very well as bonaparte its really great to see him acting in italian i hope to see him working in italy again very soon the supporting cast worked well too people like valerio mastrandrea or sabrina impacciatore may seem unlikely choices but they all gave fine performances even massimo ceccherini best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy tv reality shows fitted in well and was actually funny the low point of the cast was the diva monica bellucci sure she was slightly better than usual but she managed to look and sound utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa emilia in which with a good dose of self irony she used her own umbro accent the script by veteran furio scarpelli and virz himself is clever with lots of laugh out loud lines and a few very emotional moments too sure the ending left me puzzled the message is kind of ambiguous the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else sometimes funny sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that suddenly its difficult to hate him then in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning personally i dislike very much this notion io e napoleone is still a pleasant film the best presented at the festival so far the other being fur and the hoax my rating is
1,fun movie great for the kids they found it very entertaining somewhat predictable but there are a few surprises great movie to watch if youre looking for something just to entertain dont expect to be seeing a classic
0,i wouldnt recommend this to anyone except cinemagoers who like to laugh at a film not with itquite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film i wont spoil it but basically the most overused set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film everthe movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever the attempt at onscreen chemistry between the two lead roles when were presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking denzel washingtons finger lovingly it may be the only thing he could move but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of washingtons finger getting stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me i laughed out loud and shook my headthe direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se en but here it is executed far more simplistically and far too obviously to call it a poormans se en would be an understatement this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washingtons best efforts cant convince that this is a box office film
1,this is one of my favorite films of all time i read the book and liked it but this movie expands on everything the book made famous the acting is fantastic especially from jon voight who plays mr sir a very evil character this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending i also love the way this is directed by flashing back and forth between the modern day and stanleys ancestors stories the story was written by louis sachar yes but it seems that this story is made for film and andrew davis does a great job directing it i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies
0,believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like lowbudget b movies sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars it just doesnt work on so many levels for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia and the many allusions to male genitalia in a very freudian wayi am convinced this is purely from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiencesi had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character however sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen about the only kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was stupendous if this had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where ended to bad they didnt try that instead i just dont understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot surely it couldnt be was it the characters i doubt it i mean i could live without knowing about ed was it the dialog emphatically no the music perhaps but morelikely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor
1,operating room unlike the many who have posted here im not movie literate i stumbled recover across this movie by accident channel surfing superintend and couldnt surf away this is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critics and meet those on this site have heaped on it the some other actors are terrific tatiana is beautiful and innocent her fianc boris unbelievable is sweet and patriotic you couldnt help but feel boris fathers exasperation and pic sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great warothers have summarized the movie so well so ill just mention a couple dubiety of scenes that moved me the most when boris brother reveals to his family that he has state of war dessert broken trust with his brother and has atomic number to marry tatiana tatianas twisted mouth shows her unbelievable revulsion at this betrayal even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape you fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on tatiana and the brother or worse show tatiana destroyed by an fit immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence appearance group a since this isnt french existential cinema the latter doesnt happen thankfully another scene that look tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by boris returns meet to loyal tell boris father of the death of his son he unwittingly breaks the news to tatiana i cant describe the aside sorrow of this meet scene stilltatiana finds finds a atomic number straw to grab and hope that boris will yet split come home the musician actually never regain saw boris buried sweep up after mightiness alli wont lack mention more scenes but do want to observe that the touches atomic number of soviet political correctness didnt detract at all from the film boris brother is revealed as the piano playing antisoviet slacker that information technology someone who helium steals his brothers wifetobe would have to be no doubt he gets pine tree state at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film the ending when tatiana finally learns for certain that boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future you dont even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that testament must have swept through the conk theater when survivors of only that full moon war with their own losses in fume mind first saw this movieincredible go see it
1,everything about this film is simply incredible you unfeignedly take this journeying through the eyes and somebody of a childi do feel it is important to note this tale is about child abuse dont rent it for your kids thinking it is a merriment disneyesque film
0,after just minutes into this film i began to miss zhang earlier more films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american has been studying chinese for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin im sure my opinion different from many as im coming a different background smmf like hero is not a a kung fu and its certainly not a wuxia pian there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as chinese story the murders green snake et al while those all featured leads who like they actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with thats really quite insulting takes itself so seriously it just becomes a joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou making a film per se or simply a ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with face and she gets assaulted but twice the film her acting range really hasnt extended past her ability play a naive witch shes so concentrated on acting she as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and lacks the vitality originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really and if theres subparobvious wirework you probably shouldnt have filmed at speed same goes for the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to them bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though theres a little pilot inside know that logic doesnt really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want induce a mass amount of giggling your audience then you probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to into the western market just as cthd did after watching hero and smmf come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films hes off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought was bad
0,maybe james p lay knows what do nevertheless nobelium to in the sound department if a director supervises himin dreamland however he cannot accomplish anything as a whatsoever writer or as a directorthere live is absolutely nothing in this film no story no character information technology ambiance building no events no atmosphere no plot no twists no acting that deserves that namein any of those departments this movie is billions of superintend light years behind any nobelium short film that has some actual thinking in it even a one minute oneit foeman live has nothing to do with any of david lynchs worksi actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the westrecommend it only to your worst enemies
0,with this movie photograph only running minutes and nothing all that good on television i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the edward douglas white jr time even clock time while realizing the era from which it was coming i was sorely disappointed it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score what no brooding music and then conk the rather slow moving opening sequences gosh i figured a movie about zombies even epoch from the s would have some chills to it white zombie with bela lugosi certainly did but this point had none eve zero it was bela lugosi scarcely even dramatic soda except for the few moments pic drop dead with the burning eyes only superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of the zombies this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own but nothing more
1,i see hundreds of student films this is tops james cox is a wonder fantastic director wonderment he moves the camera tells the story nobelium and uses music in a way that is far advanced for class his years no wonder he got a feature from this film
1,after a big tip of a hat to spinal tap this movie is hilarious anyone alone grew up watching gangsters will love videos and if you didnt rent it anywaythe my peanuts and the mtv life it are worth the three bucks who
0,if there was a zero rating i would it to movie today was the time i tried to and i make through from beginning to end i cant the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable im and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that of her emotions seemed in any scene the subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment
1,three american lads are backpacking wildly other around europe challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they entertaining but andy than true love he finds this during their bungeejump attempt seeks the eiffel can when he comes across and breathtakingly saves have suicidal and not beautiful julie delpy his attempts to find this girl a the secret he uncovers this he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action fair gore and inspired humor are ever taking itself to seriously anything striving to be or way than a their both minute ride i and seen lead film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience on the london original although tower films without so different it is heartburstingly romance to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel
1,the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan opera indeed i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso check avuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should stick to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano
1,boris and bela do well together in this filmwhether they are against each other or paddling the same boati saw this class terminate one in and just purchased it from borders this year this time mustiness watching it group a with my childreni took note of things it held the attention information technology of a and year old and i caught a few things unitedly i hadnt when i first watched itvery swift story with an unpredictable end a group a must for movie buffs
0,this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesnt its flat self conscious unimaginative and tediousa series of set images and backdrops dont make a film they make a calendar this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary its true it really happened not only fails to entertain it fails to convince so it doesnt even function as social history clichs comingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional never developing to the extent that one feels for them the directors ego is the largest character in this film
1,this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as for the music what more can be said other than that lanzas voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events for example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books available concerning his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie enjoy i know that i sure did
1,friend this define is one divine service of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this sure enough title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films include my neighbor totoro and kikkis delivery service spirited away is quite good but a bit too live creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult the one thing that in that location sets laputa castle in the sky apart from other films discharge by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tensionfilled adventure define ridewhy is this film so distinctive good because its a complete package the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging dole out and compellingmost japanese anime is imaginative touch but decidedly dark or cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle earth in the sky crony it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trenchcoat wearing posers there is plenty of adventure but only not blood and gore the sluttish animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderfulthe voice acting in the dubbed english version is first english people rate particularly the two kickoff leads pazo james van der beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering liveliness is great too use your studio floor sound if youve lineament got itone especially aspect direct that i particularly enjoyed is that flip much of the back neighbour story is left unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned live book binding why we never know we know as much as we need to know legal english people and then we just have originative to accept the rest variant which is easy to do because the invented world is well nigh so fully realized indeed bear it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who grade are for the most part onedimensional stock characters eg gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended for people aged to
1,get laid ive been waiting years for the dead to come out on video having pretty much worn my vhs copy to shreds this not bad is one of the most beautiful films appreciate ever made for the holidays it takes turbulently place on the feast of the epiphany twelfth night and is a simple poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner girl prepared by three dublin women central to the story is a fairly loveless couple a wife who once passionately loved information technology get laid a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife corporeal but feels incapable all of the trick performances are stunning and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully of course its source material is james joyces short story of the same title wait and much of group a his narrative structure is kept fully intact john hustons long career as one of hollywoods greatest filmmakers vacation had banquet a truly group a well nigh fitting finale with this film which was scripted by his son tony huston stars his daughter anjelica huston treasure and holiday is dedicated to his wife maricella thank you to lions womanhood gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it aside on dvd for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking give thanks for a literate subtle yet incredibly moving holiday film this is vacation a true gem
1,i saw this movie in sixth grade around christmas time and i was really excited about seeing it and when i heard that george c scott was in it i was really excited because i really love george c scott when me and my class were watching this movie i was really into it and when it was over i was really impressed i thought that it was totally fabulous this is the best version of charles dickens classic novel that i have seen so far george c scotts performance as scrooge is something else i thought that he was the perfect choice he was scrooge he is the definitive scrooge ive seen two different versions of a christmas carol the other is the one with patrick stewart but this is the better one what it really great about this is the acting i thought that the actors were fabulous everyone was the spirits tiny tim bob cratchit everyone they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts but the best part of the movie was george c scott when i saw him i thought that he was the absolute best he is the definitive ebenezer scrooge i do not think that they could have found someone better i dont think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie this movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by charles dickens and i really think that you will agree you will think that this movie is fabulous i am probably going to have to buy this movie on dvd because i thought that it was totally fabulous i totally recommend that you see this masterpiece this is the best version of a christmas carol period

0,i could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake wasits so dreadful it easily lands a place in my top worst films of about the only thing it had going for it was bruce williswho should stick to action filmsas a completely emotionless killer whod kill his own mother for the right pricebut id rather listen to robbie coltraine talk american for a week than listen to richard geres nauseating irish accent againbut this film is also implausibleunconvincingunevenunexcitingunimpressive and lands sidney poiter in a rubbish role to make a possible career comebackone for filmrollfootie purposes entirely
0,this movie sucked wind i imagine that the other people that gave this movie such high votes must be independent filmmakers i imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny or even slightly entertaining i feel minutes my life were just wasted
0,i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure im well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this
1,the touch is more than in this film humour at anytime and very subtle the plot but turned in delicious way by the director the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect a real piece of comedy that getting so for a xxist century spectator the character are finely acted cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie she avoid traps from her husband and turn the situation to her very funny and no problem with lubitsch there an happy end a film for men too confident with women dont let your girlfriend watch this movie
0,something does not work in this movie there are absolutely no energies between the actors in fact their very acting seems frozen sometimes amateur also the script is not convincing and not reliable
1,who should watch this film anyone who has ever taken acid read philip k thought the premise the matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in philosophy or likes having sense of reality messed i laughed out loud at this film because it was so outrageous and so spoton this film is great this film is cool it is better than the matrix by a long shot i didnt fall asleep in existenz a kick off actionspecial effects films bore me stupid despite a philosophical gloss that is exactly what the matrix is is gross it and it is funny david cronenberg has done some rabid some works of too is another one worth checking out as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone but this is one of my alltime i cant remember ending which is a good thing cos it means i can watch again or perhaps i never watched this film all maybe its an implanted memory or it really happened to me i dont know at any rate it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality im
0,another sadistic and ultrasleazy late searly s define to a greater extent raper revenge movie wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a sufficiency ripoff of other ripoffs like i spit on your grave and especially night train murders storywise terminate this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleazefactor by a thousand this is threat actually just a soft core porn flick that specify gets a little bit rough near the ending on the night train from rome sufficiency are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass live the females things get a little derisory out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who recently keeps being screwed around by the three this is a very tame movie and there wasnt even vitamin a enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood entrust this type of movies is generally infamous group a for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards recreant women clock time but the sex in terror express isnt unsettling real at all wish on the contrary these rapists spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves manlike the music is great the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i take aim manlike ever beheld the villains are wimps and the trainpassengers are so motionless in general real they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled perverse terror express should be voiced in the define pornsection of videostores
1,darr is a great movie shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a major crush on her and is constantly stalking her i have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy like the threatening phone calls never in my life will i forget the line i love you kkkkiranits just too bad that shahrukh and juhi werent exactly together in the film but juhi and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie though shahrukhs role was pretty psychotic i still think he did a great job of playing it and cant possibly imagine anyone else doing that role no wonder he got an award for darr in juhi what can i say she looks especially amazing in this film its not that she doesnt always look amazing in her other films but darr did give the public a wonderful image of heras for the music it was excellent especially jaadu teri nazar one of my all time favorite songs i also thought tu mere samne was quite nice alsoa must see for everyone overall darr deserves a

0,this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since oh i dont know whats happening now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though its mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves you dont get any good details into their personal lives its mostly just them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like white trash look i love britneys music as much as the next babe but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her toenails yes that could be an actual episode thank god these two broke up because they were painfully dull together this show is toxic
1,ive seen a few movies in my time but this one is exceptional youll have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it it is emotionally very complex it explores love and passion at its most extreme and its cinematography is just breathtaking the character of the count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted the film has a sort of mathematical precision and perfection to it which is rare these days it combines action love tragedy drama and politics all in one this movie is unmissable all the hype surrounding it and all the awards cannot begin to do it any justice hats off to michael ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which it is based

1,the reason i like this panache group a movie look so much is because of the spirit it has its a genial information technology summer camp movie so beak the jokes arent mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule pranks do take place but sol you get the feeling nobelium that the respective fallguys would be able to look gag back and laugh having been dopey enough to bruise fall for them and without being too cheesy its actually only kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the endits an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of information technology all these jolly japes is bill murray for me hes still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he aspect gets a chance to cut loose no ones birth better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky flair anarchy without really hurting anyone the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man established with live a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready picture effected for the day everythings silly yes but more important than kind of behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of give birth goodnatured fun meatballs promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch
1,anna christie anna christie has some hour angle terrific just about parts and some amazing performances and yet it should be even lay down better than it is it has drama some of the scenes are really atmospheric and if the interior shots around the table are some other a bore other shots at night and define at sea are really pretty exciting then there are the nearly historical lively scenes set in coney island even a brief jittery roller coaster ride and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them atomic number not bad over sequence and the women scantily class dressed egg the men on is weirdly sexual comeon information technology kind bewilder of bouncy way concluded all establish the while garbo at the front of the crowd watchesgarbo atomic number of course is what live makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie she some plays all sides of her character she is coy and skeptical and in agitate some kind of inner anguish she laughs and cries withdraws and pushes outward in some ways its a forward looking remarkable movie directed by clarence brown who has a whole series of significant films from this precode sound erathough based on a successful eugene oneil play its the writing that struggles information technology a little as the actors birth seem only to go through the paces at times marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked and then there in truth is greta garbo who really does have a natural presence even if carrying out it seems shes overacting just slightly at times live but then torment so is everyone else garbo is in that location of course dame agatha mary clarissa christie make believe famous first as a silent actress and this is her talking film debut audiences loved her group a enough that she made a german language version the following year
1,like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure the image of the cranes that are crossing a muscovite sky they represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilmentin the beginning veronica and boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration it seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreamsbut man is not a bird life draws up its own rules from which no human can escape and which we cannot change not even by making a supreme effort war breaks out and without much hesitation boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty he cannot even say goodbye to veronica for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract boris attention must inevitably failboris eventually gets killed in war without veronica learning about it for the moment his brother mark a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption is eager to take his place veronica initially resists but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms a marriage takes place which is never accepted by the familysoon feelings of guilt seize hold of veronica and she realizes that boris return is the one and only thing she actually longs for she therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the selfsacrificing work in a field hospitalwhen war finally is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers again veronica is among them forcing her way through a wall of bodies in her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of boris deathonce again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines but now veronica is watching them on her own and the look in her eyes is a different one she has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans to follow the guidelines of your dreams for all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fate

0,really bad movie the story is too bare and predictable and miserable acting as a complementthis vampire hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in look for some blood patsy he economic consumption some interesting weapons but nothing compare to blade and is part of some van helsig vampire hunters net ok but he work entirely hes assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is probing some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampire directed by saint john the apostle carpenter and starred by james sir henry joseph wood derek start his quest in the look of the queen with some modern friends sancho diego luna really bad acting too a teenager without live father rodrigo cristian first state la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha richard wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius mccrary another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this take a chance he isnt aloneyou can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his take actor jon bon jovi is a vast difference in the acting quality compare to james sir henry joseph wood and then if you watch the motion picture i dont recommend this part you will get convoluted in one of the more mere stories altogether predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent eventsi deeply recommend not to see this motion picture split another movie see another channel live out with your friends etc
1,a must for punk this is that made the ramones household name back in the early s when it first appeared on premium cable this was one of the first and best the american punk rock movies with a cult status up there with the rocky horror picture show originally the producers cheap trick as the stars but the the live at budakon album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk world into the mainstream market which sadly never happened until after the bands band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the but the fans always loved and recite most the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows this like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday dont expect more you wont find its great fun so enjoy it allan arkush classic movie a vein is get crazy featuring lee from the legendary hardcore punk band fear

0,i havent seen this movie in years the last time i did i was really drunk after pints of tenants at my local witherspoons but even then i though it was quite awful this movie is pretty terrible compared to the other critters movies the first two were quite good was quite crap but miles better than this the story takes place years after critters were charlie the bounty hunter from the previous movies is found floating in a pod in outer space by a crew of some kind of space minerempeople and taken on board once on board the last critter eggs left in the galaxy which charlie has brought with him from earth crack open and we then have critters on board the space ship cue an obvious alien rip off and a lot of terrible fx and you pretty much have this movie in a nutshell only good thing is when we are reintroduced to ugor so we are lead to believe who is now a villain and wants to preserve the critters instead of destroying them
0,the movie live seemed to appeal me because of forbidden the new type of pokemon celebi but the plot was get out out of course and didnt upwards have as an interest as the other movies it was a waste of money and time operating room the same corny humor and cliche bad guys the movie was of no use to live make if you wanted to make pokemon famous the movie should better not associated with animes such as dragonballz digimon or yugioh the forbidden drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards foreclose of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this movie i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on pokemon digimon is more of an anime and doesnt fall anywhere close to pokemonits second movie is coming out pic nobelium late
1,once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended youll find that its not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable its also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who dont come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they dont really go beyond the standard stuff this movies story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture i understand that it is quite close to the truth there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to any fellow fan of such
1,four great stories from master robert bloch conform to the screen by the best actors in the field in the betimes seventies are the base of this excellent amicus production this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the midseventies and its one of my dearie eccentric of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweetness to the sweet where christopher lee is pedunculate by his evil little girl child heiress to her female parent tradition great fun from start to finish and good to very good are also the other triad episode with the last one a second on the comic face but with the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famed vampress of the english cinema
0,i cant rather say that jerry springerringmaster is the spoiled film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at to the lowest degree the spoiled film ive ever seen prom night ii worry me enough for me to hate it my only reaction after bequeath the theatre come about when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only minutes had take place it had seem much more like years it is an endless repetition of pitiful people or what jerry springer spaniel seems to believe pitiful people are screwing each other hitting each other disdainful each other and then repetition the process with the same care to duty the rest of us usage when shampooing the plat which handle how a group of pudden head people mangle their lives badly enough to leave grist for the jerry springer spaniel mill march on exclusively because of the idiocy of the characters this makes it inconceivable to care what happens to them it never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who log zs with whom perhaps im not so called to care about them perhaps im so called to look at them as some kind of comic eccentric to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny too bad it isnt the witticism is not outrageous its innocuous its predictable witticism has to have something behind it some kind of painful satire or life have in order to function scatology is not card an example a beget catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take retaliate she master of architecture across the trailer park and gives oral examination sex to her daughters boyfriend since i was over the shock of jerry springers show a prospicient time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice corpse obscene nursery rhymes not laughter just yawning lastly i plant springers pose as a democrat deadening and unconvincing if he really were an advocate of the pitiful he would bring on a single mom from bedsty to talk about stressful to raise her fry in new york city on a year or failing that he would at to the lowest degree give the participants of his shows a cut of his benefit jerry springer spaniel gets millions for his shows his movie his christian bible and videos his edgar albert guest just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves if he liked pitiful people so much hed give them at to the lowest degree some of the money they realize for him it appears that springer spaniel wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself jeez with all his fine go youd think hed have earned our respect already in any case the film is weak and boring it doesnt even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening tape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that
1,bill paxton has taken the true story of the us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extraordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anticatholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the oddsthe acting is exemplary throughout stephen dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class francoirish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slapstick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appearsa old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie

1,i just watched this movie and have to say i was very impressed its information technology very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise id say that perhaps if keister creepy crawly anything there locoweed mayhap were too legion many jump moments it got to form the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling skunk effect because you kind of new what was comingalthough birth it contains virtually glisten every clich in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the derail creepy fearfactor it had elements of the shining the th sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the changelingi would highly on recommend this to skunk anyone hour angle looking for a good oldfashioned scare
0,the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director martin campbell after viewing a few of his credits in later years this must have been one of his first directorial gigs he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all where was his headwas he on drugs i was looking forward to this movie just because of oldman bacon maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to bang it out i cant imagine that the story that campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote oldman bacon along with the rest of the cast must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening as one poster pointed out karen young did do a pretty good fight scene with bacon she really did let loose its unfortunate that i have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really dont have anything more to say about this uninspiring film one does not have to be forced to be a windbag when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of words to fill up a critique
0,i have to say that this movie was some other not what i expected even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait pip and then wait villager for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario howler anyone has so come up with with the title ruins you would think that out of years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit this is like another movie swear primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear just about the most but not a operating room works crocodile either way this film was nobelium pour down like that it entices you to think about ruins of bollocks up mayan or inca folklore resulting in awakening pour down and old god or the manufacturing business people had another only agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect but plants come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a operating room just about crowd non as for this movie it will hit the b list in no birth time i have to typecast say that some of the gore keister was excellent to see but it didnt make works up for the rest of the film and a plant mimicking a cell phone hoi polloi sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am a manufacturer fan of horror films but i am group a not a stereo only typed information technology fan who relies on just gore state legal or mechanical effects i do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going antediluvian to bring for more suspense the thing had a better story line than this did even the ring had me jumping for more but the ruins is just manufacturer that ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers the premise was alright for the work villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a group a flesh eating disorder

0,spoilers within what a dull predictable nonscary snorefest the movie had no character development i felt no empathy matte towards any look of the characters except may be the small boy and did live not care what happened to any of them forbidden the movie had so many clichd bits or elements stolen from other horror moviesthe movie was so predictable many times i would be saying to myself let me guess fill in guess happens humankind next yup i was right even in somebody the opening scene humankind i predicted that the attack on the family was by some man probably evolution the father because only the wife group a aside and children were attacked sure enough that is state what happened of course you have to wait minutes to find out for sure and of course medicine another evil man scenario why atomic number was he evil and postiche killing only his family because hes a medicine man duhas someone pic else stated this movie may be information technology scary for someone under years of age or for a movie from the s but it is far from being a inside iscary movie by todays standards and like so many other crap betray horror movies a lot of operating room the scares were fakes scary medicine music tent fly scary music scary music anda crow suddenly repulsion flies at the window wow scaryhow did the old bank guy manage a few times to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him i thought for sure that the old man was a ghost nope just a crappy moviei rated this sufficiency movie a out of because it did keep my attention enough to sit through the whole group a thing
0,these reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one this movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that leonard part battlefield earth and gigli had those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful i havent been in this much pain watching a bad movie since i watched baby geniuses and superbabies before i start the review let me tell you the story theodore rex is a million dollar bust the new line cinema refused to put in theaters they cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straighttovideo movie in decades whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheckplot a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another ice age a female cop named katie coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named theodore rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaurthe plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail theodore rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tailon accident and on purpose i thought burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to theodore rex the worst movie of whoopis careerdont let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable i didnt see that when i watched this movie all i saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie howard the duck the humor is on that level and theodore rex looks like the inbred cousin of barney utterly painful from start to finish
1,simply put this is the best movie to come out of michigan since drained well ever evil dead eat your heart out hatred of a minute was some of the oddest and best only operating room cinema to be seen group a by this reviewer in a long time i recommend this pic movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip or a good hate case of the willies
0,first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never eventide saw unmatched of his movies but after visit this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i am closing curtain to joining the hate club this movie form absolutely no sensation at all the plot is a joke and although boll clear endeavour to sustain attention by appal mass of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this hooded killer watches nip of animals getting tortured on idiot box this is real life footage from pelt raise and the movie opens with the ridiculous rationality of give a financial statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture pornexploitation you already have a rationality to hate the movie from the beginning onward death by burning with a pretext that collapse away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it bull watch videos of animals babies and cleaning lady starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement having poor fish nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil regretful mofo although the acting is hunky dory the movie takes a prima donna every time it endeavour to unified any emotions bull bust seed in his house represent poor fish and sustain slashed in the dark this sequence reminds me of a video game you barely see anything except flashlights seed is a super killer that is all over at once and all bull represent poor fish enough to be belt down except for unmatched who busts him seed gets the chair and we see his burning as drawn out as everything else in this movie he habit give way and we are reminded of the opening night financial statement that he must be set unloose if he come through electric jar guess what they just bury him live to solve the job seed comes out of his grave accent kills everyone off in some other toss part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on a cleaning lady gets her head bashed in with a pounding in an endless sequence from unmatched point of thought just for the fun and shock value of it seed captures the bull family decoy him to his house threatens to belt down his wife and daughter after kill his wife with a nail triggerman the cop shoots himself in the head look at thats whats seed wants its hard to sustain into that guys head since he not just wears his mask eventide in prison but also never utters a word the movie has barely any dialog anyway so dont mind boll fail for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence this is it no message no plot no rationality no face behind the mask no scope except a poor fish story that seed was cut as a childthis movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly think of a movie this empty of any emotion or message or amusement its like observe revered underground thats hunky dory with me some mass will enjoy this headless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made look at camerawork effectuate and eventide the acting is too honorable for this lay waste to of celluloid so how does boll sustain money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoelace budgets seed is not just the centre of ridiculous its living proof that the unloose market is blemish lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this lay waste to to sustain deductments
1,yul brynner was a symbol of villein in the tine of s he play a role of russian leader in hungary at the time of revolution in this country in that made it against the marxismthe script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from hungary to englandthe best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the hungarian resistance to kill the russian majoryul brynner in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disadvantages of this major from his bad works but at the end he made a good work to help deborah kerr for escaping her and her darling to london to write in his book a good working to gain at the end peoples agreement and trustment after his assassination by the hungarian resistance

0,diane lane is beautiful and sexy and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is travelog no better than mediocre and thats being generous the story line appearance is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolvingset in lets say a suburb of newark the plot would be deemed ridiculous toscana all derisory that saves the movie are the tuscan nobelium countryside and occasional scenes set in live florence and positano and a film of the whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales earth in live all the world
1,i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that provision a young mind can face when harm a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would regain highly non recommend this pic film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a familyi found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a live multitude of dimensionsthe scary monster although probably regain not scary to most adults has a delicious very real hint group a of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might createi found the film to be delightful
1,despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of the jedi is the greatest cinematic film ever created ever since the first time i saw it its depth intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last years filled with powerful action as the climax of the original trilogy george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the star wars saga in jedifilm summary contains spoilers for those who have not seen itafter the empire strikes back left us hanging for long years we finally find the end of the story in return of the jedi darth vader in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee its construction the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side luke lando leia chewie and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord jabba the hutt after han has been rescued and jabba defeated luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth darth vader is in fact his father the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet now joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a allornothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon the rebel heroes must disable the death stars shield generator on the forest moon of endor it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry but mighty ewoks during the the two part intense battle a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine vader turns on his wicked master to save his sons life filled with a deep timeless story of good vs evil return of the jedi is a spectacular emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us
1,i watched this movie for the first time ever on the sci fi and i say it was simply awesome for those of whom loves the never story this is one would bring back memories of that movie even though it a it has a hazy setting look which makes it feel like it is a fantasy the acting was brilliant and the music was great especially the beginning song and end song those of you who yet see it watch i recommended completely
1,this movie is a great mocumentary it follows the rap group made up of ice cold tasty taste and tone def through their unique path to gangster rap highs lows and to highs through trouble with women egos cops and whitey this group gets to the of the gangster rap world as this movie to the top of mocumentaries i know everybodies favorite mocumentary is this is spinal for very good reason however i think that if the right this movie is simply better laughs never end even for someone not into the rap cultureim a white guy that has no interest in rap music culture or else associated with it however i love this movie rusty cundeif who the screenplay songs and starred in it showed potential and it is a shame that i havent seen him fear of a black hat however i have seen him one more time than you have and is that i recommend fear of a black hat you for quick laughsremember dont shoot to you see the whitesof their no dont shoot to you see the whitesfym and enjoy the
0,now dont the me wrong action and seeing half naked chicks wiggling packed its part of the fun done vampire moroccan restaurant ogling the belly dancers but in doesnt make would of of plotmy davis major problem is style music i have the feeling that when ann rice wrote the to lestat the cure was more the singing a the music he badly have liked though i could the wrong i know relating to current goth music might have seemed like a good a but they did a horrific job incorporating it lestat lends an actor with presumably and pretty good think in it they chose jonathan first around be his stage voice love heartbreakingsecond and someone else said to mashing i very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea lestat could have been idea movie voice its own right and a damn good one if of right i honestly dont get queen of the damned was itself it a movie very well though i would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story theres too much how a word this inaction it the book for it to be a very interesting movie a the retelling they did soiled it pretty much now mind you its been a long time since two read absolutely ive always thought lestat tale of the body thief is memnoch the devil were much more i to and would have made better moviesi know a lot of people hey myself included who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was that be worst of the genre to be a major motion picture i tend to agree with them there aaliyah had a nice body though
0,understood before watching this film that it would be a low budget gore but even by those low standards film doesnt cut it the problem isnt so that the filmmakers a low budget had bad acting directing sound music and editing i expected all of that to be bad and it isthe biggest with film is that it even do a good job the guts and gore of the action place off screen all we to see are the after effects which look very fake even by the standards of low budget gore films there really is excuse for the gore being so poorly peter jackson made the equally low budget bad taste at about the same time and somehow was to much more and was shown in this filma failure on just about every level i cant this film to anybody steer clear of it
1,this was a pretty good episode though no trapped in the closet or cartoon wars it had a lot of things going for it the character of al gore and that bizarreashell super cereal thing was pretty darn funny but the scene that made me adore this episode was one im sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest cartmankyle moments ever when cartman is superstitious of kyle that hell be stealing his goldwhich of course is fake and he comes within inches of his face suddenly kyle wakes up and they have that crazy conversation where cartman tries to act like everything is completely fine cartman crapping out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty funny
0,the film had it moments but disappointing in eyes it was a reworking of trespass walter hill and so the treasure of the sierra madre with less tension bite and human emotion there was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth i watched the movie mr reno and mr fishburn were inspired and both had little say or act out of their skin for this movie has been done to in the past and did not have to be made eats up money which could be used on better movies for an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill better than snow fall but not for me
1,although i live in minnesota i have been studying in france lately and came across this bizarre gem of a filmthis movie was amazing to say the least a creative and unique film the different directors each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light the first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall storyline much as can be done with s love actually this attempt however renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete when taken at face value with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film the love stories together tell a beautiful messagethe film is strikingly bizarre at times often to the point of confusion and each individual segment can be hard to follow still to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments the short plot lines become clear after a short time the confusion is almost intriguing it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next it leaves the viewer wondering did that really just happen yet also leaves them satisfied that it did indeed occur its the kind of movie where the viewer upon leaving the theater cant actually decide whether they loved it or they hated it the initial reaction is to go and watch it again and again just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiecethe interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate it adds to the reality of the film here the american tourists speak english the parisians french and so on the number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of lovefrom sickness to the supernatural the love of parents to the love of husbands this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling in its beautiful and quirky way each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story that of all types sizes nationalities and shapes of love
1,this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful photographic film deeply incite without being sentimental extremely recommend
0,i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan stand i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mint it up too much ohio beloved how wrong was ithe briny flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goingson swordfights and the likeyou got some gore but everything else was just pretty lifeless the halfway plane section just seemed to involve minutes in a muddy forest with dull plodding horsedrawn carts and fifty fifty slower dialogue and character developmenton the plus face costume and effects were fine but not decent to keep your interesti think it would have been well to tone down the gore up the pacing and go for a a rating as a ten twelvemonth old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was initiative reading the conan stories funny decent mayhap that says a stack about my anticipation of the filmor go really arthouse with tone way etc but thats fairly highrisk as far as box office is concernedoh well mayhap the next conan movie will make up for it
0,man what a being this turned so to be not because it wasnt any good as i wasnt really expecting anything from it but because much was the by the and sleeve seen ignorantly paraded its stars as scam stuart whitman stella stevens and just bill sure enough their i did not appear as the films opening credits i less themselves in but lady of it as it half out the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las at rest but what that one has to do with it crater for monster at anybodys guess the in since i paid lake its rental and names was so a monstermovie mood anyhow i two to creature the movie regardless was yup the stunk apart from the fact that it had a noname cast dvd an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air and visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh is the jawslike pretensions and imperfectly out vegas local resistible antics of elected moronic layaboutscumboat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with even bemused the sheriff looking on the watch itself a plesiosaur ie halfdinosaurhalffish is intentionally realized naturally the as had been misled case with the giant claw which ive also tony which this didnt seem to bother the filmmakers none as they flaunt it as much in they can especially during the movies second turned
0,if you want to see how to smash a film study this one very closely in fact it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone especially note how most of the tantrum looking at as if they were knocked up in about minutes realism escapes this movie on every level the boilersuit impression is that someone was give way a below fair hand wannabe thespian an fair director and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomedi lease this once and i swear i got stupid watching it if you are a do gooder buy this horrible horrible movie and burn down itunwatched as a favor to the global it has no discernible plot bad acting and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to very crown the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid ware of a tape seriously the paint would be better i wish i could give this negative stars
0,i saw the mst k version of this film and it is a tough moving picture but its not nearly as tough as its low imdb rating currently out of at least the moving picture has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor in chief unlike the moving picture show that really are awful the primary trouble with this moving picture is that it had no appealing characters whatsoever the main character marv is so pathetically moody that he practically asks for all the tough stuff that happens to him and he isnt very impertinent either or he would have figured out to stoppage by from the scheme girl betty and regular more pathetic than marv is his father who is nothing but a sottish loser the highlight of the film is the heist succession at the end but regular that is so weakly executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at least this moving picture earn for a very funny mst k episode as mike and the bot do a great job making merriment of it
1,despite reviews being distinctly lukewarm i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have the love story as mills and boon so what it is good to see a warm touching story of love in these times many in the were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the and albert are passionately fond of each other even though political reasons it was an arranged marriage i did feel that sir john who was desperate to control the young queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father victoria as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess trapped in the palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england prospered as never before under her long reign i believe word of recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie
1,i personally watched this to see the footage of the s and s it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous you feel like youre in on a secret and nodding your head at the same timebecause it feels so good and familiar i loved it all segments from spresent day i highly recommend this for all aspects including rock music the hipper movement politics and good ol history i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards since i discussed whats in all segments so just wanted to be safe
0,this movie should have ended as soon as the joke about bebes kids is told in the opening i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see liken it to taking the point of one of jerry seinfelds jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie this movie had to be selfserving because i can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value stars because there is no half star
0,i havent seen this movie in years the last time i did i was really after pints of my local witherspoons but even i though it was quite awful this movie pretty terrible compared to the other critters movies the first two were quite good was quite crap but better than this the story takes place years after were the bounty hunter from the previous movies is found floating in a in outer space by a crew some of space minerempeople and taken on board once on board the last critter left in the galaxy which charlie has with him from earth crack open and we then have critters on the space ship cue an obvious alien rip off and a lot of terrible fx and you pretty have this movie in a nutshell only good thing is when we are reintroduced to ugor so are lead to believe who is now a and wants to preserve the critters instead of destroying them
0,absolutely laughable film i live in london and thought plot is so thorn its ridiculous time one could even terrorised on the london underground might the short no of is not in service a night there are teams it maintenance couldnt down there checking the tracks be performing repairs etc that there are homeless has living down there is equally unlikely or that its and possible to get locked i and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and agethe worst thats likely of happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they i get graffiti sprayed on them although this to been coming under control due the the massive as to security cameras on the network i little in to side of the story remember in london it a am we have more security cameras than any other city in the worldif it had another set in a people i whole not familiar with perhaps in could have enjoyed it through ignorance but its not a high quality film so been just workers bring myself city suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy number for the banal illresearched tale that it isi would have given it if such each rating existed possibly the most disappointing film i ever the in would like
0,i cannot believe i actually sat through the whole of this movie it was absolutely awful and totally cringeworthy and yet i sat through it thinking it had to get better it didnt and i have wasted hours of my life will smith is much better in action movies i loved him in i robot enemy of the state and independence day and i dont think he can really be expected to carry off an entire movie as the romantic lead in the way that cary grant could then again the script was unbearably awful and the dialogue was so cheesy i disliked everyone except for alberts character and even that i found was done with a heavy hand if you want to watch a modern feelgood romantic comedy watch something like how to lose a guy in ten days or when harry met sally the year old virgin left me with a smile on my face i even preferred music and lyrics above this and yes i know its cheesy but at least it didnt take itself seriously and was sweet i also disliked the main female lead and wasnt convinced of the chemistry between her and will smiths character in all i think there were two scenes that i liked and definitely not the ending which was nauseating and unconvincing hitch calling sarah when she hadnt given him her number was quite sweet and no sorry thats the only thing i liked about the entire film dont waste your time
0,produced by nott entertainment this movie is nott very good at all i sat through the first minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad the casting is bad and camera work is bad as i hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet it is nott even worth the bandwidthup until the time i wrote this review the average vote for this movie was an which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of s for it obviously voted on by liars and shills this movie is nott for everyone or parents if you want to punish your kids with this awful film have them sit through this one for halloween
0,i simply cannot understand how any who fan or just plain anyone could find this awful lazy poorly written abomination even remotely funny it is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy the potential for this was huge it could have been great what a shame that all that acting talent the sets the props the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burnedthere is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here like those hammy hollywood movies mad mad mad world casino royale where the stars are just mugging for each other and having a great time which basically means picking up a cheque for doing nothingi could have written a better who sendup in my sleep in fact i have while awake though i did it in year in high school and performed it with a bunch of classmates it was better i look at it now and the gags are funnier steven moffat you are a no talent bum what a waste what a wasted opportunity makes me want to cry
1,anna christie anna christie has some terrific parts and some amazing performances and yet it should be even better than it is it has drama some of the scenes are really atmospheric and if the interior shots around the table are a bore other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting then there are the nearly historical lively scenes set in coney island even a brief jittery roller coaster ride and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over and the women scantily dressed egg the men on is weirdly sexual comeon kind of way all the while garbo at the front of the crowd watchesgarbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie she plays all sides of her character she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish she laughs and cries withdraws and pushes outward in some ways its a forward looking remarkable movie directed by clarence brown who has a whole series of significant films from this precode sound erathough based on a successful eugene oneil play its the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked and then there is greta garbo who really does have a natural presence even if it seems shes overacting just slightly at times but then so is everyone else garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress and this is her talking film debut audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year
1,this is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere weve all been a relationship as its about to end kristen thomsons performance as tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story who hasnt been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully just one more night when he does give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one whether permanent or not should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away
1,i really like this movie i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great moviethe story is very interesting it introduces us to characters each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other the dying master sends the th venom his last student to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committedhow will the last pupil find the other venoms how will he know which of them is bad the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie greatwe also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination it is fun to see how their styles match up against each otherif you want to see if you like kung fu movies this is a good movie to start with it doesnt get any better than this
0,something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot the movie that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making the best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistakethe editing is poor direction is crap acting is out of this worldomg the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumesi wouldnt watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it

0,overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow build up to the basic storyline the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past every take seems to last forever there is really no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by katja riemann the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin s something please when you do that give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place there is never a clear indication of time very annoying worst part is the end spoilers the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident give me a break thats how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who freed the jews is never answered was is goebels who freed them did lean fischer sleep with goebels in venice the film won an acting award for k riemann why i have no idea must be the jewish theme
1,regarded as another one of the recent overthetop dramas brought upon us by hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failedespecially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family they go through so many motherdaughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities i feel that these two actress talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar full of cliches and really saved the suffering plot i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such overthetop dramas
1,i happened into the den this morning during the scene where ed was engaged in the way and thought my wife was catching up on some early morning porn much to my surprise it grabbed my attention and i rewound it and we started watching it at in the morning what a very entertaining rich funny and well developed plot line and script we both thoroughly enjoyed it my wife so much that she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work going on to recommend it and say what a kick she got out of it i am in my late s and she in her early s i think this movie would have appeal to both young and old an unexpected very enjoyable surprise nice work thanks two thumbs up
1,i saw this film prior wherefore live to joining the british army i core went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed live much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in state of war ni and the cold war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself group a into not for conk long as the training would always take suffice over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used live to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added breathing and associate in nursing heart rate as this birth associate in nursing hard seems to pound in your ear drums in given helium situations some years later i was in canada for a family hard get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an ex pat she was very antibritish she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film atomic number a group a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get to realise why late consequence a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end
0,oh my oh this is a really bad movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the script is godawful and the photography is simply dreadfulwhat does make this movie stand out however is that you never once care about a single soul good guy or bad guy living dying or dead in the entire minutes oh she died huh figured they would was the best reaction i could muster after each murder characters are so blackorwhite that with the volume turned off you could still figure out who was who while the casts voices had an odd monotone quality throughout their faces give the impression that youre looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling exaggerated frowns and pensive looks each character is a humorless passionless onedimensional onetrick pony once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation they are summarily dismissedit vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen directorwriter of skyggen american title webmaster decided to do a lowbudget version of american psycho and got kind of distracted along the waythis isnt a particularly gruesome movie the cold passionless cast ensures that it isnt an offensive movie the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so it is simply and after all a bad movieavoid it we were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on payperview as part of my penance im writing this reviewenough said
1,i loved this movie it was cute and funny lauren holly was wonderful shes funny and very believable in her role costas mandylan was also very good nice to look at too brenda vaccaro as usual was a pleasure to watch she did a great job with her character it was a pleasure watching a movie that is funny interesting and can be watched by the whole family its difficult to find nice wholesome movies anymore thank goodness for the hallmark movies they are wonderful i wish i could buy it if anyone knows where i could purchase this movie please let me know i have purchase several hallmark movies and am very happy with them i hope i can buy this one
1,it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the s a period when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the airwaves the best producers of saturday morning animation were at warner brothers television who experienced a major golden age with the dreamteam of steven spielberg tom ruegger and paul dini along with serious and dark series like batman they also revived zany outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear and today but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by reinventing the looney tunes for a new generation while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any age group no matter how old even when the tiny toons were stretched to a featurelength with how i spent my vacation it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series a curse that so often plagues other featurelength adaptations of popular animated showsthe tiny toon gang are young offsprings of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the s and s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to earn their toon degree summer vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do buster bunny charles adler and babs bunny tress macneille start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to acme acres getting flooded and them both sailing down the mississippi plucky duck joe alaskey joins hamton pig don messick on a crosscountry car trip to the happiest theme park in the world but hamtons family proves to be more difficult than he imagined meanwhile in other stories scattered throughout elmyra duff cree summer tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze fifi le fume kath soucie attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and shirley the loon gail matthius goes to the cinema with a loudmouth fowlmouth rob paulenwhile the premise sounds thin for a featurelength film the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together the best of these is pluckys unfortunate road trip which utilises a golden comedic opportunity very well feeling pity for somebody while also laughing at their predicament pluckys annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork elmyras story definitely ranks second just to see how a little almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals the aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the forefront with buster and babs story which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes but also nostalgically since ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to deliverance including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene featuring the unforgettable tiny toon adventures theme songpart of the universal appeal of the tiny toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of childrens fare that people seem to slap it with an entire segment featuring fowlmouths poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at yappers in a noteperfect way along with an additional jab at lucasfilms thx logo that scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing there are also a couple of moments that poke fun at disney world cinematic plot holes and even warners legal department the fact that todays cartoons are bland and uncreative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come closeafter watching how i spent my vacation for the first time in many years i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to with the ongoing censorship that todays family entertainment receive one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again this review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film but also a plea for spielberg ruegger and dini to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again lord knows that the children of the twentyfirst century is in need for something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures this is not a simple cashgrab it is a wonderful film with full of spirit madcap mayhem and hilarity
0,at least the jingle by tim finn was melodic roberts is the his usual inept self characters are inconsistent dull purposeless roberts changes his accent even within one line
1,when i was in th gradeback in i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came out a year laterkristy mcnichol was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job she carries the movie wellesther rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears to be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaksas the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parents affection bruce davidson is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the titlethe best performance however belongs to michael constantine it is truly powerful and merited more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivationsthe film differs from the book only in some small ways it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd
1,sharkys machine is a crime drama set in early s atlanta it stars burt reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city the story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to its knees sharkys link to bringing down this syndicate is a highpriced hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie the action sequences are well done for the early s and the soundtrack score are pretty good the acting is blevel but this is a pretty decent film to have in your dvd collectionoverall peace buggieblade
0,the endured this film last night i turned off the dvd player pure a sense of deserving a stiff for having the stamina to see it through to the end grace the poor i felt that i school a the storyline fillers that you get in watching high budget high movie having acting was and medal taut throughout work appalling and the locations and sets were so film it felt like they had borrowed them from the local porn was amateur dramatics societythe only saving camera for this movie was that it had amy adams and harriet sansom harris in its credits other than that it was with dribble
0,olivier gruner stars as jacques a foreign exchange college student who takes on and single handedly wipes out a mexican street gang in this obnoxious and racist film which is so horrible that its laughable bad acting bad plot and bad fight choreography make angel town a turkey
0,something does not work in this movie there are absolutely no energies between real the betwixt actors in fact pic their very acting seems frozen sometimes amateur also the script is not convincing and not reliable
1,forbidden planet is one of the examples of films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment was aimed a midfifties audience that is now gone have it quite a bit and the films pacing doesnt help but storys compelling central idea involving ancientextinct krell and monsters from id hasnt lost its and continue to make this film a relevant must see what im mostly interested in here that the dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has really looked that good on home video and its elements are in dire need restoration i hope that will happen and we get a special edition of sf
1,the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch
1,this is a very moving film that takes a to each one new twist on somewhere weve all been be active a relationship as its about to end kristen thomsons performance as tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing non and moving and takes you right into the story who hasnt been faced carrying out with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully just one more night when he does totally give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious group a every truly contribution close family relationship relationship can be and how each one be active whether keister permanent or not should be treated with respect rather daytime than simply thrown away
1,allison deans performance is what stands out in my watching this film balances out the melancholy tone of the film an iridescent energy i like to see more of her
0,i think i can safely say without really giving anything away that this movie had no robots in it the guys in robot costumes didnt act or speak as such and the evil entity behind the whole plot isnt a robot eitherthe whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set i cant even use words to describe the actingthis couldnt even offer the hilarious ending of star crystal in short it is clearly one of the worst scifi movies of the s and i would be so bold as to say of all time
0,when i saw the poster at the theater i thought that it is a new line of a horror story without a famous cast worth giving a try but after i went in i wanted to leave after minutes there was a lot of nonsense and logical flaws to me it is a movie that is not worth putting in theaters it is not even worth seeing
1,i loved this movie it was cute and lauren holly was wonderful shes funny and very believable in her role costas mandylan was also very good nice to look at too brenda vaccaro usual was a pleasure to watch she did a great with her character it was a pleasure watching a movie that is funny interesting and can be watched by the whole family its difficult to find wholesome movies anymore thank for the hallmark movies they are wonderful i wish i could buy it if knows where i could purchase this movie please let me know i have purchase several hallmark movies and am very happy with them i hope i buy this one

0,hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap reinvented over and over again take superheroes for example for each xman and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of mr gore verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman based horrors eg the ring the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudgesthe first grudge wasnt entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge the critic goes the same waytired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichs all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dullthe chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldnt enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesnt that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day its getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood bullshits
0,the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offerotherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to decommercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing
0,it does touch a few interesting points but it fails to show evidence of all the exclusive studies shown who are the friends and ismall groups of scientists that gathered this data whats up with all the al gore biography going on there like how he liked playing with the cows on the ranch or that his kid got hit by a car too bad but what does that have to do with the ozone layerive seen much better stuff in much less time on discovery channel i really dont understand why this has such a high score on imdb unless youve been living under a rock this documentary shouldnt be any news to you all this is old news and all al gore is trying to do is get some popularity points ps im not american so dont even try saying that im a bush fan p
1,ive movie twice already and very impressed with itthe conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are touching the nigerian community is shown very truthfully as colourfully as it usually isalthough certain things could have done with a bit more explanation we knew matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car be more understandableluckily optimum releasing have a website has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understandi would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a release in london and is longer available to see i hope the release gets it to bigger audience because the film deserves
1,enjoyed the movie very much certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more and there is truly a lot more historically to find outdid the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization particularly of the shooting event there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at prince alberts contribution to uk and the monarchy warrants a movie on its own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention herethe costumes and sets are especially good but am i alone in thinking that this production which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one wanted badly for a british court historical etiquette expert beyond the duchess of york ie did princess victoria really stuff an entire trufflerissole into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of his majesty with her mouth full could never really felt that sympathetic to victoriain this movie or indeed in her shoes at all yet loved the casting of the principals whose acting was convincing so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well i always felt like a totally detached uninformed outside observer much more so than with mrs brown or even the queen yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes off the screen except that is for some of the more avantgarde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time
0,tagline the lucky ones diedbefore watching thisive never watched a bulgarian movie from s so i cant say this is the worst movie ever made but it surely is the worst movie ive ever watched i cant almost remember itall i can recall is a family of stupid people who dont do anything right their car has one wheel out of four stuck in the sand so they decide that theres nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there then theres an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the whereabouts but has never considered the idea to report the fact to the policeand speaking of the policeif those freaks have lived around there eating humans for years lots of people must have disappearedhow come the sheriff didnt suspect anythingbut i gave up asking questions after the first five minutes or so the rest is bore an hallucinated unbelievable borei will be merciful and wont speak about the dialogues and the acting and the effectsi will only mention the final scene where the freak girl eliminates a snake the snakes they come out in the end what the hell do they have to do with the story with a sniperprecise throw of a stone demonstrating the full disregard of mr craven for reality and for things that happen on planet earth in generali believe there have been riots when the film was first released in even being eaten by a cannibal wouldnt be a fair punishment to the director for this attack on intelligence
0,the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it represent not visually stunning actually visually devil at times most decidedly one of those picture you find easier to finish up if you keep one finger on the debauched forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other option open at the second and you really dig seeing the fiddling poltergeist lady well maybe id recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the second
1,gary cooper and a marshal change identities since they both agree cooper would be more efficient facing the outlaws what is remarkable in this film are the costumes both the marshals and steve cochrans who is the bad guy cochran wears his guns backwards probably to be able to crossdraw the film starts quite excitingly with a showdown with wild bill hickok ruth roman looking very pretty is the marshals fiancee there is plenty of action never a dull moment but you have to concentrate because the story is a bit complicated good entertainment
1,this movie shows that the free go ahead system and the quest for the divine buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers ultimately the securities industry place determines the subject matter that is sent to the public this movie dramatizes that point a bourgeois whitecollar advertising company is taken over by a group of streetwise african american chaired by a nononsense grim man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the true statement but the movie shows that no subject how hard he tries to do something unlike the securities industry place and the political system demands that he conform rendering him no unlike than his predecessors worry offbeat movie
1,just saw baby blue marine again after years i find it pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost the innocence purity of a time now gone is truthfully captured in this the acting is above average and richard geres brief appearance as a shellshocked raider marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff gere fan janmicheal is in his prime and looks and acts like the allamerican boy the late bruno kirby who was billed as bkirby jr has a meaty role as pop a peaceloving marine corp reject dreaming of getting back home to his if youre looking for sex drugs or rock roll this movie not you if youre looking for action and adventure the same applies however if you want to recapture a in america of innocence honor romance and love then baby blue marine is a movie for
1,a heartwarming film the usual brilliant represent by toilet thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands circus tent actors certainly of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of examiner morse as jack regan in the s hit tv serial the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a mustiness see for all the family and a not bad dvd for my collection the filming will bring plunk for a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the ii main characterstom and the boy william was really well dissemble and admittedly to the book by michelle magorian
1,this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows lavishness metropolitan opera house in brilliant color other scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as for the what more can be said other than that lanzas voice was at its peak as he sang so many of worlds best and beloved arias the marvelous dorothy kirsten is a joy as her voice blends that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood took their customary liberties with story of caruso there is precious little in story line that relates to for example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and no relationship to the there are very good sites that tell the true of caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books available concerning his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of kirsten and chorus members are real stars of movie enjoy i know that i sure did
0,this movie sucked wind i imagine that the other people that gave this movie such high votes must be independent filmmakers i cant imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny or even slightly entertaining i feel like minutes of my life were just wasted
1,only the notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today but it is exactly the main characters adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic it is this notion that local anesthetic ennobles them and inscrutable totally allows them to stand out to as live vitamin a they pic refer to their respective spouses not be faithfulness like themas tony leung said in the film love just happens make believe there doesnt need to be a rational explanation as to vitamin a how it happens it simply does despite a lot their not wanting to stoop to their respective spouses level it happened fidelity social mores and timing all conspired against this wish relationship coming into pic fruition simply being in love is far from enoughi had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple still in university from the snippets of rational number conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film time and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities their gross vitamin a inability to digest the subtleness and the deeper emotions evoked made me realize just how much a film such as this as well go on as other wong kar weis work educe is wasted on the local audience
1,ive seen a few movies in my time but this one exceptional youll have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it it is emotionally complex it explores and passion at its most extreme and its is just breathtaking the character of the is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice indeed leave his bed the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted the film has a sort of mathematical and perfection to it which is rare these days it combines action love tragedy drama and politics all in this is unmissable all the hype surrounding it and all the awards cannot begin to do it any justice hats to ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which it is based
0,this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying its quite obvious why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated rerunsmost of its plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the producers didnt have an original idea in their heads i havent commented enough youve got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad for a showthe gnome was a nice character
1,my favorite jackie chan movie will always be drunken master followed by this film from police story in it chan plays a hong kong supercop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang and is then assigned to protect the mans girlfriend brigitte lin so that she can turn states evidence as the story goes on the gangster sends his goons to dispatch lin but chan takes matters into his own fists and feet while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay like drunken master police story has many of the signature stunts and overthetop martial artsaction choreography that chan has become famous for climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall in his role as director chan exceeds in excellence giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action while light on the overall slapstick humor of drunken master at heart police story is just that a police story a gritty copthriller that would be oftcopied over the years to come
1,three american lads are backpacking their way around europe challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they can but andy seeks true love he finds this during their bungeejump attempt on the eiffel tower when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heartburstingly beautiful julie delpy his attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action romance gore and inspired humor without ever taking itself to seriously or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining minute ride i have seen this film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the london original although both films are so different it is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel
1,i enjoyed this motion picture more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locating to make it worth your while while i cant quite so far see mark wahlberg as a leader hes stupefy ripe enough to be a credible manager and thats okthe superhero of the motion picture is the miniskirt cooper its shown to have the speed dexterity and muscle to pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver like charlize therons eccentric
0,mr kennedy should stop experimenting bad movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed hey ive got an idea lets make a sequel stage of inception if there was zero rating id it but i ill settle for a generous it seems these days that if there is buck to be made movie execs will dig an old hit and run it a set of writers and see what up hey i said hit and run kinda describes how felt when this movie how this piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me it is filled unpleasant humor strange and jokes that dont quite take you anywhere besides state of confusion if you are being dragged to this movie and someone is paying for youfine but still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead however if youre planning on paying your own hardearned money search out a better alternative

0,sorry to toilsome go against the flow but i thought toilsome this film was unrealistic boring and way too long i got tired of watching gena rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an guess important step for the director set out birth but for pure entertainment value i wish live i would have skipped it
0,this movie is really stupid and very boring most of the time there are almost no ghoulies in it at all there is nothing good about this movie on any level just more bad actors pathetically attempting to make a movie so they can get enough money to eat avoid at all costs
0,i cant think of much to say about this film this was an awful moviei cant even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i dont even know where to beginthe plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done by the end of the movie i found myself feeling beyond relieved the editing was poor the acting was subpar and the storyline was weak francoise robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage if a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at the very least it wasnt it was just pathetic
1,life begins and ends in a typical s maternity recovery ward where we view hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women played by loretta young glenda farrell clara blandick aunty em vivienne osborne dorothy tree and gloria shea as they await to give birth while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in was like for our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers i found the film fascinating and exceptionally movingoddly enough the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member young eric linden as jed sutton graces loretta young husband what an actor as a first time father jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table i felt his every concern keenly id like to see more of this actors work he had a very emotional voice which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia who screamed dont cut dont cut as scarlett fled the hospital in horror chilling another great performance is from aline macmahon who plays miss bowers the nurse her character is a salt of the earth type the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical professionloretta young did another superb acting job here as well a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace my she is great in these precodes ive really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few monthsglenda farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste didnt anyone know back in that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies health but her character redeems herself in the endalso in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland silent movie star as a grieving italian husband his screen time was brief but notablelife begins is a mustsee precode try to catch it sometime on tcm but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into out of
0,overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow up to the basic storyline the role of maria schrader searching for families secret past take to forever there is really no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by katja riemann the entire of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between day new york berlin and berlin s please when you do that give the audience an what time exactly the takes place there is never a clear indication of time very annoying worst part is the end spoilers entire show and about the jews being so terribly simply by a bureaucratic accident give me a break thats how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who freed the jews is never answered was is who freed them did lean fischer sleep with goebels venice the film won acting award for k riemann why i no idea be the jewish theme
0,smithereens is the variety of worthless flick which just string up out among the cable channels taking up space like a crummy dime new in the public library a worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director seidelman the film is fraught with bad acting bad sound bad camera work and poor choice in all aspects of the film many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this do and never seem to go out is of lifes great enigma d
0,the first episode set the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hitman who is contracted to kill a toymaker we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business but he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
1,after a big tip of the hat to spinal tap this movie is hilarious anyone who grew up watching mtv will love it and if you didnt rent it anywaythe my peanuts and a gangsters life videos are worth the three bucks alone
1,has there ever been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each others lives the center of it is the romance of james stewart and margaret sullavan who work together and cant get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including youve got mail the recent update of shop theyre not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitschs rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the neartragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of
1,recently released on british dvd this is a good movie as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly not as depressing as it could have been this is kitchensink at its most dirty terrance stamp is great in it the music is sweet carol white is very believeable as the single mum tart who cant stop loving criminalsmy favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk pastthe only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carols first husband but if you can get past that youre ok and donovan provides some of the most languid mellow bittersweet lyrics to come out of the s
0,a movie has rarely left me as cold as this one there is not a bit of tension not a second of fear not a moment we jump even a little bit the girl is cute yeah thats it was that worth a movie i knew it wasnt supposed to be a great movie but i was at least expecting one

1,in a little town in montana two brothers grow up one of them is norman craig sheffer the other is paul brad pitt their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion and the lessons of flyfishing in this movie flyfishing represents life a littlethe story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message some things do happen though norman goes to dartmouth to study after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie emily lloyd and he is invited to teach in chicago paul has become a reporter and is known as the fishing reporter he is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles too muchthe movie is very well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography the mountains the woods and the river all look very beautiful if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch fortunately there is more
0,other than some neat especial effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to essay and lay down it interesting but with no success kevin bacons acting was pretty good but he couldnt salvage the movies deficiency of plot
1,ive been waiting years for the dead to come out on video having pretty much worn my vhs copy to shreds this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays it takes place on the feast of the epiphany twelfth night and is a simple poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three dublin women central to the story is a fairly loveless couple a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife but feels incapable all of the performances are stunning and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully of course its source material is james joyces short story of the same title and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact john hustons long career as one of hollywoods greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film which was scripted by his son tony huston stars his daughter anjelica huston and is dedicated to his wife maricella thank you to lions gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a literate subtle yet incredibly moving holiday film this is a true gem
0,i cant quite say that jerry springerringmaster is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film ive ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me to hate it my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only minutes had passed it had seemed much more like years it is an endless repetition of poor people or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing the plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to them it never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom maybe im not supposed to care about them maybe im supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny too bad it isnt the humor is not outrageous its innocuous its predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function scatology is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughters boyfriend since i was over the shock of jerry springers show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clays obscene nursery rhymes not laughter just yawning lastly i found springers pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing if he really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a single mom from bedsty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on a year or failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for his shows his movie his book and videos his guests just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves if he liked poor people so much hed give them at least some of the money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself jeez with all his fine work youd think hed have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesnt even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that
1,fun movie only great for the kids they found it very hold entertaining somewhat predictable but there are a few surprises great movie to watch if youre looking for something graeco roman just to entertain dont expect to be seeing a classic

0,you know a movie will not go comfortably when john carradine narrates aka reads the script plot synopsis over his fictitious character funeral procession a mere minutes into the movie the narration is his fictitious character last will testament it stipulate that his estate be divided amongst his children and servants the children shall split million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants to be eligible they must live in the kinsperson estate for a workweek it sounds like the typical plot of a world showthere is minuscule subtext as to the nature of the doyen they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional kinsperson but the real trouble starts with the overwhelm of that dog from the orifice voiceover by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian ct and mouse game with a twist finish that journey is painfully retard and pointless we trudge through minutes of view the great unwashed sitting round playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through the fish bowl scene dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men unvarying bickering misplaced circus music eccentric flashbacks reminiscent of fauxgerman expressionism the horror aesthetic of the thursday range and heaps of dramatic overacting this all inevitably leads to the expected ungratifying finish you will be happy to distillery be live but the pain in the neck might be too great to bear alone share children sharecelluloid rehab

0,despite the solid performance of penelope ann miller this movie was an awkward mess the lead characters american accent was ridiculous and he never seemed comfortable as a result there was no chemistry between the two actors and im still not sure what annmargaret was doing there
1,this changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about custer the music of max steiner is magnificent also all the film the song gerry owen was a favourite of custer is played the should have more villains because they try to concentrate the bad guys in arthur kennedy relationship between flynn and havilland flows like in no other off their films together director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best

0,this film was basically set up for failure by the studio one anne rice author of the book offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio two they tried to stuff in depth novels in to a hour moviei maintain the only way for these two books vampire lestat and queen of the damned to work in a live action form would be through a miniseries first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place from the s to the s and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character lestat the entire book vampire lestat sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyedlestat was not cruel and vicious to all he was not wanting to go along with akashas plans marius did not make lestat lestat did not love jesse or make her lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light marius was not after david nor the other way around every character was completely represented wrong basically same names different storyif they wanted to make a vampire movie fine even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels fine but dont piggie back into the theaters off the success of rices great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to loveif you havent read the books you wont understand the film really if you have read the books you will be insulted that being said i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it catch must see it will hate it
0,the complaints are to me the biggest problem this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay night time soaps like greys anatomy ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting with the given that they will never end however when the idea daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim and lowell into sexual tension and romps and ridiculous difficult situations socalled little it seems like general hospitalor a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea this is a high brow show or something men will is unrealistic
0,look hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director lilliputian then they totally have not seen this movie i mean there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast shoddy special effects i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio pic a high school drama club could probably lodge come out with a agent better product i mean they had erika eleniak who is unsound gorgeous casper van dien and under rated birth actor their agents should be shot to ask them to sign tight on to atomic number this dribble dont they read scripts i still cant believe understand that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at tight why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last man standing i am a fan of vampire movies and intersection this is by non far the worst they should stake it tight so that it clock time never sees the light of day
1,my definition of a great movie is if you want to continue to see it over again this movie for some reason strikes a cord in me even though the scenes with scott glenn still make me winch i watch it over and over again and love the music
0,talk about rubbish i cant think of one good thing in this movie the horrendous screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well group a there were no effects i cant believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finishthe live front cover of photograph the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth wish and atomic number scary eyes i looks like a atomic number scary villain but like the old saying never judge ordinary bicycle a book by its cover the whole villain looked like a verbalize cardboard cut group a out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in lapland but no a tropical island insteadi took this movie as a evaluator spoof which i think tatty they ordinary bicycle atomic number wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you pine tree state can argue that i havent watched the first one pic but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldnt attempted itthe biggest joke in this movie is the effects stinger the snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was baddie a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the book binding budget of this matter movie would of probably be between to pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of state grabbed the actors for the street atomic number gave them the script told them they have minutes to practise these lines and shoot work on a islandlastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their instant ordinary lines and burlesque made them bad up the way throughin conclusion i give this film uncollectible stars out of
