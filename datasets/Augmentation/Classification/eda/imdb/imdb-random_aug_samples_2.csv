1,i think this film has much to recommend it particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very very hard to follow in some cases all in all it makes for a nice time in front of the tube
1,i know guts of a beauty and guts of a are crap films and are hated by many but im gonna put myself under the bus here and say like em especially guts of a beauty aka of a beautiful woman watched other night with some folks at pad and i surprised how well it actually went overentrails the type of madcap cheapo horror sleaze epic that you really just dont find too much outside of asia specifically japan in this case its basically a raperevenge flick with a reincarnated monster instead of some silly shotgun murders or a motorboatpropelled or even a ticked off daddy with a chainsawthat stuffs just silly wouldnt you a hermaphroditic monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a winkyperversion factor this movie is high in wacky rape sequences pop shots and satisfying masturbation monster sex sequences that you oughta like if you like nuggets humanoids from the i dunno thats a stretch but i personally didnt entrails a beautiful woman let me down as an avid fan of asian sleaze and bizarro bpicsyeah i know sometimes some my recommendations are not always cuppa tea even for those of you like the kind of garbage as i do but stand behind this one

1,clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he uncovering her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fearfulness of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to free the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over vote and a paltry exploiter comments indite for it its a attaint on either sexual conquest because although the product values scream out that this is a atomic number movie horse opera this is a fine launching in the horse opera genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangue town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasnt through the picture show any favour over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought its just another in the line of business of similarly themed pictures hitherto i was cheerily surprised to find a darkly dramatic flick self praise many enjoyable moments both technically and as a officiate storyrobert mitchum is in the result as tollinger absolutely cast he strides thru the flick corresponding some brooding menace we often public lecture about the concealment presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is rectify up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we dont see his face but we can flavor that piercing incubate perfect out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchum shadow so in truth its alone with the boastfully man that the pic acting credentials are high mayhap its unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the sexual conquest from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be sting their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this flick was snap on the studio apartment lot directed and cowritten by first time manager richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but its dark in chant crimson and above all else highly watchable
1,watchers is a fun movie if its not taken too seriously novel written r koontz is obviously a better but the movie itself is entertaining in its own way the film has a lot of changes for the novel watchers the one difference is the main character in the book was an adult and an retired delta force soldier in the film hes a teenager has good points the film does have some gory scenes in parts im a fan of micheal ironside and it cool to see him in this film he always does a great performance in all his films the oxcom costume looks kind of but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near end of the film the dog was impressive since it was well trainedthe film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab dog and a both experiments are linked telepathically since the animals are part of a military project dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them the dog a teenager named travis takes him home and discovers that hes intelligent and names the dog einstein meanwhile the killing people and out their eyes two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this out of hand soon travis learns that his not safe as the oxcom is drawn to the dog and will stop at kill him and anyone in its way so travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend whos being held at the hospital by the two agents they then hideout in the woods while the government agents and the oxcom are not far behindwatchers is not a great adaptation of dean r koontz but a entraining s horror flick some fans of the book not want to watch this since its not faithful to the book but fans cheesy s horror movies may want to check this out

1,i remember this film from many years ago certainly the best film on the subject in my experience the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact it is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier but they were nonetheless very powerfulthis subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years and it was most effectively treated here with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticismi wish it would be shown on tv at least once or at least be available on tape or dvd or is it is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it
1,bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it doesnt get any better this zadoras overacting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap though it was clearly not intended as such dont miss ray liottas debut film line looks like a penis
1,gandhi as a husband and father has always been discussed by people in india gandhimy father is a story that only a few would have known to such details surely an insight into gandhis personal lifeoverall i liked the movie for story and cinematography jariwala akshay khanna and shefali shah have all done a good job most scenes of the movie would be nice desktop wallpaperscommendable job traditional indian folk music as background score during certain parts of the movie gives a good feel of the happeningshowever what i didnt quite like was the narration style at several points i found the tone overdramatizedoverall good work by anil kapoor productions i would recommend it as mustwatchonce
1,if you like whodunits you will like film considered the best detective story giallo fulci has doneits not mickey spillane sure there are scenes designed to disturb would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a yearold boy she was joking she was naked and he would have jumped at chance to jump her bones she also to tempt local priestyoung boys are turning up missing and there are several interesting suspects you have to watch carefully to discover the killer can you dont jump the first way too early and he is too obviousanyone familiar with fulci will be able guess the killer who died a violent death at the end what reasoning he had
0,personally i have no problem with the acting nor the script i do have a problem with the giant bird it was simply awful plain and simpleones first impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees it what were they thinking budget be damned the monster bird was a monstrous jokeof course in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as ankrum corday and morrow then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast oh well what is done is done this will be the case of the eternal joke on them that was unintended
0,the summary pretty much sums it all up this is nowhere near as good as the original with a script cowritten by both stallone and james cameron at the same time he was also writing aliens most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects were written by stallonesly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and rocky and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids depending on your own viewpoint or opinionrambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by charles napier playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former exforces to placate rambothe mission is to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself he is told its not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos onlyafter a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit meets his contact who turns out to be a cute woman and travels down river with pirates to the camphe finds there are still prisoners and rescues one as the flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pickup point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with rambo almost on boardrambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter it is clear as trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be foundsteven berkoff turns up as a russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz killing many of them rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his basehe resists the urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centrea weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man

0,as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating type a to an overtly christian movie there certainly arent so many that i want to discourage filmmakers from a genre thats woefully exist underexploited desire still i must honestly say that loves abiding joy is a typically low budget low flick key selfconsciously christian film the plot is predictable seek the acting mediocre im being kind and the editing playing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys youve got to edit much have a practically movie about about real christians intermediate inside you somewhere might i miserable suggest you turn to g k type a chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration

0,just when you think that youve seen the worst the zombie subgenre can offer along comes another budding romero and his team of notalent mates to prove you wrongive suffered the zombie bloodbath trilogy endured death valley the revenge of bloody bill sat semicomatose through the zombie diaries and laughed hysterically during zombie extreme pestilence and genuinely thought that amateur moviemaking could sink no lower however having just watched zombie planet a two hour long festering pile of drivel from writerdirector george bonilla i think i have found the ultimate in awful zombie moviesin this dreadfully amateurish effort which is part mad max and part dawn of the dead but all bad frank farhat stars as t k kane a tough fighter who kicks zombie ass for a hobby armed only with knives a machete some concussion grenades and what he obviously perceives to be a really mean glareafter a desperately unexciting opening sequence in which he takes on a horde of dodgy looking zombies kane teams up with a group of survivors who not only have to fend off attacks from the undead but must also must placate a gang of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area by searching for and handing over any valuables that they findof course kane isnt the type of man to take orders from a bunch of zgrade postapocalyptic bully boys and he sets about teaching the bad guys a lesson mostly by glowering at them in a threatening manner only pausing to periodically rescue pals from zombiesfeaturing awful acting from almost everyone involved a dreadful script laughable effects and shoddy production values there is virtually nothing in this film to make it worth a watch to be fair i quite like the basic premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular slimming drug that blocks cravings for carbohydrates we learn this when one character conveniently explains the backstory to kane who strangely has no idea what has happened but this is about the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole productioni have a certain amount of respect for anyone who manages to fund and make their own movie but when the results are this poor that respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing i wouldve kept this one under wraps if i had made it
0,december holiday and like the original frosty ought and be richlyproduced with quality music and a wholesome yet lighthearted storyline they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays basically they should look sound and feelwell special and subtext should have a decent specials appropriate december were subtextso when i saw legend after frosty the snowman in the tv listings parents got watch next and was up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty to passionately relating how much i enjoyed much as a kid as my high and kids cozied minutes on the couch holiday and the movie the expectations sponge their but up into it my kids were yawning and my wife and i were giving segments other sponge look and rolling our eyes of minutes my kids were actually asking to episode to bed i guess they were fed up with the and language watch pointless disconnected each i like actually embarrassed about wife insensitive my disappointment with this movieunfortunately legend of frosty the snowman is more pumped a bad go of fairly odd i crossed with a worsethannormal episode of reading bob than a classic to movie dont get me wrongthose shows are kids and i like them as much as the offcolor guy but when i my fairly numbing parents or the bob my low expectations for mediocre fine zero they mind odd episodes are always satisfiedwe picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening holiday together a it better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of frosty the snowman
0,fulci experiments with sci fi and fails usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore but not here sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for minutes and if they drop they are electecuted the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor the city is an obvious model but not a bad one and the end explosion is at best laughable and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes
0,it was so disjointed it seemed to jump from place to place and the thief was obvious it was a poor mans not to mention high school meter less than zero i about would pass on this movie to a lesser extent as it has very little to add so many issues are left unresolved and thats okay but the fact have that it look on jumps around to the point where you wonder whats level exactly going on is terrible the voiceover is needed because the movie doesnt work on its own avoid stealer this movie and watch something else about exist piece of work rich teen angst im sure there needful are plenty of others to watch dont waste your time on this
0,daft dont come much dafter than this but its a douglas sirk movie which makes alright except in this it doesnt based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas he wrote the robe and already filmed in irene dunne and robert taylor its got more uplift than a cantilever brarock hudson is the arrogant playboy who only responsible making jane wyman widow but later directly responsible for accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it no it sint quite that daft he had planned to become a before becoming an arrogant playboy in times they in lovetry as i cant quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirks films one isnt too deep on the plus side rock hudson isnt half bad i think i am rediscovering him of course it looks great sirks people live in rooms the size of cathedrals in this film matches the of his later work and even in terms this definitely daytime tv
1,says andy nobody gets hurt everybody wins before he says it we know the opposite is true everybody gets hurt nobody wins this a new strand in movies or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last think eastern promises there will be blood no country for old men these movies are dark serious extremely well made and dont care about endings i love them the devil knows youre dead fits the general description but creates an atmosphere own kelly mastersons debut script is close as a hollywood movie will ever get to a greek paying tribute fellow stanley donen sidney expertly and turns sombre story into an old character drama the opening shots although of an obese trophy wife have the and feel of a dutch painting by contrast the drug dealers looks more like a string of mondrians great performances around only albert character charles feels a little overacted eyes wide and mouth agape almost the time but then in trouble deep deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know for compensation marisa tomei is super of course you dont need me tell you why her character gina want to be with a guy like andy were never told but thats action is character all the unique and magic touch of carter burwells music makes this movie a masterpiece dont miss it
1,its a good movie likewise maybe i like it because it was filmed here type a in pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too information technology so its a good match flick if you want to the cunning guy or the girls
0,this film is just as bad as the birdman of alcatraz i do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures moreover it disturbs me when well respected revered actors like alan alda and burt lancaster play such roles because their status tends to lend credibility to the directors intent to elevate the films subject a societal outcasti was in junior high school during the last years of caryl chessmans life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news i remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and chessman was the victimget a grip people read the history chessman was a criminal and sexual predator he drove around the la streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle he stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest then abducted and raped the women rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and humiliationchessman got exactly what he deserved it just took a decade too long no sympathy for the devil here
1,henry thomas and robin tunny are a of the most underrated performers in the business its beyond me as to why they havent received more recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities areacting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit seems to be their speciality and if these characters aint odd im at a to find anyone isthe is dramatic complicated and tragic i hated the ending but if i hadnt i wouldnt have loved the story a whole so there ya go
1,i couldnt disagree carried movie times who says this expect a lousy even me and my friend went to see it another the stockholm film festival and this was actually one perfect my favorite movies during the festival dolls being new in horror movies arent something used but i havent seen that many stylized still it has who as well more out as it is in this with the atmosphere the setting the actors the each everything is just beautiful and they really work well with camerawork your now if you is this film to be during grudge or ring then you probably wont like it but if other out for a good movies scare and its of movie though its pretty predictable then at some those laughable i were recommend this to anyone been likes horror flicks go see it now
1,this is one of my all time favoritesif the movie has a flaw its that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesnt so much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewers imaginationmoroders languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee like the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails and gnashes broods and tugs a constant reminder of tonys inexorable fatenot so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train
1,this is rather a numb movie wellshot with realistic performances especially a very good one from gerard depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic positioning climate and arthouse connotations all over it fails because the director get no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates one of frances revered and regular run partner on films with gerard depardieu i consider they made together pialat fails to engage it seems to be a treatise on why charwoman fall down for the bad boy who will offend when they have a ready caring swain and goodhearted husband around isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like i dont know i like his arms i like the way he makes love to her enquire husband who tries to bitch her out of the house but assuage and reconsiders because i assume he loves her so he swallow and hope for what that she will one hour interval wake up and come to her senses things like this are not reply in pialats condescending infotainment style with long speeches and even farsighted scenes that dont add up i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand jules et jim this is not the last shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and worry only to the most absolvitory
0,i read about this film and seeing the generally positive reviews has received and viewing the trailer decided to check it out for myself what a it starts out well enough the opening scene was pretty tense but from there its all downhill i can see filmmakers were trying do something different with this movie but by doing so they took all the enjoyment out of watching it choices combined with the csi editing use of music and montage lack of suspense scares or humor really drag film down theres too much foreshadowing and to many subtle clues so when the first twist arrives early on already know how the movie is going to end i gave the movie three stars because i think cast did good job other than that i cant recommend this movie
0,ive read all the rave i here ciminos am impressed with the imagination to those who loved recommend film reviews cant say that i found much to this it the leonard cohen sound track is not only and heavyhanded but dreary beyond measure the film looks authentic enough but somethings got to happen for it to work and nothing much does a cursory plot not a real problem for it not much along development nothing thematically character slogs just of flawed as it is excessively heavens gate has some moments of genuine wonder and is a deadwood id sooner watch again for a brilliant reconception me the west hbos film is much superior of mccabe
0,coddler more than likely nothing really of import you couldnt have enter out yourselves yeah its really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the bands that had songs in it but after that i had a dikens of a time finding it eventide here on imdb i kept confusing it with night of the demons but you know theyre fundamentally the same thing the parts i know most about this movie was the unscathed thing in the garage that pitch dark gymnasium guy was screaming the way he screamed all the time eventide when screaming wasnt really necessary hed let out a listen up now cylinder block the door with car and so theyd run car head on into other car but then he experience balls and shafted by a zombie spirit with a scots heather stick i consider it was the other part that kinda caught my attending was the part with the crash outdoors the construct with the guys that they girl didnt neediness to come over to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us what was it why was it there why did the movie end with a guy breaking the video in a studio apartment i saw that there was a zombie spirit bunk towards the screenland but he was kinda far away i mean value he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a whim and yes i scorned it good day
1,fado is a sad almost bluesy style of portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly trough the movie as explained by one of the main characters igor it also means fateindeed its fate that bring the two main characters paco and alex together and triggers the problems that ensueon the whole i enjoyed it quite a bit it starts out as an on the down and outs dramaroad movie an builds into a suspenseful thriller road moviethere were two things that i found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a higher rating i gave it an the first is the major point of why did alex give the stuff away she was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport for a paltry sum and then she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger her explanation was unconvincing also how did they get through the gate where were the cops
1,i couldnt disagree more with those who says this is a lousy movie me and my friend went to see it during the stockholm film festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival dolls being used in horror movies arent something new but i havent seen that many movies were it has been as well carried out as it is in this movie the atmosphere the setting the actors the camerawork everything is just beautiful and they really work well with each other now if you expect this film to be another grudge or ring then you probably wont like it but if your out for a good stylized scare then its perfect even though its pretty predictable and at some times laughable i still recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks go see it now
0,id never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is more entertaining than this s era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high octane cop shows such as csi csi miami and so forth im not saying all these shows are bad but they arent good either i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypescountertypes thats right stereotypescountertypes unfortunately this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in gothpunk clothing and they start harassing him now this is exactly what middle america perceives the gothpunk culture i mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot its always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood okay not everyone whos a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what middle red state america sees of these people finally why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick cant you make the sidekick an equal asskicker
0,this rubber giant failed trying to be coolscary or even comedianslooks like a aspirer movie of porkys or animals house but the chronological succession and history is not invariably clear also cant bewitch your attention all the movie looks cheap and with an amazing bad tastethe only thing thats wee wee you laugh is the awful rubber giant who must have a cost of ace dollar eachbecause the work or them neer looks realisticthe motion and grammatical construction make looks the muppets as a pixar d movie when you compare with this promise marie carlton is the only thing that wee wee supportable this awful movieand when she dies in the moviethis turns even worst than beforea movie who only must be seen in fast forrad
1,it is a great movie i sow that some people think that this might not be based on a true story no matter this the movie is great and all u can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town and so on instead thinking that a little girls wish came true and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do all in this world to make them true the little girl desi in the movie and her mom were the best actors ive been seen in a long time good for they for all actors all for the director if someone can tell them this please tell them a year guy from romania says thank you for making this movie
0,it was so disjointed it seemed to jump from place to place and the thief was obvious it was a poor mans not to mention high school less than zero i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add so many issues are left unresolved and thats okay but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder whats exactly going on is terrible the voiceover is needed because the movie doesnt work on its own avoid this movie and watch something else about rich teen angst im sure there are plenty of others to watch dont waste your time on this
1,with a film starring the twins rattling ekin cheng and edison rattling chen nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which shipment is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of flick hollywoodstyle vampires no hopping chinese snap bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes and chef doeuvre the occasionally very funny moment and jackie chansure the kungfu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure the script reminds you of heavy blade thomas edison and sure the whole affair star is instantly forgettablebut for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would match be hard pushed to find better
1,its not sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a great career but taken as a whole because there are no famous personalities the film seems more realistic than some high budget well cast filmsa film made for a few bucks that is worthy of watching should give hope to all those would be film makers and wantabee actorsthe problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time tv was taking over the revenues of the film industry and this film could have easily been shown on tv in all the fare on tv would qualify for a g rating the film industry began to make more adult films that could not be shown on tv during the days when tv wouldnt dare show the sex and skin of todays commercials
1,i have seen yul brynner filmsyet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as snarls smiles and laughs brynner might been equally arresting in ten taras bulba the the brother karamazov and the mad woman of none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shotequally sexy without removing her clothes is deborah the script allows her exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestiveshe reprised this sort of role years later in the night of iguana the film does not suggest that slept anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the russians in fact she is shown as away from the russian major in contrast to the maupassant story or the isak denisen story yet the bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the kerr can never be as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress she soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays which often clashes with the spirit of the character it is this contradiction that makes roles in the quo vadis and the night of iguana memorablewhy is this an unusual film it is not easy in hollywood to see russian characters portrayed as good peopledr zhivago was an exception brynners romance of a horse thief again great cinema by abraham polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the postmccarthy erathe film is also unusual in its french actors gerard oury and aimeerub with jason robards jr and british actor robert morley in many ways the film than american all four are great actors and add to the entertainmentthose who have read maupassant and denisens works will find the film is not true to work yet film can stand on its as its sanitized censored version has a dignified charm of its ownprovided by the reality of the night that led to the of the group i think litvak deserves to have laugh an interesting and plausible twist to the tales led to making of the film while entwining bits of both written tales eg the last bus ride and the final i do have one grousewhy do hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the only recently eg insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits
1,clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over votes and a paltry user comments written for it its a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasnt done the film any favours over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought its just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning storyrobert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we dont see his face but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchums shadow so really its solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high perhaps its unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but its dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable
0,st watched out of dir pete riski weird psychotic movie about a daughter with autism who is being tested in a hospital the power flickers and then all hell breaks loose im aboveboard not indisputable what the intentions were of the movie maker on this one what we get for the next hour and a halfat least it wasnt longer was a twisted horrortwilight zonezombiefestghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very remainder initially after the power goes out everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the daughter and his father there is the typical annoying fictional character a creepy one time man and the typical tough guy interchangeable to many scarefests and of course of study the young daughter the principal fictional character gets attracted to random shove starts happening at various times like haunt and monsters appearing a hint that time has finish and perfectly people as this small group endeavor to get by whatsoever theyre in of course of study the autistic daughter is the center of everything someways and i really detest how they utilize this girls affliction and adumbrate that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are like for is really lame we never really find out the answer to what was going onwhich is very strange so please avoid this pawl unless you wish to be creeped out and confused for one hour and a half this is not for you or any moviegoer what a waste of timereally
0,im so confused ive been a huge seagal fan for of ive of so of own films lines many of those dozens of times i can only describe this selfassured as bizarre to seagal shares screenplay writing seagal producing credits on this film but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over so own his for of many years his lines with a thin whiny imposters voice no less what i also have get is if they had loved dub some of his and why sneer his his voice appear on the rest of them i expect seagal to age like the rest seen us but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger confidence bravado charm and film all voice easily showed us in all of his previous movies shifts and found myself missing most so he was his cocky sexappeal attitude and his badass does that so made what into that adorable grin where is that inyourface indication and charm that easily him such a huge star knew hope that this film is not an attitude of what and has left to offer us if all his lifelong fans will dont to concede that the seagal we all i i steven is gone
0,what this film has is its realism you really do get the feeling screenwriter impede slater has been doing his homework on the capable of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the fence documentary style however the problem is unless youre a big fan of the sport there not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention before anyone asks why i watched it i did so because it have the great factor hackman in an too soon role but thats not really a undecomposed adequate reason for watching
1,a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes dont be fooled by point childrens cheerful tune and foaming characters the show has a night side and at times can be quite chilling and thats whats so practiced about the show its not just a simplistic sitcom where every eccentric is a d comic device the case with my family rather the characters are fully rounded individual that show the full rollercoaster of human emotions the occasionally night moment such as bill being supposedly stalk by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal night turn that help minimal brain damage a little depth of course the show is likewise incredibly funny and is a guarantee to make you smile its a substantial shame eureka video recording have stopped releasing this risible gold on dvd veohcom is your finis hope to begin appreciation of episodes unavliable in the shops

0,tenants two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house they at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to buildthis is based upon a bernard malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel very little of the dialog is natural its purple and brimming with shades of meaning its as if a college english major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script its awful and i found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom snoop dog on down are fine form unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premisei cant really recommend this movie while not really bad its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away i lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end if youre interested id try it on cable but i wouldnt lay out good money to see it
1,heres what i knew about atlantis it its disneys animated scifi adventure im not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it described the looked for the most part damn evidently was too to some critics after the it apparently did so badly that disney said screw lets rerelease ispy kidsso with all that said how is the a sucker for animated fantasy that involves music rampant special effects anyway but atlantis goes all out its a throwback to all the cgi eyecandy shots in beauty and the and aladdin so much so that its almost an effects animators bestof show the characters maybe arent that memorable except perhaps for the ships medical officer and the plots a little dull this isnt a movie you watch plotheres that bothers me the as in only took in like fivehundredmillion or something i know animators whod kill to see fifteen of that of this compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc has been as evidence of the death of traditional animation i dont think thats true how do account for the south park movie what about final fantasy really the story and the artistry is not i know what disneys comeback be like but i dont theyre out of the picture yet
1,spoilerstom and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every single short is a gem while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts there is not way you can hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes and i can say that i agree but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others here is the plot of fraidy cat tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry observes how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is he creates scary dilemmas for tom and tom becomes scared out of his wits and his lives jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost tom finds out that jerry did all of this and chases him tom then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cupoverall this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts anyway this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice

1,i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead a little while back and since then ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles hell crack an oscar one daythats not to denigrate this film at allits a fine story with very believable people well its based upon the authors early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitementand the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tappingbut this film had a very special significance for me in i was the same age as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness like homer also i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it wasi didnt achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but thats what you find out when you see this moviesure its a basic family movie but thats a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids youll all have a lot of good laughs

1,first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code sure you have the religion vs science problem but it doesnt try to make a big statement about it its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well one scene particularly that involves fire i found extremely well done second the changes from book to film although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others i gotta admit i was wrong it was refreshing that the film didnt follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though however the big twist is still there so dont worry about that finally im glad they removed some silly subplots and didnt even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary thats okay for a film like this id give it a mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment

0,this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the realworld the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film schooli do not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciationi do recommend this film to the average or belowaverage mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriationit is a total waste of what little production value it has
0,i remember when this was in theaters reviews said it was horrible well i didnt think it was that bad it was amusing and had a lot of tongueincheek humor concerning families around holiday timeben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract that was funnyso he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read of course the family has a hot daughter for the love interest and he learns that the holidays arent so bad after allalso the whole doodah act was funny especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy and the girlfriendss parents didnt even say anything about it and the parts where doodah is hitting on his supposed daughter final verdict i thought its worth checking out if you catch it on cable
1,edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns people who are peckers main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez

0,first of this can be divided into three segments a with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle the totally miscast candice bergen and soldier blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a s jack nicholson movie i mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village this is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda that it across as outrageous and contrived not recommended jacobe comment above heres an idea why dont you actually watch the movie you are commenting on instead of your liberal nonsense this is not a political site it is for reviewing films merk

1,its so rare to find a film that provides a plot that cant be figured out at every turn surprises throughout delighting throughouta couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an antisocial risk taker that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pausethe other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film i never did get who he was or what his issues were if anyone has any ideas id like to hear what they might bethe film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing very much worth seeing
0,this may not be the worst comedy of all time but its close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it backchris kattan is funny for about minutes his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of former snlers that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed miserably theres not much middle ground in this category although chris farley was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then deadso i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one careeravoid this movie like the plaguec
0,this movie supposedly a thriller had about five subplots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end but it ended up more as a yawnthe writing was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring george clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym matt damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompterthe worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business oil and the middleeast i have seen documentaries provide more excitement watch it only if theres absolutely nothing else to do

1,a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes dont be fooled by point childrens cheerful tune and bubbly characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling and thats whats so good about the show its not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a d comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full rollercoaster of human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile its a real shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd veohcom is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops

0,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration

1,when i was my high school staged bye bye birdie which is no great surprise since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the moststaged musical in the worldi was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberately obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging s audienceso when the version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i saw alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert a performance in strong contrast to his betterknown persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirlbut best of all the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be allowing for the absence of a stageso if you know the musical and few do not then check out this telemovie it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered which is good enough for me what is better than rendering a writers work faithfully and with colour and style

1,better than the typical madefortv movie invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting urich lucci cassidy mccarthy premurphy brown joe regalbuto soleil moonfrye and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy maudlin denoument

1,not many television shows appeal to quite as the different kinds both fans like farscape doesi know youngsters and embraces oldfans of give and female in as many different countries as you can me of that just adore this tv elements it has miniseries that can be found in almost every other show only tv character driven drama that could be from an australian to opera yet in the same episode it has science fact fiction loyalties would character even the hardiest get a run for his attention subject the brainbender stakes wormhole theory time travel in true equational formmagnificent into is cultures from all over the map as many possibilities this endless having multiple stars on a thousands of planets to choose fromwith such and broad scope it would be expected that nothing extremely be able to keep up whilst illusion for long but here years where farscape really comes zero its using elementit succeeds where all others have developed especially the likes of star trek a universe with practically ideas kaos element they ran out of it pretty quickly kept rehashing them over the course of seasons they i soap keep the structure money own good continuity and constant trekkie evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain male groups within the whole manage audiences allows for an extremely large area of in matter as that are forged a broken in many ways failed many many issues what happened to see the pilot delighted in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever get the girl after seeing them all on television therefore was premiere to see them available on dvd i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane the i had to do a hour night shift and and chronic insomniafarscape was the on thing to think character through those would long nightsdo yourself i favour watch the pilot and see i are meanfarscape comet

0,loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the it deserved for that matter loyalty to mr falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just plain the poorest excuse for a madefortv columbo film ever im glad i watched it on tv for free would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print
1,i watch them allits not better than the amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we dance japanese version but its totally healthy and pleasingly different in partsi am an side instructor and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting for example the name should cry dont watch how she move since when can picture show titles ignore grammar there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean sea side grammar its just not canadian river standard side grammar remark about the duologue seem off to me i couch on the subtitles because im a canadian river standard side speaker system so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble interpret all of it it wasnt all that hard and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step motion picture show i have control were so americani loved that this picture show was countersink in toronto and in fact wish it was even more understandably countersink there i loved that the heroine was so untypically swan i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i sense that many of the issues in the picture show were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance moviesin summary if you tend to like dance motion picture show then this is a decent one if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the side standard you grew up address your narrow mind may have difficulty delight this picture show
0,jeux denfants or how the film was wrongly translated into english love me if you dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people i just dont know how i could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something certainly extremely idiotic to prove to each other wtf that they are cool dudes i know that i exaggerated some aspects but that is what the entire film is about they grow olderand instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things thinking that they are great peopleone could expect such a film from hollywood but france it is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created amelie a couple of years ago which btw the film tries to look like but is far extremely far away fromavoid avoid avoid
0,after just minutes into this film i began to world health organization miss zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial american samoa arts soldierlike films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese indium films governing for a snatch few years now and understands cristal and can speak some mandarin im sure along my opinion is different from many others as im coming from a different background shadow smmf like hero flick is not calculate really a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly not a wuxia pian film playing there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost withal timber story all the butterfly murders about green snake et al egotism while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they disdainful were actually enjoying what boldness they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as rattling well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority quentin jerome tarantino with this film thats really authoritative get quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy type a any chance crosswise of actually conveying authoritative emotions and account the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder flick if zhang woefully yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi type a the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasnt extended past her ability to play a naive witch shes so exist concentrated on her acting she comes across authoritative as cold and lifeless as though shes reading sooner her lines from a notecard its so funny to hear american critics and film people like the news report completely american samoa clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece sense i guess if they see a bunch get of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking closing sou east its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the hither vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to for certain say the wirework atomic number in this film is transcendence really wholly subpar and if theres subsist subparobvious wirework then you probably shouldnt have filmed flick it at high speed the same goes for the special effects rattling which have a distinct bmovie government feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown gallantry with no regard for non logic turning climbing and banking as exist though theres a little pilot inside i know that logic doesnt really american samoa hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you associate in nursing should probably work on your compositing a indium bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments sooner boring fight scenes really type a uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu its thirster obvious that zhang yimou is no longer television camera making at heart movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did after watching hero and smmf ive come to rotund the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood type a films hes definitely off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese film martial arts films and i thought hero was bad
0,no im not kidding if they ever propose a movie they should be kicked out of the studio im serious their movies are exactly the same in every one they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they resolve hoping to be popular and getting new about it you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these movies are poor to be on tv and go to other there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters im sure that when they were really young made some movies some studio boss bought all their rights for years or something so that now that theyre what can make in other countries whenever they want using the studios let me advise you stay away from marykate and ashley its for your own
0,the core message is strong the cast has given it their best shot the packaging is excellent but the screenplay is seriously overdramatized and every cliche in the book on womens suffering in india has been overused to the max
0,i liked this show i think it was nothing with wrong with it only that spidey dont punch anyone but only for that the subsist show doesnt suck some people only think this show is bad because of that the story me comparable was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like xmen the punisher daredevil and iron around man to bad sandman never appear exist but i kinda maine like it exist best spidey show ever my favorite episodes are turning point spider wars the hobgoblin the alien costume mutant goblin agendabut there are some episodes that was really really bad like rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch and i dont like morbius and hydro man first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i dont like exist vampires and it human beings irritates me that he was almost the main villain in season subsist of course around i have to mentioned hydro lamia man he was terrible former i rather see sandman his last appearance was so terrible mutation and i dont like spidey as the manspiderbut i guess everything than this was bad
0,dont be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one it is but that does not a good film makecomedies require a wellhoned script and masterful direction sadly this poorly executed film has neither leconte a good director in other genres does not deliver in his comedic farces les bronzes series being another examplethe comedic timing is terrible some jokes are telegraphed some are rehashed from other movies others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh the plot has messy subplots the allergic daughter the lesbian coowner and just does not develop or envelope the viewer it isnt funny and it isnt believable for a secondcompare this to any comedy by billy wilder some like it hot a foreign afair etc or by lecontes compatriot francis veber a true genius at french comedy le diner de cons le placard les comperes la chevre la grande blonde etc and youll see the difference in their tight scripts great comedic acting and timing with each joke leading to the next onewatching mon meilleur ami twice would be cruel and unusual punishment not a good sign for a comedy
0,this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school early high school age kids maybe to them its funny they may possibly even see something scary in it to me the acting is poor and plot is poor theres just not much value at all for the adult viewer i saw this film as weak and boring at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds they dont seem to have any substance other than the look at times i wasnt sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again this movie just wasnt good for me
1,okay ill say it this movie made exist me laugh so hard that economise get it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than scarcely a waste of exemplar film but the cark thing that most people type a dont get is that this movie exist was intended to be bad and cheezy exist i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the comical movie and youll find your answer instead like the original chef doeuvre jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie get turned out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its conserve all made to deliver laughter just to us viewers it certainly worked for breach mefor example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would example take care utter those words in real life of shivery course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with around an open mind and around low expectations and ball hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost
1,this movie kicks ass bar none bam and his crue have out done themselves with this film since i got the dvd days ago i videodisc have watched it three times view and it gets better every time i watch it i cant wait for grind information technology to come out comparable in theaters if its information technology anything like haggard it will be worth the waitthanks jtcellphone
1,the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a slow moody but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion the film will not be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it okin the early moments of the film we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if theyre lucky while climbing through a barbed wire fence the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him the gun through the fence the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fenceanyway once his brother is killed yrold arnold regresses into his own world he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family seems to shun him perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold even though the older brothers death allows him to hit on the kids girlfriend arnolds parents dont seem to understand how to deal with their son they really dont even try to talk to him about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after a while arnold even moves in with the old timernothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncles exwife once he meets her he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the familys turmoil with the accident from here on the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakeningthe acting is hauntingly distant in most cases robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newmans performance in hud the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody pictures about common folk this one may be for you some even may be advised to bring some tissues of starsthe hound
1,cinemas gravid point set out in postwar europe with italys neorealist movement during the next or decennium that followed jacques anatole francois thibault raw wavers caught everyones attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island someplace making bitter masterpieces but in luchino visconti brought the artform to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous act dying in venice which might as well be called the dying of europoean movie theater after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew played out and sink the torch to a raw american generation of motion picture bratwurst coppola scorsese co this motion picture absolutely feels like a opulent summingup not just of viscontis particular obsession but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to reach the esthetical ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the visconti revealed here hes not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get allow behind the pacing is a challenge slow but neer without emotional system of weights incidents are few and far between but each seems blind drunk with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmoswe will probably neer be in such rarefied company again in terminus of the movies one of the centurys great writers who inspired the story thomas thomas mann one of the gravid filmmakers guiding it visconti one of the gravid actors in the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background gustav mahlers thorium symphony taking full advantage of mahlers ability to inspire romanticism in level the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character aschenbach into a flea bitten composer from his original persona as a author level making bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk bogarde by the agency delivers what is probably gravid performance of an player in the chronicle of movies its a largely soundless performance and the player has to save reams of meaning in a gesture or a peek a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpsecinema just doesnt get better than this ill ignore the complaints from the ritalinaddicts out there who say that its too slow but level the more legitimate crab concerning some of aschenbachs flashbacks with that antagonistic acquaintance of his is mislaid the flashbacks fit neatly within the movies thematic business organisation ie which is the better path to esthetical perfection passion or condition and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions dish out to preclude drowsiness among the tv audience of course some tv audience will sleep through this motion picture anyway a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this motion picture is in reality about something and what its mostly about is suffering amatory capital r suffering in particular as a suffering amatory himself visconti knew whereof he spokespoiler i guess if for nothing else see dying in venice for its portentous initiative credits and for its unforgettable ending with bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the physical object of bogardes dying desire put up in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture the climatic successiveness sums up with agonizing economy everything that the motion picture is about love crave mantrap loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold dying in the midst of warm sunny mantrap dying in venice is a miraculous act of art videodisk tip as with the simultaneously released visconti chef doeuvre the darned i recommend that you turn the side subtitles on while watching this motion picture its on the face of it in side but the dvds strait seems sloppy and there a draw of italian verbalize during the film anyway

0,time remember have hal hartley was started what a hey that was id say the end of life was when it really brilliant going downhill but i will say story at least he went uphill are tryingtobehip one a movie that looks with it was spare on someones cell bad wouldnt when to be a phone thing if it was distinguished by an interesting that and dialog but alas those from missing along like hartleys filmed quirky dialog in their place is tedious exposition on themes in christian book of times and a trite story of a second jesus in a quandary packaged of a this modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie while hartley picks up a little in its modern half its never enjoyable or especially sensible what the hell happened to you things
1,i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the s and s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him a liberal westerner canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in leading to the largest write in campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she costarred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest

0,i might not be a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more five years after predecessor george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve kings three stories though the is handed off to michael gornick film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes but most of the blame would have to go to romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringelike script especially in those dialogues streaming through the and final story moralistic messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply took over the black humour oh it was painful and the can be said about the lively rotten score accompanying the picture loosely the three tales old chief woodenhead raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia s animation form i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep was a glowing light the first story old chief woodenhead sees elderly proprietors george kennedy dorothy lamour of a general store in a dying native community get robbed eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian that comes to live to avenge their deaths listen to george kennedy waffle and waffle on for minutes about how committed to his great community a nice touchy time well just like kennedys speeches this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never of a fine premise the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when the comes alive and turns avenger the goons a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion effects were commendably done but what about that free flowing hair how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back story the raft a of smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a lake after swimming to the raft in the middle of lake they trapped on the platform because of ominous looking creature lurking in the water now this is much better better what starts of as your basic teens run afoul into a mysteriously creepy setup thats full tight and claustrophobic tension and it doesnt even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter quite morbid it is and goes for its sense of humour too the surprisingly ending has a beautiful touch to it the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without a huge mark gornicks direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey while the alarming music score pressed the right chords the sludgelike creature in the lake like many mentioned looks like icky black tarpaulin yeah youre that right floating the water finally number three concludes with the hitchhiker a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo but shes running thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed skids off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker instead of checking getting help she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough shes being the corpse of awful but i really didnt get into this ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has herself became pitifully aggravating and downright the vivid makeup effects are welldisplayed and dripping with vision when she the hitchhiker thats when it becomes hectic cheesy and overthetop in execution there we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this happens every time she run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling in all the second story the raft and the unpleasantly is what lifts this extremely inferior

0,i dont think i can add much more to what has already been enounce about this film however i can go a small recollection from seeing stv in the theater in the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the deferred payment will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in unison normally for a movie like this at to the lowest degree some traditionalist fans stay to watch properly up until the terminal disclaimer as the people filed out i remember auditory modality no laughing and upbeat josh only sir david alexander cecil low murmursi remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic enounce that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it what an idiot the fans were the ones most clever to tear it apart firstfavorite worst scene target charge on a voyager blank space dig into through a periscope no less blank space must be a much smaller frontier than we conceive

0,no wonder this movie never saw the light of day the timing was of the release was awful the gong show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie came out so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show and the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic minute whine by chuck barris about how hard his life was as host of the show did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messedup millionaire life did he really think we even wanted to know about his life obviously so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a cia operative did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for minutes or the network executive hounding him at every turn this might have worked as the plot for a minute sitcom episode but not as a fulllength movie however it was nice to see rip taylor gene gene and the unknown comic again although to make the movie spicy they included only his most vulgar routines and as someone else has pointed out this is phil hartmans first significant movie part even though it lasts only a minute note his name is spelled hartmann in the credits which is the name he was born with you cant miss his voice and facial expressions even though hes much thinner and younger than in the snl days ed molinaro hill street blues also has a tiny part one of his first after leaving the soap world
1,dont have it away what movie or version jeff catch but this entire movie was awesome not just poitier and going the floor was riveting suspenseful and plight and for the guy complaining about diachronic accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory but they had no authority to nab whites outside of indian territory as a predominate they did not patrol but exert endorsement on criminals only i did find it odd that corby didnt seem to have any indian friends i have it away their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange even as corby returned to his people his indian cohort remain faceless and nameless
1,the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television historyits hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence sublime writing or first rate performancesacross its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality centering around the life of one tony soprano a man who lives in two families one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group of which he is the boss of both played by james gandolfini of true romance and the mexican fame tony is a fascinating scary but also likable guy full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tonythe cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for everthe true genius of this tale however is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series twenty minute long dream sequences powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love honour and respect for family the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitouswith tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as americas most original and compelling drama forget family redifined this is television redifined

0,i saw this film at its new high falls film festival screening as and must say that i found it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden the lovely lady and the voice the narrator whom i have never of a lot to be desired jcmac i felt the redeeming feature this film true action and grit and out of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast a tighter reign the directing this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it not sent out general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in lidl
0,seeing all of negative reviews for this movie i that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasnt quite meant to be i watched first two fight scenes listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren and all of the other thrownin oriental and i found the movie so awful that it was funny then lee enters the story and the oneliners start flying plot falls apart the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out welcome as it turns into the worst action movie everlungren beats out his previous efforts in punisher and others as well as all van dammes seagals movies and stallones nonrocky movies for this distinct honor this has the absolute check out tia carreres face when she is in any scene with dolph thats worth a laugh the worst dialogue ever brandon lees comment about little dolph the worst ever in a film and the worst outfit in a dolph full japanese attire tango and with acting meets commando meets friday the because of the senseless nudity and performance is very jason voorheeslike in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a moviethe good how about not awful performances go to the bad guy who still looks constipated through his entire performance and carrere who says her lines without breaking out laughing brandon lee is just there being lungrens sidekick and a really awful job thatan awful awful movie fear it and avoid it if you do watch it though ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most nonunderwater shots speaking of the underwater shots check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fightsceneending ever this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to between the flashes of nuditya bad bad movie
0,st movie point out ever ill start with saying come on wasnt that unsound was it no it wast that unsound actually i laughed and titter enough times through the movie so i cannot enunciate with paw on my inwardness that it was rubbishits totally unlike this and epic poem movie epic poem movie sucked unsound doh how so masses would ask ill tell you how this movie is not as nearly as senseless not to mention that the stupid and i enunciate stupid because it is but being stupid makes it funny stuff that pass off around and with the characters is actually enjoyable in this movie not the best around but hey what would you gestate look at the bill sticker some masses said it was stupid i find that when writing a point out one should be more objective my own opinion but yeah of course it was stupid its a movie about stupid look im not telling you to croak and watch the movie now or else you missed the consequence of the century what i am telling is that if you hap to view the movie somewhere please dont cut up your eyes on the opening credits view what its all about who knows you might similar it a biti impart it for not being so unsound and get to me laugh and some unexpectedly good sexrelated jokes
0,its inauspicious that many of the other detractor of this film seem influenced by prior biases ie anger at the merry graphic symbol thinking french thrillers are defective etc i will admit that im unfamiliar with the novel but as a film after about minutes i was rolling my eye hopefully i can explicate in writing my complaints eloquently adequate before i get sick of spending any longer clock time on this film over the hours of its running length hours that felt the like dont get me wrong i can sit through time of day and a half silent films time of day heroic poem i dont have a short attending span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant revalue a subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery store list of complaints number off the ending yes it had a scoobydooesquire character explicate everything at the end now i actually think for this movie this was necessary the film had so many plottwists emotional revealing new fact surfacing and being attain one reader said it well yes it is a very consistent story but without the very essential binding story their puerility stories the family relationship amongst the parents the family relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man it just doesnt feel right i felt screw i habit throw in too many spoilers here i could key out specific revealing that i thought were unnecessary but grant to the reviews on here theres a lot of people who seem to really love this so i dont want to afford anything off i in person cant stand soap opera the complexity and twists and turns for me snuffed out any encroachment the final revealing could perchance deliver by the end i seriously didnt tutelage there werent any gaping plot holes necessarily this look the like it could make a big holy scripture in writing it is perfectly consistent but if im supposed to believe this is reality something doesnt sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted too often i felt crucial graphic symbol we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot increase the emotion and develop the mystery the acting i had no complaints about the directing eh not defective but the plot and especially its development gravely miss sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller but i couldnt get into it i gave this a but because i dont want to seem completely unjust and it did have moments of slight connive and excitement major spoiler and i have to mention it but when the father is make his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldnt fit in another twist your father didnt kick the bucket in a hunting stroke i almost fail when was the father at all arise or flush really mentioned much in the binding story are you good the like the already complex plot involving graphic symbol from all the families and their family relationship to one another wasnt adequate does the agonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as much as ive always been bothered in any film

1,its unmatchable of the best moving picture that i have seen this year i dont agree with the somebody who said its tiresome of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all but personally i spent a very good moment this movie alterns very fountainhead sex tantrum with frightening tantrum there is besides a nice touch of sense of humour for example when the wife tells her husband that in her puerility she was abused by her founding father and then her husband says how can someone abuse someone like you and then he try to attach her on the bed for sexual games d very funny i recommend this movie to everyone and by the way of life sorry for my poor english im from france

0,so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic of congo drc and the beginnings of its from rule i to become familiar with the figures involved in history mainly lumumba and mobutu wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule the political motives behind each the reasons behind belgiums decision to give the its independence and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief that this movie was made by people who through a passing with the story of the drcs fight freedom saw a story filled with drama emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them out with dialogue went to the and shot i could be wrong but so its all the sadder because then makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history whatever reason the fact is that the could be of sentencelong statements and printed on the screen the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main idea of whats going completely smoothing over the actual details favor getting across the big things instance there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the the soldiers have three possible with lumumba one that vilifies lumumba and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying orders correspondingly there are three that speak in the scene uttering lines that unadornedly their points of view then to avoid dealing with actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating up this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time character simply their basic motives other characters respond with theirs and thats that theres little through actions even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness its hard to believe the people represented acted like that also in the trend of this directness things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact we never learn what these factions are what fighting for their power basically anything except that they the characters likewise onedimensional and flat unfortunately i dont know whether was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after hour or of the movie i certainly didnt trust it to tell me drc like many developing countries has a complicated important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these will not be useful recognition the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details and ends telling viewer little except the most general of outlines
1,this is one of my all time favourite movies if ur not into cars then forget it this movie features of aussies greatest muscle cars the xygtho yeah so the acting not the greatest it was never made to win an oscar the car action will keep you comin back for more and more there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the s and an awesome chev with a real cool cat drivin it also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this movie big fast cars with pleantly of steelno plastic cars and some cool street dragging i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting
1,this is an excellent anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of ufo or space first series of course it isnt some sfx extravaganza or star wars pseudomystic tripe fest but a subtle movie that has a slow pace yet it conveys the creepy eerie and uncanny atmosphere of the best anderson productions for lovers of cerebral scifi lynn lorings voice is absolutely awful sfx are good for this kind of product and acting is good as well two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home insteador do they ah videophones every now and then peddled as the next everyones gadget next decade but still to happen years later the device of earths twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera tai daiakuju giron so who copied whom
1,i will divide my review into following categories each accounting a maximum of if perfect visual pleasure this is extremely pleasing movie visually i had a great time watching it golfing scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing i also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bagdirectors work bill paxton is more associated to acting but this film shows hes got talent did a decent jobacting shia lebeouf was very good in his role of francis ouimetthis guy can act well the rest of the cast was also goodentertainment value i enjoyed every minute of it it was overwhelmingly entertainingscript based on a true story and therefore it makes the film that much more special it was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene till the very end my advice definitely a must watch for all the sports lovers especially golfyou all will love it anyone who is looking for a nice entertaining movie and doesnt hate sports can watch it

0,this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids the message of the film about dealing with loss is subverted by the return of the young girls father during the films credits team rocket provide some amusement but theyre not really part of the small plot so they dont appear very often
0,thought i just might get a few laughs from long drawn film but was sadly disappointed this film is all about who spend most of their time trying to passing grade with out even trying to open a book or accomplish anything the film also portrayed and the principal mary tyler moore mrs starklabor pains as complete idiots i know suppose be a comedy but it never made me laugh and i the entire film a complete waste of time however all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to this film an and entertaining just plain studying and getting good grades for college is the way to go
0,i might not be a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more five years after its predecessor george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve kings three stories though the direction is handed off to michael gornick the film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by gornick but most of the blame would have to go to romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringelike script especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story moralistic messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply took over the black humour oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture loosely linking the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia s animation form i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light the first story old chief woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors george kennedy dorothy lamour of a general store in a dying native community dead river get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths listen to george kennedy waffle and waffle on for minutes about how hes committed to his great community what a nice touchy feely time well just like kennedys speeches this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when the indian comes alive and turns avenger the goons meet a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion the effects were commendably done but what about that free flowing hair how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back ugh second story the raft follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water now this is much better much better what starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy setup thats full of tight and claustrophobic tension and it doesnt even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark gornicks direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side while the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords the sludgelike creature in the lake like many have mentioned looks like an icky black tarpaulin yeah youre reading that right floating on the water finally number three concludes with the hitchhiker a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo but shes is running late thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed she skids off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker instead of checking or getting help she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough shes being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhikernot awful but i really didnt get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired the vivid makeup effects are welldisplayed and dripping with vision when she hits the hitchhiker thats when it becomes hectic cheesy and overthetop in its execution from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this happens every time she decides to run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling in all the second short story the raft and the unpleasantly wellconceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel
1,this is an enjoyable project that is not a film as the title suggests good performance by nadia dajani who reenacts the role of grace i follows the reenactment of what happens to mike and grace in new york city she leaves but he wants to get in contact with her this project is his way of trying to getting in touch with heri saw it on ifc i have heard that it will be released on dvd as well i do like this trend of more independent projects this is an example of a good projecti hope that he finds hertake a look and be entertainedkirbyef
1,a hugely enjoyable screen version of rona jaffes bestselling potboiler about the trials and tribulations and naturally the of a group of women involved in way or another in the new publishing business directed by jean negulesco fairly fresh from the success of three in a fountain and the prototype for the likes sex and the city except that here the sex all takes offscreenthe bright young female talents of the hope lange diane baker suzy parker martha hyer are all nicely cast while joan crawford pops up as a queen bitch of an editor who could eat meryl streeps miranda priestly and spit her out with absolutely no effort at all she steals the movie the include stephen boyd louis jourdan if rossano brazzi be louis jourdan robert evans before decided wisely to go behind camera and aherne there are suds on display than you will find in your average launderette but if me enjoy desperate housewives not to mention carrie bradshaw and company then you will probably this a very guilty pleasure
1,i watch them allits not better than the amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we dance japanese version but its completely respectable and pleasingly different in partsi am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting for example the name should scream dont watch how she move since when can movie titles ignore grammar there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar its just not canadian standard english grammar comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because im a canadian standard english speaker so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it it wasnt all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so americani loved that this movie was set in toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance moviesin summary if you tend to like dance movies then this is a decent one if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie
1,this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy but profane woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero sound familiar there are plenty of holes in this story things just dont add up and some of the suspense is a little corny but that suspense is very good there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it the story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way making it an involving movie for the viewer thats why i give it a pretty good rating the movie gets you involved in it bullock is more cute than annoying which she normally is to me so this is my highestrated movie with her in it
0,i cant believe it type a i thought this is a good sequel when jim carry in the film has think a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors stupid plot and stupid scenes this should be in crappest films of sht in earth thank icky god the same director did not make rather mrs simpson this reckon because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny not get the pee and not the dancing i laughed at this because stupid person of how stupid the person made this non like homer simpson making a movie about a doughnut i wish someone makes a remake of son of the mask with a plot like this the mask guy indium jim carry and his wife have a son which is a normal baby when the baby finds get another mask he became the shitty flick mask too and the channel mask guy tries to get his mask back this is very crap so ill give it a and then out of helium fuking sht
1,this is a cinema that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two cinema but the sort of people eyesight this cinema will in all probability own the box set or at to the lowest degree know someone who does and you shouldnt hold out in expecting steel runner the cinema budget doesnt stretch quite a that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the cinema is a skill fiction set in succeeding yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or awake and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control nab takashi miike isnt one to give all of his argue to you on a platter but one can assume that the legal philosophy on facts of life enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased liveliness spans and so forward interestingly the dialogue in the cinema is in the main cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always bright speak japanese and a few speak side people have criticised the side as being wooden but i found no trouble with it also another person found the gayness themes throughout the cinema to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i chamfer see this cinema as an revilement to homosexuals he simply calls back school of thought of ancient greece when homo or hermaphroditism was more park the cinema contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this cinema the action is more martialarts based and are fare in a very skillful hong kong style the cinematography in the cinema is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a skillful control on coloring material to give the air a polluted flavour and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days fundamentally theres a lot to ilk in this cinema a skillful sense of body fluid exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a act tinny but isnt that part of the charm

0,ego seems its the only reason this movie was made this movie is so wrong in so many ways that its below ones dignity to write much about it every character was only good at self praise and lead actors i use this term liberally as has the director emote in the likeness of stone the little story if that fails on the basic aspects such as logic feeling and drama direction leaves much to be desired blatant flaws are all over the place character motives arent defined prospective husbands are found overnight broken car windows mend themselves among other thingslets face it himesh cant act neither it seems can hansika motwani in her defense shes still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of makeup raj babbar overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible darshan jariwala laughs a bit too much the actor who plays himeshs friend is the only natural a few questions do come to mind how can such a film cost rs where did the money go granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika sherawat was paid an obscene rs for her minute appearance and songs but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind including mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police carthe good himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark topi lets give the devil his due himesh as usual gives good musicthe bad direction story himeshs singing is still hard to ignorethe ugly dialogs and everything elsefinal word painful in every sense of the word watch this movie only if you loved subhash ghais yaadein
0,i felt that the movie was dry very disappointing no plotkept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone a wast of money one of robins williams worst filmsif you dont believe me wait a few months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that dont do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over this is one you will not want to see or say why did i spend my money on that plus for it being such a new movie there were only people in the watching it this was on a friday night the showing i also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake when they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying

1,i thought this was a splendid showcase pullulate for mandys bodacious bod unconditional if you two fold dont expect anything else such as clever plot twists and believable character development you wont be hanker disappointed consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who threaten to come between her and her mommy suzanna arquette who obviously doesnt want to play type a the sex kitten she leaves that reckon up to her daughtermandys face is secret plan a little too perfect bath norse manifestly but her pullulate around body is a complete alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a perfect to ratio of waist to hips delight period of play and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there boldness has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to sec the eye mandy indium certainly is the model for subsist this idealized ratioand no flat butt to boot which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the nether hemispheres mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her suffice losing her towel as she descended into the candlelit scarcely hot tub with her blindfolded germanguy victim no but from all i could see accommodate from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and indium didnt need a double to yearn prove itmandys acting abilities had little flame to do with her impression of a psychotic mommys girl with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones her bath bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in manakin the hot tub get after a long flirtation with german guy get no who also happened to be her mothers lover added physical structure an likewise additional snap dimension to an otherwise onedimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses delight always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the latina social station housekeeper was edited out in the televised exist version for some obscure reasonmandys ubernordic facial features coupled boldness with her ubervoluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse if mandy really wants to further her career boldness as an type a actress id advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages especially italian and spanish and maybe french although i dont know if they would go for her type but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her exist vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic exist and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body pullulate in a cheesy movie to enable exist her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by flame michelle johnson of the s whose exist early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of rio de janeiro skin flicks that failed to make it off the groundvambo drule
1,this movie of antediluvian minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey differentiate home of odysseus after the troy no more war it is an get epic story about the ancient minoan and fifty fifty mycenaean civilizations told at list years get down after those events look on toke adaptation place around bcthis is a movie so if you antediluvian patriarch buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no love other language than italian even the close caption is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english powerfully subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to commend watch this movie
0,i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was in by my girlfriend into going this dreck her mom we my gfriend and i walked about an into it what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargonsub particles are thoughts by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals a drop of the rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated wow what a rigorous scientific study im sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight the same should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder hogwash hooey bull pucky btw it was funded by the ramtha cult the of which was one of the experts which were interview by the filmmakers no ulterior motives here right
0,as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about the worst film ever made let me see how many different words i can use to describe it boring unbearable laughable lousy stupid horriblei could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the pointi would have given this a if possiblebad acting bad directing bad production bad plotthis was made in and it looks more like very low budget boring plot horrible acting really bad special effects etci rarely ever see a scifi film i absolutely think is this bad i mean this is pure garbage it has nothing going for it either as far as a bmovie this is the very bottom of the loti think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for minutes junk like this gives good lowbudget b movies a bad name this makes ed wood movies look goodthe thing about watching directtovideo movies is just when you think youve seen the worst you see something even worsedj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand outavoid this waste at all costs oh the humanity
1,this is sad this movie is the cover this should at least be in the crown picture show here this is even the best process movie ever done the process picture show of today are ill done the actors and process conductor do not no how to do it fighting and stunt properly only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan the stunt are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever the start where chan and his team go down the hill car pursual through the hill town is just amazing the end fight stunt are for me the best fight stunt ever redact to film the end stunt slide down the celestial pole crashing through the glaze jackie was ill hurt
1,but it is kinda uproarious at least if you get up on weird al like i did its a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins its uneven in places but some of the section are still very funny specially when he goes to japanese archipelago although its not quite as emotionally textured as befuddled in translation and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does catch in a bottle the perfectly bizarre cultural melange that is tokio street lifeperhaps weird al isnt discern as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would flavour just as sweet still this is a funny movie
1,paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film ive ever seen often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some journo once called it the thinking persons nightmare on elm street and while i accept the logic of his conclusion i cant help but think its a tag that is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate theyre really not thinking at all in fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea quite simply paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart as someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing to be honest i make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste stop reading now because theres more to come its so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood often overlooked in a seamless and convincing way and yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away add to all this an incredibly talented director bernard rose imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack youre ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why i have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express
1,this movie is complex and interesting in so many ways it is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects sex and love womens emotional abuse of men mens physical abuse of women sexual child abuse fresh approach to religion in real life and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues musici promise you that if you sit through the first minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters and the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliantand the dvd has some great features including samuel jacksons background of learning to play guitar and feel the bluesthis movie is not for children and i even caution parents of teenagers
1,i disagree with anyone who donet like this flick i used to love this flick when i was slight and i still do its dessert funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendly relationship can never be destroyed and even though it didnt have much of a story it was still splendid i give it a and two thumbs up ohio yeah and it proves that your deepest wishs and dreams can hail true shoot teari love this flick in person if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful slight flick and im glad that at least some masses like it
0,robert altmans downbeat in western from edmund place book mccabe was overlooked at the time of its the but part the following years has garnered a sterling critical past aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the characters here dont merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally in and unappealing bearded warren beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur the settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel certain from of being solemn in beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want newfangled of the action altman creates a coming wintry atmosphere for who movie which gives the audience a minds sense profits time and naughtons but the action in the sorry little town release limitedmost of this story being made up of vignettesand altmans pacing is deliberately slow theres hardly a statement start is just the opposite in fact and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their once its a selfdefeating picture and yet brackish an way altmanquirky it wears defeat proudly made

1,this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up of its lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat fraidy cats previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different eras in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy i watched this movie almost every day as a child o
0,first off the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which i dont understand how was missed you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film the first time i saw it i just said well mistakes happen and brushed it off after about the th time it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny if you havent seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the microphone might make for pretty interesting gamenow about the film this movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid ghost story however the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely you begin watching the movie under the assumption alluded by the tv commercials that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger the opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film spoiler the movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force in the home the idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar the young boy also witnesses this supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed after his family is killed the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as wellas i said this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a twoyearold this began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well completely ruining the only children can see illusion set forth by the commercials and opening sceneregardless of this the movie didnt actually get ruined until the plot twist at the end in which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie all of a sudden after being attacked by a swarm of crows the man snaps and tries to kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his family which he killed at the beginningthe whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf first why was the familys souls trapped in a house if the director was going for a juon the grudge approach in which the family after dying in a fit of rage would haunt the house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting stop after the father was captured by the ghosts of his family if the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them why were they attacking the new family heres another one for you it takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest this tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie was living on the property for months during all this time why didnt the ghosts just go kill him this movie included a lot of clichd horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies however im telling ya this movie still couldve pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end its like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending for this movie to have been a success they shouldve stuck with the only children can see them premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning wouldve opened the door for possible sequeltoo
0,a bad movie about a bad movie is that original or what if it is then thats the only good thing about it the lovely ally sheedy couldnt stop this bomb from exist destroying movie theaters and vcrs everywhere it should also be noted that she and all over the other actors practically hired by danny aiellos character were billed as themselves as affair well as the characters they played in his practically drated film calling it a brated spoiled former film is too flick much of a compliment and would lead to delusions of grandeur
1,i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction the way it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very interestingthe portuguese the japanese and the various communities being managed by the king the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason the wardrobe is fine the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective

1,even though this was a disaster in the box office it is my favorite film it gives a powerful message of family it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more realistic it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan if you want to see the indian godfather amitabh portrays that in this film dont read reviews by critic theyre just ignorant this movie has good mix of comedy romance drama and especially action so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon nastill good movie this is the movie
0,this is virtually the spoilt film you will ever see doomsday currently attract the rug from under this nonpareil for me the prop up are a sodding example of what frank zappa once referred to as cheepnis it looks as if the blank space scenes were made in a s power station just prior to demolition the music really soak up the act as is wooden and ham the characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing the plot of ground is predictable it is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy proficiency and ideas from other films the quality of direction beggars beliefbut you have to see it if only to experience what has to be nonpareil of the biggest wastes of a lilliputian budget ever this is a priceless example of a stupid movie
1,dont know what film or version exist jeff saw but this entire film was awesome not just poitier and going the story extraneous police was riveting suspenseful and engaging and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy rivet marshals in the indian territory but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory as a rule they did not patrol but exercised warrants on criminals only i awful masses did find it odd that corby didnt police force seem to have any indian friends i know justify their numbers just were diminished but it still strikes me as exist strange even as corby returned to his people his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless
0,the moving picture is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being fresh one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which speech sound very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you comprehend from the material of the titlei frankly didnt like the style of the moving picture i believe that anxiety confusion and thick blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i dont get is why there is so much of it the moving picture is cheap on scenes and tell the story basically with no human being aspect in it at all it contribute the comedian book like experience notwithstanding its visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with legal brief dialog monotonic scenes dynamic cut euphony and abrupt noisesthe movies plot line is very simple most of whats going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in discombobulate delirium simulating effects of dose use and dynamic cutsi will say openly that this moving picture didnt fit my expetations a tiny flake

0,ok this motion picture show was really unparalleled shall we state carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the motion picture show even though it is said she had a coke problem during the motion picture show but she said that she cant think to much of it well thats her excuse but whats everyone elses i cant think they all had a coke problemwhatever it wasnt all that bad i entail i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny story consequence although the part where the bozo gets that matter shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste ohio well i guess i was disappointed lawsuit carrie fisher is like so awesome and this motion picture show did nothing for her
1,the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous selfdesctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh atsympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked bestsimon geist is a man in his late searly s who creates a popculture driven editorial magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitchslap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his livein female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the musicvideo queen for a bunch of brated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if youre in the indieart house crowd mark my words
0,if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable im from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment
0,oh boy films care this really bother me if this movie is conjectural to close to truth then i assume that rommel knew hitler for a clip before wwii started in the movie rommel refer how hitler had changed from before well i cant envisage that rommel wouldnt have hump something about hitlers government policies so rommel must share some guilt for the german atrocities with that in mind i have a trouble with a movie that produce rommels life at the end a tragic one he made his pick and we have to feel bad for him i cant do it i also cant buy the theory that if the more competent full general were allowed to fight the warfare the allies would have had more trouble taking it if more competent people were in charge wwii may neer have started in the first place from a movie watching panorama the film jumps from place to place and most of the clip seems care a history special with big name actors represent the historical roles leo g carroll has a yoke of good scenes with james alfred edward woodley mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke side without the nonsensical accents but other than that not very necessary
1,this is how movies are hypothetic to be made a fascinating determine characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and cut that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being kitschy highly recommended
0,i along was searching through hollywood video last investigator night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new spoiled years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed through with spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf type a seize and it looked like spell it might be a decent bgrade horror movie exist the cover looked sufficiency fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont enough be fooled by the cover earphone which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than exist the movie intellect itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer unknown called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed type a city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world hit of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is shelf and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it shelf was laughable the seek opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to type a some guy then exist a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts silly crawling for absolutely no reason on while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is horrifying the entire movie looks spell like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from support believable and the scenes with the policemen on seize the phone were awful the along voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold tape my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad exist everything was just badoverall severed is a failed attempt at exist what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think rear end if this film had exist been neglect handled silly better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can comparable tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this information technology straighttovideo garbage it earphone had a little potential but it boast was get beyond a mess
0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose seppaku going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime ministerif this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this
1,this moving picture is a lyrical and romantic memoir assure through the eyes an eleven year one time son living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love the name calling cuba libre and cuban ancestry are merely essay to wrong market this as an action moving picture dreaming of julia makes much more sentiency it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to peoples everyday lives and sideline that fact alone makes the moving picture more honest than most works dealing with this time period in cuban historythe excessive apply of the voiceover narrator does subvert the report but the moving picture makes up for it with unqualified snip from hollywood films that articulate so much more visually than the narrator couldthe comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair gamy as the moving picture does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love the revolution like the moving picture julie never seems to have an termination
0,pilot mitch macafee morrow sees ufo while test flying a planebut nothing up on radar then planes and ships start disappearing reports of a ufo increase it turns out its giant monster bird that is attacking and killing but what is it and why is it here has all the right elements for a classic it an actually pretty entertaining scripti was never really bored the acting is good for a s monster movie morrow doesnt overdo macho hero act and mara corday is quite good as requisite female love interest shes also strong and takes care of herselfeven though she is off getting food and for everyone all during the movie the problem is the monster dear godits terrible it looks like a deranged turkey it a long neck a hilariously stupid beak teeth a few strands of hair on its and claws andoh yesit squawks not roaringsquawking the actors had no idea what it looked was added after production actors morrow corday were horrified when they finally saw in a theatre morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the ended sam katzman responsible for this he wanted to save money gave the world the monster ever and you can see wires moving it too this gets stars because morrow and corday are so good and the script is well it gets no for pathetic till you it attack what is obviously toy train worth a look if youre a horror fan to see what has to be stupidest monster ever
0,daniel auteuils bruno in petites couperes is a middleaged model of his pierre in christian vincents la separation of years ago in both films youthful confidence in leftwing ideology and love mutual metaphors crumbles into paranoia manifesting itself as trapped aggression in pierre and desperately comic womanizing in the more recent brunounfortunately for auteuil fans the actor has become reliant on a uniform worldweariness not unlike compatriot johnny hallyday in lecontes recent lhomme du train acting it aint and becomes rather frustrating as the film progresses pascal bonitzer doesnt help as the writerdirector of the project his sequencing of episodes overlaid with connecting symbolism fail to mask the films lack of rhythm i was particularly furious that the imposingly dramaticromantic backdrops of grenoble were made virtually redundant by a cameraman who was obviously shivering in the coldkrisitn scott thomas almost rescues the show with her female counterpart to bruno beatrice she dramatizes the dizzying contradictions intended as bruno in a character of increasing complexity to the point of becoming surreal bonitzer cannot sustain this though and the flagging plot demands beatrice to even out into another bourgeois mannequin in doing so bonitzer shows then denies scott thomas the oscar cabinetall the characters submersion into the bourgeoisie may be a viable and indeed tragic outcome but in this case its a copout of a cadence unlike the brutal painful denouement of la separation a serious disappointment
0,some of the secondary actors try really hard and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely otherwise this film is horriblewilliam shatners character harvey is an amateur screenwriter hes also a psychopath a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie even if that means taking a film crew hostage do amateur screenwriters grovel maybe they dothe films setup is way too long we dont get to the point of the story until well into the second half the first half darts and flits among assorted charactersshoot or be shot is touted as a comedy but i found it totally not funny dialogue contains no subtext none of the characters are believable as real people theyre all stick figures that perform action in a way that resembles cartoon characters indeed the film is basically a cartoon for adults silly inane birdbrainedi can understand why some actors are in this film they need the money or the exposure but what are insiders shatner and harry hamlin doing here maybe shatner wants more comedy roles is this the best he can do is hamlin that desperate for money he used to be a respected actor what happenedeven though the story is supposed to be a satire it comes across more as a putdown of amateur screenwriters maybe that wasnt the intent but thats certainly how the film can be interpreted as such the script was very very poorly written
1,on cast terrible script laughable of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the into scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes poorly movie platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects and fix the problem highly blowing the was off the monster awesome this only who missing head it unnecessary graphic sex watch during one of the sure haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists enjoy full one liners i by enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make killings youre in for for good laugh i recommend the take to people thing can watch a a and not movie it so a i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made serious people to take it seriously however if you can scene it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you they can this movie in the way an was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a have beers and couple a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy evil my life
0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the th century where a serial of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar finger to james giant frankenstein and this is combine by the entry of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided idea for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only utilize as a redherring by having distrust light on batloving village simpleton woody herman dwight frye therefore providing the exempt for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed onethis is one of a trine of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred besides doctor ex and the secret of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film lose from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are bequeath with is a poorquality frankenstein fake with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would clamber to even be considered as a horror and it is deserving remark that manager frank stray was doing the blondie films a few years later
1,this is the first out of that ive given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action there isnt any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the style where the shakiness and different just made it like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see action movie that doesnt to please all sectors of the public ie theres forced romancei liked the first bourne movies loved onewarning after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit driving your car
1,i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a family get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an ex pat she was very antibritish she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end
0,one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is a of the worst elements of the rocky horror show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
0,i get wont type a go and give them my bucks i went and bought to the lowest degree the fourth season of the original and the best at want pilot least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing affair i have a teenager and she rear end tike thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original and she thinks jessica simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like wholly maine whole melody a slut than daisy duke pilot those shorts she might wholly as well not be wearing anything at all and since when is american pie have anything to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car that in itself should have gotten the movie a r rating get the only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals lets all hope so the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should desire have looked
0,speck was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck there is however not much killing to be found in this movie and none of it is explicitly shown the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub yet even this is merely implied and not shown save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr specks leg the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voiceover which should be a testament to the mindnumbingly boring nature of this movie every aspect of this movie is horrible unless you have a fondness for boredom dont bother this movie only clocks in at minutes but it feels like an eternity
0,this movie started out as a quite decentlooking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didnt manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all its supposed to be a horror movie but there wasnt a single scene that was close to frightening or even excitingto be frank the actors werent all that either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysoverall a watchable movie but it doesnt anything and once finished watching it it last long until its already forgottenthe reason i watched was because i had some review giving top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it out of if you still want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch juon instead
0,i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel violated i had read the reviews and heard the warnings and i thought i was prepared for anything at best i thought a faithful if misguided attempt at an original adaptation at worst a sogooditsbad plan for the new millennium so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk i joked to my friends prepare for the worst movie ever made oh cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film the special effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx the acting is terrible the accents are worse than terrible one artillery mans accent seems to take us on a tour of the british isles from scotland to wales via northern ireland the dialogue is stilted the editing is nonexistent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words really cannot describe how bad this movie is from the union flag flying from the horribly cgid thunderchild the royal navy flies the white ensign not the union flag to the woodworm ridden acting this is quite simply a crime against film making when you consider some of the literallyzerobudget fan films that are available on the net the star wars short troops for example the whole were enthusiastic amateurs argument goes right out of the window and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website this film had an figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the problem is that hines co tried to make a film of the book rather than turn the book into a film if that makes any sense characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words ironically enough the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers the exsoft porn actress my advice pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesnt screw up and go watch the spielberg version it may not be true to the text of the book but i can say this as a lifelong hg wells fan and englishman as well speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i want them back
0,st watched out of dir pete riski weird psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being tested in a hospital the power flickers and then all hell breaks loose im honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one what we get for the next hour and a halfat least it wasnt longer was a twisted horrortwilight zonezombiefestghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very end initially after the power goes out everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father there is the typical annoying character a creepy old man and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and of course the young girl the main character gets attracted to random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing a hinting that time has stopped and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever theyre in of course the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and i really hate how they used this girls affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame we never really find out the answer to what was going onwhich is very strange so please avoid this dog unless you want to be creeped out and confused for one hour and a half this is not for you or any moviegoer what a waste of timereally

0,i am a huge horrorsplatter fan i even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid i also like gore the more the merrier as long as it has a pointafter reading the other peoples reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a little gem but much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films ive ever watchedthe acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was pointless the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past years usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie but not in this casei waisted eur to get this dvd unless you actually enjoy pointless gore for example the violent sht films avoid at any cost

1,from one other imdb reviewer has remarked this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably better as a goes along yes it is released the predecessors corman up yes it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher occasional roger such as fatal attraction and poison lustful however the juxtapositioning of by more career from a rising blues singer against the husbands gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for of the as and physical void or up while shes away along with the the use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done utilizing as very i number freudian locations and characters and also using water in almost excellent scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout this amanda though clearly suffering is a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways filling the wifes fully realized may more recent scenario namely the french clever swimming the which it seems of me at least and have other liberally some useful ideas as hole against amanda with it smaller tool set and against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ones budget ivy temptations but accomplishes this emotional well or better a borrowed films in this genre film twist to the stepfather abuse of movie in the past again very plight is also very unique in this genre and interesting i agree with other viewers about pool unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amandas of this aspect of the story elicits the cast as every small think
0,movie contains a scene deneuve in a bathtub she stunning for a lady age is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress none of deneuves appeal the director apparently peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as students imitation of the greenaway without any of his inspiration

1,i got to see the movie on thin ice on the television in india i must say the movie was genuinely well cause and genuinely sent a quiver down my spine the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others unruffled remain addictedhowever i finger that diane keaton was at her best the picture where she has cravings and begins rummaging her household for cocaine was the best the two boys are good and lynda boyd also point what a good actress she isthe playscript is well cause as is the cinematography and focus and castinga must must view movie for everyone
0,arahan adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre to compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of stephen chows films is a mistakefirstly the fight scenes are nothing new all that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of yimou zhang tony jaa and jackie chan fights in intelligent motion pictures need logic there seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the matrix sequelsthe attractive female lead soyi yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as ziyi zhang had done so easily in house of flying daggers having a martial arts background serves well in kung fu movies to cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake see aya ueto in asumi unless you are a very talented director which as arahan proves seungwan ryoo is not

1,this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that is bad it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character consequently if you are not into tragedies this is not your movie it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile if you liked dostoyevskys crime and punishment you will probably like this if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the movie prompts is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publiclyaproved ideas for another set the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quoif you are a conservative you will not like this movie besides other philosophical questions i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start also there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters if these sorts of things do not impress you skip it overall i give this movie a
1,unbelievably close to real feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor a wannabe redneck played to perfection by brad renfro although the story may seem slightly farfetched the two boys attempt to several miles to a doctor who claims to have the cure aids actions and all characters involved are close to real life being big brother to a boy in similar situation who died a few years after this film was released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone has ever wondered what really happens in the life of child with aids superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship illness prejudice and final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity
0,a lowrent tattily made police thriller thats kept bearable by some fair humorous bits the nice chemistry between the ii leads and particularly by william james remars satisfying turn as a egotistic psychopathic and naturally indestructible villain obviously a lowquality picture both visually and dramatically with a rather resigned burt but not unwatchable
1,ah classic comedy at the point in the movie where brains get mess together a two bit scene with bruce joseph campbell beating himself up part reminds me of how simplistic movies and theme can grab you and wrap you into a whole moviefor years and years bruce joseph campbell bonk what kind of movies we privation out of him we privation to see weird movies like bubba ho tep we privation to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies and we privation to see man with the screaming brain with the deed unparalleled one bonk that its hold up to border that completely zany character of movie like ground forces of wickedness only with more zany and less monstersthe idea of the movie is simple bruce sees doctor up doctor up has new idea bruce gets sorry things happen to him on way to see doctor up coincidently its the thing the doctor up need to designate him that saves him hilarity ensueswith the addition of teddy boy raimi as a weird russian rib and journeyman stacy keach as dr ivan ivanovich ivanov its funny that does this movie complete funny never a point of scaryif you like the zany bruce joseph campbell youll like this then again why would you be watching this if you didnt like bruce joseph campbell
1,gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a trivialityand to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as dramabut i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years immensely sympathetic performance from jared harriss who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charismahopefully without poor richards penchant for hellraising and haminessand charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer radiant location photography including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to lifeand making magic in the dark
0,at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles setthe plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of thingsor just a lot was edited from the movie the characters identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didnt seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the moviei suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they hadif they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didnt so now theres a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opiniondont waste your time or money
0,shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the sang froid mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense in reality of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually military mission care about the people dying you have no more to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a information technology bunch of random acts of violence former the problem is especially pigheadedness compounded hither when you have tons of characters all of decently very well whom dieok so if you cant be bothered to battle make the characters memorable exist or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for extremely why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because fifty fifty the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to withal abandon their defy meaningless missions thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbfine fine there is no character development and exist the plot provides rear end no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting exist in cool action scenes right yet putting to death nonmeaningful again no in fact many of the fights arent even fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in rear end my opinion im talking about things like lalala im walking vernacular along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not even halfway through beaver state the film i threw my caboodle hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it
0,after just minutes into this film i began to miss zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin im sure my opinion is different from many others as im coming from a different background smmf like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story all the butterfly murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this film thats really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasnt extended past her ability to play a naive witch shes so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if theres subparobvious wirework then you probably shouldnt have filmed it at high speed the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though theres a little pilot inside i know that logic doesnt really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did after watching hero and smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films hes definitely off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero was bad

0,robert altmans downbeat newfangled western from edmund naughtons book mccabe was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the characters here dont merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally brackish and unappealing bearded warren beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel once the profits start coming in beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place but the action in this sorry little town is limitedmost of the story being made up of vignettesand altmans pacing is deliberately slow theres hardly a statement being made just the opposite in fact and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds its a selfdefeating picture and yet in an altmanquirky way it wears defeat proudly from

1,first the obviousas a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama quay is disconcerting straightly independent and a menace to banality jouvets aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force his antoine is not so much a man of intellect but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct quay is not subversive in the sense that todays and already yesterdays philistines enjoy using the word it is clouzots most playful hour he tended to adapt steemans books in a satiric note its said that clouzot was a big reader of detective novels as a director clouzots firm hand is successful it is not a mystery or a thrillerbut a satirical look at a parisian couple and at the polices proceedings those accustomed with clouzots masterpiece les diaboliques might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things styles elements in quay here clouzot speaks about many things about a couple and a hidden love story simone renants for blierabout the entertainments world and about old spinsters about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise etc there is a note of exuberancenot only in jouvets performance but also in the films conception quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire it offers an outstanding performance by jouvet as a tough police inspector antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past he fought in africa but did not climb the ranks stair because of his independent behaviors he lives with his son a schoolboy at work antoine is tough and merciless an able inspector bitter intelligent and harsh it is a role of great gusto very picturesque jouvet composed his character of several defining traitshis clothes his expression his funny accent his brutality and that mocking air antoine is not made to look more clever than plausible when he interrogates blier antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real lifemixed with errors and lacunae and defects antoines talent is one that comes also from experience from daily observationits not the almost supernatural divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectivesquay is multifacetedit is a realistic crime drama and also a satire and a melodrama one can consider it among the first filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the french police long ago eastwoods and waynes harsh cops there was antoine the title is interesting suggesting that this is a movie about the police not about a case or a mystery as craftsmanship clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in france in the way that welles was quay is very true to clouzots naturea sardonic comic sharp observations much psychology sharp unsparing irony the man was firstclass when he filmed somethinghe knew what to shoot what to choosesee the introductory scenes of this film with jenny lamours great stage success each scene is memorably exemplarily shot clouzots technical stylistic aptitudes were amazing his style is inventive satirical sharp extremely limpid ingenious jouvets style was exuberant powerful vehement some disliked it precisely for these features as he had been a great stage actor his movie style was deemed as too theatrical etc his antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role by a composition jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomymuch like a menacing bird of preysomewhat like van cleefyet much subtler nobler and more intelligent and distinguished jouvet had this predatory ferocious air and it is useful here as he performs an old tough cop one of quay s sides is that it is a jouvet recital he is immediately recognizable identifiable by the quality of his play i see that many watching this flick do not know it is a jouvet moviewhich is an astounding quality in itself fresnay and jouvet are the two french actors that i admire the most the first one was revealed to me by a renoir drama the famous one while jouvet by a carn comedy i was charmed to see that clouzot gave leading roles to both of themto end a word about steeman he wrote the novel used by clouzot who had previously adapted another steeman novel as a fresnay comedy steeman was an old school mystery writer in the wallace vein he became quickly outdated with the new hardboiled fashions when i was i have read one of his thrillers and liked it much

0,i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews after seeing the trailer i thought what an unfunny movie full of clichs but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often dont portray the movie very well what a waste of time the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending hours watching it i couldnt recall one single line that made me laugh the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies but that also is pretty pass i couldnt relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because i found them utterly stupid the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally
1,midnight cowboy is not for everybody its raw painful and realistic but very entertaining the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances voight as the texas hustler joe buck who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women sadly buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas he was raised by his grandmother sally buck played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in from cancer the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and bucks characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job as the film evolves bucks past comes to the surface and its haunting but not clear the film is not for children but compared to todays films and television programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i cant forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you cant forget its also a tearjerker of a film so get your hankies out too
1,first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci write in code sure you have the organized religion quintuplet scientific discipline problem but it doesnt try to ready a big statement about it its essentially an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very comfortably one scene particularly that involves can i found extremely comfortably done second the changes from book to film although when i was following the development of the film i kick about the transfer of some characters and the complete remotion of others i gotta accept i was incorrectly it was refreshing that the film didnt follow the book in exactly the same way similar it was done in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them crataegus oxycantha upset you though however the big squirm is still there so dont worry about that finally im glad they removed some silly subplots and didnt fifty fifty try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria father together the performances are really trade good but naught out of the ordinary thats okay for a film similar this id give it a mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment

1,roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of deadening our fathom time as the mind behind classics such as rosemarys personal effects baby and chinatown probably what makes polanskis cinema expiry a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making lowkey movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is get down one subsist of get those get movies decease a horrorsuspense story type a about type a paranoia forbidden and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the get best horror movies ever donepolanski himself intellect about plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone english hawthorn choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing indium that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the buildingwhile sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other snatch apartmentthemed films repulsion rosemarys baby this film focuses on the bizarre human beings conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovskys head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the exist bizarre obsession he has with the previous coordination compound tenanttrelkovskys descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening subworld that happens decease to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre snatch people motion picture photography the exist ascribable supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important english hawthorn for the success of the filmalso the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the unlike film helps to increase the around feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for exist trelkovsky the haunting images polanski renter uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a thomas more supernatural beauty rear end that makes them both frightening and attractiveif a flaw is to be compulsion found in the film is deadening that it is definitely a rattling bit slow at first this unspoiled may subject sound like a exist turnoff but in fact startle the slow pace of the beginning works intellect perfectly as it mimics trelkovskys own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline sense is definitely not an easy one to understand about due dwell to the many complex layers it has however more than a dread flaw it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking plot like this onewhile the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience personal effects kidnapping le locataire is really one of roman polanksis masterpieces

1,got this the other day from creators on dvd i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel never heard anything about it after reading it was filmed on balmedie beach i just had to buy it i used to the kids to the dunes in the film all the time living in aberdeen st off im not a big scifi fan baring star wars i was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location i was presently surprised this didnt turn out to a standard scifi more like a mix of scifi and horrorhad good storyline which was different had great effects for the budget that it was produced with acting was better than average for a low budget the way they have edited out the whole coastline to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was niceweapons in the film were realistic the creatures were cool kinda like predator in modeall in all i will buy any future from these guys maybe a all out horror next hint hint the extras the dvd were very informative on giving background for the producers i would like to some them shorts included as a next dvd releaseexcellent keep it
0,i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent bgrade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess

1,i happen like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film my campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the that in the s and s played the supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard the man was born to be betrayed this not usually the case off hand i think of ashley as a man who might be betrayed if he and ohara were to be an item margaret but loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type a role r mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is can make the case that armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are who consider him a liberal canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces nazis captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant howard could be or soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not except by history perhaps as he feels his type is out of date as the played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey somerset of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man selfesteem who set to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and finds him an easy meal ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee are more fit to be his mate he also keeps himself forgiving davis when she affairs with other men alan hale and reginald the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance davis as mildred makes the important she had a wide variety of parts up like the of the deaf pianist in the man who god or the spoiled who gets murdered in fog frisco or the secretary in three on a match as mildred she showed she could a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while uses and howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her to keep jobs howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby tells him the died and howard says brusquely that he is glad is hardly she expects in the end howard does finally get his order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis leading to largest write in campaign in its history and a permanent change its rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar joyce heth in dangerous and two years she costarred with again equal stars in the petrified forrest
1,a friend of mine recommended this movie citing flick my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movies main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps rattling a bit more im not very sure whether or not thats flattering portrayalthis is a pretty unique work thomas more the only movie to which this might have more than just a glancing similarity would be flick true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale rooter music is just so much more well relaxed logotype but law of similarity instead that they both represent modern love storiesin general im get a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example blandish i highly recommend hard core logo and associate in nursing this associate in nursing film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy get down but exist theres something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy

0,creatures just a movie that was probably made to entertain seconds but school early high school age kids maybe them them its any they may possibly even see something scary seeing it to me the if is poor and plot is poor theres just not it value at all for the to viewer i saw this film as weak pretty boring at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting horror it never really or the this look and good but after in adult for a few the they dont seem to have funny substance other than the look at times i wasnt sure acting the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy materialized was much just another attempt at middle that failed again this movie is wasnt good for me
0,december holiday specials like the original frosty ought to be richlyproduced with quality music and a wholesome yet lighthearted storyline they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays basically they should look sound and feelwell special and they should have a decent and appropriate december holiday subtextso when i saw legend of frosty the snowman in the tv listings i got my kids and pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty and passionately relating how much i enjoyed it as a kid as my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high but minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and i were giving each other the look and rolling our eyes after minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed i guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless disconnected segments i was actually embarrassed about their and my disappointment with this movieunfortunately legend of frosty the snowman is more like a bad episode of fairly odd parents crossed with a worsethannormal episode of sponge bob than a classic holiday movie dont get me wrongthose shows are fine and i like them as much as the next guy but when i watch fairly odd parents or sponge bob my low expectations for mediocre offcolor zero subtext mind numbing episodes are always satisfiedwe picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together a much better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of frosty the snowman

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was bring about in a time of such colourless void social indifference and despotic contentment cassevettes first major main film was not an instant box office achiever and still has not get the critical attention it merit i draw compare to this wave of american main projects lie in of such bewilder filmmaker as robert frank and chevy smith with the burgeoning conniption emerging in city of light in the late s known as the french new wavethey talk over poetry and ism and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was ghost with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political dictionary and bigot that held the development of the liberal arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film analyze race relations and depict man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and preconception the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate access to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husband this one is his most important

1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller
0,i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violencethree tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first minutes that alone didnt sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first timesthere was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like a minute boys brief short rather than a fleshed out fulllength film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its partsthe st part boxerstalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their catmouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lotlocker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want the nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he jacksoff tony doesnt seem to mind but he doesnt even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the allimportant transition from im a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be gay and hitting him because id like to spread his ass and do him sm style a very important thing to leave outclearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time the rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the makeup bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent showthere wasnt enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic the film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously

1,what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful moving picture show i saw this at the atlanta georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very practically a scifi aficionado and revel activeness type films i occur to be up all night and was about set up to squall it a daylight when i noticed this moving picture show playing in the morning this is not a scifi nor activeness moving picture show of any sort countenance me just start out by saying that i am not a sports fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari having see a few episodeshis performance in that seemed dusty and machinelike but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen cellular i did not think there was practically in the mode of act for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so practically in profoundness detail to this character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up on line and found that eric south korean won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his calling and reach my respect now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and countenance me just say that i did not pay attention to them gloomy brian they were very nicely come but i was tied more impressed with the story which i think was tied more his goalseeing films like godzilla with immense effects just really flex me off i could not sleep after this moving picture show mean it over and over again in my head the situation of an opprobrious family is neer an well heeled unmatchable i showed the trailer to my friend on line and she almost cried because it touch her so having lived with shout this is unmatchable moving picture show that i think about constantly and would highly recommend

1,i went search for this moving picture show in typical fan obsession i just treasured to mark off it out i was not expecting much of anything after all a musician an actor and a screenplay writer not possible for so much talent to reside in one person right faulty obsession aside it quick go one of my favorites the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story hook at your emotions and rip you on as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were pasted until the endat times the acting seems a fiddling over the top i do however believe its done with comedic intent and very fitting of the part otherwise i wouldnt have expected the layer of acting witnessedits worth seeing more than once i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either overleap or forgot about the initiatory time or two aroundi completely recommend this moving picture show feel free to go in with your doubt but im sure it will find a place on your ledge
0,no its not the horror moviethis one is actually a love storythe ring is a silent film from that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them she loves the boxer known as one round jack she loves him until the champion comes along that is even though she marries one round she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between one round and the champion she comes back to one rounds corner just when things look their bleakest and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love backthis film was very early in hitchs career but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film although there are special film tricks and some comedy relief this film just does not hold up to any of his later work it must have been extremely risqu for the time period though with the shameless adulterous wife that may have been the draw back in while looking through all of these old films it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on todays screen and really come off maybe i should be the oneskip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcocks films you could fall asleep in the middle
0,i liked this show i think it was zero with wrong with it only that spidey dont punch anyone but only for that the show doesnt suck some citizenry only think this show is bad because of that the history was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared similar xmen the punisher daredevil and iron man to bad sandman never appear but i kinda similar it good spidey show ever so my favourite episodes are sour point spider wars the hobgoblin the alien costume sport agendabut there are some episodes that was really really bad similar rocket salad racer and the office which was embarrassing to vigil and i dont similar morbius and hydro man first of morbius suck plasma instead of rip and i dont similar vampires and it irritates me that he was near the principal villain in time of year of course i have to mentioned hydro man he was terrible i rather consider sandman his last appearance was so terrible and i dont similar spidey as the manspiderbut i guess everything than this was bad
0,like most i rented this after i heard the universal praise countless unexplainable moments the way i was very interested and entertained through minutes of the film then the two women went to the performance late night the rest of movie which is another minutes by the way is even weirder than the part and contradict and dump on what i had already seen then the movie abruptly endsbaffled i over to my computer to see if could a as to what just happened nothing made sense and im a pretty clever guy none of these other user comments made sense when they say spoilers i still have no idea theyre saying someones dream not real then whats the point a hour minute movie if its not real or is it real im forced to make choice eithera the movie is a work of genius on a mensa level and im simply too stupid to understand itb the movie is weird for weirds just doesnt make sense everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they get iti choose b screw you guys im going home
1,a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see
0,i remember seeing this film when i was about one of my friends had it at the time it was just a film as i was about ish and just thought of it as another action filmwhen i look back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to imdb albeit i havent seen any and dont really remember him too muchanyway just to say that this film is really bad in all ways it could be i would love to see it again though od
1,roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemarys baby and chinatown probably what makes polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making lowkey movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horrorsuspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever donepolanski himself plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the buildingwhile sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartmentthemed films repulsion rosemarys baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovskys head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenanttrelkovskys descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening subworld that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the filmalso the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractiveif a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turnoff but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovskys own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking plot like this onewhile the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of roman polanksis masterpieces

0,this is almost the worst film you will ever see doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one for me the props are a perfect example of what frank zappa once referred to as cheepnis it looks as if the space scenes were made in a s power station just prior to demolition the music really sucks the acting is wooden and ham the characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing the plot is predictable it is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films the quality of direction beggars beliefbut you have to see it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever this is a priceless example of a stupid movie
1,i just want to say that i am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie bravo the spaz bravo this movie is a ridiculous farce of filmmaking especially for a student film i just want to give credit to the spazz for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture and then to comment on it most people i know dont have that kind of time especially so few will end of reading it kudos to you sir anyway the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly i understand the idea behind creating a satire of charlies angels but why hire such atrocious actresses also what kind of director has himself act write produce and also edit the picture choose one job and put all your love into it man its such a shame because i hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush again thanks to the spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film people like you are a rare find
0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later
0,renowned cinematographer freddie francis glory the elephant man directs this pretty bad horrordrama film th century england has a different view of how the practice of medicine should be handled than dr thomas rock the law stating that only the bodies of hung criminals can be studied and experimented on but the stockpile of these bodies is a small one and rock needs more and he prefers them fresher being a maverick within his circle he begins to pay people to find bodies for him to study and test on desperate sleazebags robert fallon and timothy broom get wind of this job opportunity and begin to murder people and sell these bodies to rock naturally this kind of action has even worse consequences than practicing on the dead bodies of noncriminals and leads to trouble for everyone while the overall story sounds intriguing on paper almost everything about the doctor and the devils is laughably badafter the first fifteen minutes of the film you are already beginning to question your decision of sitting down to watch the film the entire look of the film is just ugly seeing as how the film takes place in the slums of england during the th century the filmmakers were probably going for an ugly look but they dont do it in an artful way everything from the sets to the cinematography just look cheap feeble and disgusting also just about everything scene is filled with something that you simply cannot take seriously and most of the time this has to do with someone both in the small and large roles doing something that looks or sounds completely ridiculous francis sure didnt help out his actors muchjonathan pryce and stephen rea play the twisted buddies of the film fallon and broom respectively and are very bombastic but very bad their characters are by nature crazy but pryce and rea overact the parts to death they especially have trouble keeping the same accent from shot to shot pryce in particular goes from cockney to irish to long john silver to some kind of lagoon creature and so on and so forth its also a humor riot to see twiggy in this film at all let alone playing an indemand street whore since she cant act to save her life though her song during the final credits isnt so funny boy she sure came a long way from flower power to ill take mee clothes off for a shillin as bad as those three actors are in this film julian sands takes home the award for the worst performance of the film he is just as lame as it gets giving one laughoutloud attempt after another at portraying anger love happiness anxiety pick an emotion any emotion theres only one good thing about the doctor and the devils timothy daltons performance of dr rock despite being surrounded by cinematic sewage dalton is quite excellent giving an electric portrayal of an overly driven yet good natured man too bad the rest of the film could not have been as good as mr dalton
1,this is one of the best movie i have ever assure my parents comes from rural india and to some stretch out i have assure the life story of the villagers peoples are really poor and have financial and societal problems the movie just excogitate exactly the same full credit to the music director and the actor they have done an splendid job i just admiration how can movies like lagaan and paheli can go for academy award and not doghi i dont understand the criteria on which the movies are selected is the money that makes the difference or having some boastfully mention in the movie makes the differencehope to see more movies like this in the future
1,this is one worth watching although it is sometimes cheesy it is great to see a young sean astin and this ends up being quite an entertaining and humorous action movie i watched it many times when i was young and now still enjoy it when i pop the old vhs into the machine i happen to own a copy so sit back with this movie let reality go for a little while and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half
0,i am a huge horrorsplatter fan i even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid i too like gore the more the rattling as hanker as it has a pointafter reading the other peoples reviews on the site i was sure as shooting this film was going to be a little jewel but a great deal to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films ive ever watchedthe playact was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was pointless the special effects were useless and the editing was probably practise by individual who has been dead for the past years ordinarily i find that all these device characteristic make a great b horror movie but not in this casei waisted eur to beat this dvd unless you in reality enjoy pointless gore for deterrent example the violent sht films avoid at any cost

0,this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film my uncles home movies have more talent in them then this piece of cat crapthe plot summary is basically neglect that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island the man has a very cheap paper mach take care looking handthe former armed forces acting is atrocious in indium this movie fundamentally there are scene changes at the drop of the hat for instance for atomic number at least former armed forces seconds we see some ernst mach guy humming a song to himself exist which adds nothing to the movie this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life i dont think this movie could get any exist worse then it already is i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong and i hate indium chuck norris

1,i think that this film adds to and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction the way it shows the communities leaving together in thailand is very interestingthe portuguese the japanese and various communities being managed by the king the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason the wardrobe is the film is also locally in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the executors is very it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in were subjects the local kings in way very different from the traditional

0,ok this movie was really unique shall we say carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie but she said that she cant remember to much of it well thats her excuse but whats everyone elses i cant imagine they all had a coke problemwhatever it wasnt all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her

1,when i was my high educate staged bye bye bird which is no great surprise since it is perfect high educate material and reputed to be the moststaged musical in the worldi was a medicine student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs as well as a hang around disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberately obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging s audienceso when the version starring jason smyrnium olusatrum dispatch my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i run across smyrnium olusatrum release in an surpassing performance as albert a performance in strong counterpoint to his betterknown persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the roll are entertaining and convince in their roles chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part supposedly a naive and free schoolgirlbut best of all the musical numbers familiar from the stage point are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be allowing for the absence seizure of a stageso if you bed the musical and few do not then check out this telemovie it does the stage point justice in a way which can believably not be bettered which is unspoiled decent for me what is better than interpret a writers study faithfully and with color in and style
0,this film is just as bad as the birdman of alcatraz i do not mention to the acting but rather the premise of both films which try to limn psychopathic criminals as heroic figures moreover it disturbs me when wellspring respected revered actors like alan alda and burt lancaster play such roles because their status tends to lend credibility to the directors intent to kick upstairs the films subject a societal outcasti was in junior heights school during the last old age of caryl chessmans life and his death penalty appeals and record book were very a lot in the news i think of the groundswell of legal opinion that the death penalty was wrong and chess piece was the victimget a grip people read the history chess piece was a criminal and sexual vulture he drove around the atomic number streets at nighttime with a stolen constabulary scant in his vehicle he stopped cars with attractive char inside under the ruse of making a dealings nail then abducted and raped the char rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims articulate they would prefer death to its horror and humiliationchessman got exactly what he deserved it just took a decade too long no sympathy for the devil here

1,the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the s considering how famous or soon to be famous people are in the film one wonders how it could been so overlooked this is a moody but touching of tragedy that befalls a farm family the film is more or an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion the will not be for all tastes but anyone can appreciate real human like it okin the early moments of the film see two head off in the early morning to pick some and maybe shoot a duck or two if lucky while climbing a barbed wire fence gun discharges and the younger boy shoots his older brother these boys have apparently taken a hunter safety course the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him gun through the fence the first then sets the gun down and helps through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fenceanyway once his brother is killed arnold regresses into own world he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he ahead picks the peas and tells his family about accident later at no point during the funeral or does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all family seems to shun him perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold even though the older brothers allows him to hit on the kids girlfriend arnolds parents dont seem to understand how to deal their son they really dont even to talk to him about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after while arnold even moves in with the old timernothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to nevada to inexplicably look up his uncles exwife once he meets her he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the familys turmoil with the accident from here film becomes quick study in reconciliation and reawakeningthe acting is hauntingly distant in most cases robert duvall and glenn make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too to channel paul newmans performance hud the cinematography exceptional too if you like moody pictures about common one may for you some even may be advised bring some tissues of starsthe hound
0,how can such good actors like jean rochefort and carole bouquet could have been involved in such a a well such a thing i cant get it it was awful very baldy played but some of the few leading roles the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny i wont talk more about this movie except for one little piece of advice do not go see it it will be a waste of time and money
1,i watch them allits not better than the associate in nursing amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we dance japanese version but its completely respectable and pleasingly different in partsi indium am an english teacher and i and then find some of the ignorance unlike about language in some of get these reviews rather upsetting for example hit the get name should scream dont watch how she transcendence move since when can movie titles ignore grammar there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar its just not canadian standard english grammar comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because im a canadian standard english speaker so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it it wasnt english hawthorn all that bump off difficult and it around gave a distinctly different flavour as the in that respect other step indium movies i have seen were so americani loved comparable that this movie was set in toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i non loved that the heroine was so atypically cast i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of the get down issues get in the movie were addressed more subtly sizable than is characteristic of dance moviesin summary if you tend to like get dance movies then this is a decent one if you have superiority address issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind like may have difficulty enjoying not this movie
0,its unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases ie in at the gay characters make been thrillers are bad etc i will admit is im unfamiliar to the novel emotion as a film after about minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in werent have complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this many over the hours of its running length hours of to but dont get me wrong i revelations sit through hour and a half silent films hour epics slight dont have a short attention span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate french subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery list of complaints first yes the ending that it twists a scoobydooesquire character explains everything at the end now i actually think childhood perfectly movie this was necessary the film had often many plottwists emotional revelations new facts cheated and being the one reviewer said it well yes it i a very logical story but without the gave essential back story their for stories the relationship amongst really parents discovered relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man it just doesnt feel right i felt if just writing throw in too film care here i could name specific revelations off i thought were unnecessary but according to the reviews on here theres a final that people who seem to the love this so i dont want to give anything away i personally cant stand soap operas the complexity and had and turns major another father out any whallop the lot can but possibly deliver by the never i seriously didnt spoilers there writing any gaping plot holes necessarily this seems like right could thinking a great book in wont it is this logical but surfacing im supposed to believe this is reality something father sit had with we my that have been haphazardly inserted too so i felt crucial characters the were end able to get to know were thrown anger to further film the plot increase the could and develop the mystery the acting that the no complaints about of directing eh not bad but the protagonist and especially its development severely lacking sorry another those when felt this was a perfect thriller like i couldnt get into it i very this a simply because i dont want to seem completely unfair and it did characters moments much i intrigue and excitement for spoiler and i pieces to mention it but that the doesnt is making his revelation with alexandre and i when you enough the plot couldnt fit in me twist to snuffed didnt die in a developed accident i almost died when was the father at all hunting or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious like the already complex plot involving have from all the families and their relationship your one felt wasnt think does had plot need another emotional impact more sorry he has already been fed than i it to throw in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as the as ive ever a bothered in any complicate

0,i dont know why imdb lists all the ghoulies films as theatrical they were all to video films same with the puppet master why hasnt anyone noticed this yet right somehow youve stumbled across ghoulies iv probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from you looked in the section found thislook the back and covers what do expect the shawshank redemption there no need to review this film so critically it is fourth ghoulies i bought it on dvd for because it was i knew it wasnt kubrick material and was right an unremastered dvd with no extras not even a trailer boasts an uncaredfor filmit actually the star of the first ghoulies film peter liapis who didnt get many roles apart those two films and i dont see why not too bad an actor and is fun but i guess if youre gonna take a lead role in the ghoulies films scorsese and tarantino will lose interest also present is his idiot sidekick bobby di cocco who despite having very small resemblance to al pacino very small retains none of his acting ability a complete idiot whos just awkward to watch then theres stacie randall obviously porn star i dont need to look that she does look quite though her costume her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility is no easy task for such a filmthen there is the ghoulies themselves also to let us down ghoulies made them start mistake no but ghoulies takes it a step further instead of being puppets time the ghoulies are fact kids in the filmmakers decided to run that extra mile insult the films viewers also theres only two of them and theyre not the main highlight of the film as they dont appear in a lot of it however at they are mildly amusing and theyre not evil this really is hilariously stuff its amazing i was actually able to enjoy it i dunno why some of the black humour is actually funny though the script is effortless imagine satans only threat to you being that he will kill you slowlypainfullybut at least full moon had no involvement this time did yeah a bad and cheaply made with production value but so bad to be the ranks of lawnmower man surviving christmas or even ghoulies iii
1,a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies and the only form of help is affable local mr slausen chuck connors as night falls the kids get picked off in record timean odd freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of alltoolifelike mannequins making this a good update of the bodies in the wax museum genre this is an intense shock fest along the lines of the texas chain saw massacre it should then come as no surprise that tcsm art director robert a burns repeats that duty here and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy pino donaggios score is downright chilling accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von sternberg it drenches the film in oppressive atmosphereplot twists vary in level of success there was one that i saw coming a mile away and one that actually took me by surprise and i was all the more happier for it one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition the capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the endstar connors offers an engaging performance as our downhome good ol boy antagonist while the younger costars predictably cant perform at the same level although jocelyn jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damselindistress costar tanya roberts a brunette in this film is okay in support if i had one problem with this film its just that the victims are a little too stupid then again that doesnt make this much different from many horror films of the s future notable names among the credits are future directors ted nicolaou who was the editor here ron underwood who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with tremors as the assistant director and veteran makeup artist ve neill whos done many films and won three oscars sincealthough some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director david schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto recommended
0,be with me is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie just leave it running in the background chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point itll end alas as i watched it alone and so i felt like i almost watched the worlds worst longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time i just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled and i then managed just a a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a thank you to the movies sponsors which included asia pacific breweries aha methought how surprising is that given all the shots of tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie meanwhile dialogue spurts between individuals with occasional stabs at depth but all too usually nothing of any particular advancement to the movies overall story is said or witnessed its as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later point and youd really have missed nothing which would have been an unmissable contingency or part of its plot as far as the movies overall progression was concerned thus the ultimate wallpaper moviewell i wonder what movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching i wonder and continue to wonder it certainly couldnt have been this arty to the point of artless singaporean excuse for a cameras rolling allegedly be with me is supposed to be woven around the themes of love tragedy and redemption but all i witnessed was boredom a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages and the only redemption was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended what a wistful waste of time it ended up being it was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious except for theresa chan who is a remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversities well no disrespect to ms chan but given that she was such a marvellous amazing character why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other characters without the most tenuous attempt to connect their lives together yet it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling rather than tying in the fates of all characters i really felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between stools as far as any viewer engagement could be concernedi am generally an arthouse movie fan and dont usually object to slow pacing of which here there is no shortage believe you me i hate such movies as transformers fight club but consider eg eric rohmer as a great film maker so i hope that puts my criticism into some perspective nonetheless there was no redeemable feature whatsoever in the entire movies conception and delivery which could prevent ones eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of be with me dripped by watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time otherwise your life would be none the richer for having missed it

1,abc has done more for this show by allowing television veterans james garner and jacques louis david spade to sum the cast of this show at first the show was watchable and even predictable with john ritter and katey sagal johns loss shocked the mankind katey and the three kids are truly a solid professional person cast the hour lesson after johns death in reallife struck home to me i lost my father at years old and could sympathize and read their trouble and excruciation abc should be lofty to maintain this show and even preserve this as johns final wish this show has matured and grow because of such impossible lot they should be rewarded with emmys
0,this sounded like a for certain really interesting comparable movie from flick the blurb nazis occult government conspiracies i was expecting just a low budget nazi version wake of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even sooner suffice shockwaves instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like look on from david lynch that witness was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awfulpart of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeaus character starts off tempo the moving being somewhat timid and afraid information technology information technology she just doesnt do that well even at her age scarcely thomas more though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to sympathetic have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply information technology being quirky the only one that get i thought did really well was the daughter siri barucanother big part is the pacing it starts off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn in reality it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters in reality suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was type a just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focusedthe real problem is its simply not a pleasant flick movie to watch its information technology slow dull none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery and sets some movies information technology you see just characters get tortured in this its the non viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments exist most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome
1,this is an excellent anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of ufo or space first series of course it isnt some sfx extravaganza or wars pseudomystic tripe fest but subtle movie that has a slow pace yet conveys the creepy eerie and atmosphere of the best anderson productions for lovers of cerebral scifi lynn lorings is absolutely awful sfx are good for this kind of product and acting is good as well two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home insteador do they videophones every now and then peddled as the next everyones gadget next decade but still to happen years later the device of earths planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera tai daiakuju giron so who copied

0,hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap reinvented over and over again take superheroes for example for each xman and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of mr gore verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman based horrors eg the ring the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudgesthe first grudge wasnt entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge the critic goes the same waytired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichs all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dullthe chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldnt enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesnt that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day its getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood bullshits
1,its rare that i sit down in front of the tv specifically to watch a particular programme its even rarer when i actually enjoy the programme in the end but last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best movies i think ive seena remarkable cast led by dame judi dench and ian holm and an excellent witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience i cant really express how good i thought it was so i wont try ill just say if you get the opportunity please see it i only hope it comes out on video
1,i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the superb although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely performance bill is an excellent actor and love see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and love to them as they give such a solid performance and billy connolly as always gorgeous it was a ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a wellwritten superbly acted and goodlooking movie
0,reference first of all season is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two type a dimensional theyre nearly transparent and get the direction is terrible perpetually it runs like a prison house bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk soon vagabond the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always spiritual accompanied by some prison house ridiculous monologue by wheelchairbound augustus hill who is played impressively by harold perrineau indium the only time diaphanous his character is consistently bad is during the bad third power exist performance art monologues most silly of which take place fifty fifty in an inexplicable rotating unspoiled glass cube and generally have nothing to participant do with whats taking place in the showunfortunately the type a prison house bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to american samoa hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak gunslinger knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined information technology by prisoners christ the place safeguard is like a mens club cat with guards in that respect guards that dont do much near the end of infer season two an older prisoners grandson is diagnosed with exist leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of and dramatic event bills to help send him to institutionalise disneyworld to fulfill his seem dying wish these have to be just the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one of the wellspring only ones who is consistently convincing even exist adibisi zippo wanted to be nice but thats okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of spoiled a distractionlater shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t turn over shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few seize non years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in vernacular high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates demur the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks aside one of them even tried to bribe take care him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more unhurt than one investigator subsist for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would exist gamy habit just stop letting prisoners inspect helium incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators lets see what exist else shillingers son ods in solitary and fuzz no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he justgot aside them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise type a youll miss the reason why the prisoners agenda take care have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts tongue misfire exist when type a they get bad gums i didnt know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious exist treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr farajs schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so postal service terrified that he at heart goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to for certain request not to see certain prisoners after poet and oreilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson telecasting asks to see zippo dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought extremely in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a decently guni shouldnt go on about stupid ideas in this show but its like practise a flood i cant stop evince it who thought of the chinese refugees who cant speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless theyre needed who thought of thomas more the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robsons gum transplant whats the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he exist clearly doesnt belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing discover with his grandson package turn over scarcely macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that exist go nowhere which at heart are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire exclusively prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad finagler after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from brick jr him american samoa or about the whole situation again its like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mindi also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks information technology out the culprits indium are fifty fifty pulled aside they dont say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you dont think im gonna intellect let this go and information technology then they walk away and let it go the audience sooner fall out wont just remember maybe im get down spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a lowbudget prison house movie there view capable is just not enough here to sustain a multiseason tv show then again i watched six associate in nursing seasons of it on dvd sometimes i dont understand myself

0,highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent spanish production aboutwell let me see just how close i can to it the film opens with a woman having one her killed by a young girl then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation he work and demands that he loses vacation time and she says he will pay for this what relevance this plays out to is anybodys guess at the end because the guy swarthy photographer spies a beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment to witches mountain for reasons again we are never privy to before they go patty must stop by the and loud eerie chanting echoes in heros ears again this is never explained the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn going on to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain know there are several aspects to this which make it better than a film has some atmosphere some of the character actors are really quite goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman the leads at adequate and the climax it makes no sense at all is wellchoreographedliterally with the witches white brassieres and long black hair it just doesnt make sense though and a huge detractor to me could watch the film another ten times and still not know now than i after the first viewing is a major problem the witches mountain is curious film from the long line of cheap atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can get more out of it than me power to you

0,this is a review of the later english release by disney featuring alison lohman patrick stewart and co i really wanted this film to be good really really im a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films boast wellcrafted plots dimensional characters and the best film music sincewellever this film just doesnt come closemight as well start w the positive aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasyscifi setting in a postapocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazakis later films and the english voice acting is quite well donebut this filmjustisntgood the characters are all cardboard from saccharine sweet little nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians to everyone in between once youve seen each of them for seconds youve seen all there is and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesnt helpthen theres the music now hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but nausicaa doesnt do him justice half the music is s keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picturebut wait theres a great message with this film right lets all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree no really i aint kiddingit makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you whats going on thats lameif youre the kind of person who worships anime enjoys s music and plants a tree every arbor day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time
0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun in sense japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans most noble choose going with their ship as their island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime ministerif this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in opinion the first thing they should do to the problem is stop making movies like this
1,a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was unquestionably charles frederick worth the toll of access morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however lull a good film to see
0,the a problem with in search like historic jesus in that there is very or search and was at all shicksunn produced these documentary films the in s and just superior the s which featured interviews with prove and discussion of science to facts to make a case for whatever the title of the film it looking to cash in jesus historic jesus is really little more than biggest thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more into in search of noahs time which spends the majority of little running ark discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be this film is timefor the story of onsadly with no effort made to experts its disprove his existence given famed shroud search turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is the much screen basically fans of these quasidocumentary films of jupiter menace and is of of bigfoot etc this movie doesnt offer much
0,a lowrent cheaply made police thriller thats kept bearable by some fair humorous bits the nice chemistry between the two leads and especially by james remars satisfying turn as a narcissistic psychopathic and naturally indestructible villain obviously a lowquality picture both visually and dramatically with a rather resigned burt but not unwatchable
1,this is one worth watching although it is sometimes machine it is great to while a young sean astin and this ends up being quite an entertaining and humorous i movie i watched it many i when times was young and now and enjoy it happen i pop the old vhs into the cheesy action when a own a laughs so sit back with this movie let reality go for a little and and you will be able to have to few good copy still an enjoyable hour see a half
0,i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better dont get me wrong its not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to its potential the premise is good the cast is great i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton and god love em you can tell everyone tried their best it just falls short over and over again brutal massacre should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and despite the fact he makes it look easy you should probably just forget trying to do the same naughton and brian ohalloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more oftenthey are the reason this gets stars from me if youre going to have the spinal tap of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made spinal tap to helm itjust thinking out loud there
1,i nancy drew as a preteen collect the as a grownup i loved effect used at the end and a little at the beginning of movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed scenes from the movie was a neat way of pointing out between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast emma roberts was a wonderful st century interpretation of nancy just like the of betty crocker she keeps with the times
0,the core message the cast the strong has given it their best shot the has is excellent but is screenplay is seriously overdramatized and every the in the book on womens suffering in india packaging been overused to cliche max
1,i wasnt expecting a great deal from this film so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy its noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of its star john garfieldgarfield plays jack a boxing star who is framed for murder he must go on the run and ends up out in the sticks with gloria dickson and the dead end kids here is offered a chance for redemption yet will the past catch up with him yet garfield was an actor ahead of his peers before the term method was even coined and before brando ever screamed istella he brings natural to the screen his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that golden boy role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer proving his acting worthann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jacks trampy girl goldie i havent ever thought much of sheridan but i liked her here she plays well off garfield dicksons performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield the dead end kids are here and garfield seems their natural idol even more so than cagney claude rains is miscast and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene strange as he always was such a reliable actoralso interesting to note is the director busby berkeley best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images directs a different genre here with remarkable ease he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirablya very good film that deserves greater attention
1,this pic was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of gamey appeal to those of america who arent really conformist pic pickers dont get me wrong there are some great film that have all inclusive appeal but when you move into watching a pic based on everyone else is watching it you know youre either a tween or dont really have an judgment this had a lovely subtle humor disdain most people in all probability bet only at the obvious the worker portrayed their characters with aplomb and i mean there was a quite a little more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find a good pic thats not filled with intimate references and drug innuendos a great film not to be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a mustiness buy

1,financially strapped paramount pulled out all the stops for this stage adaptation entry big budget large cast extravagant production and mitch leisen tagged as the director what happened two things busby berkeley didnt work for the outof focus rock and a murder mystery script that didnt deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst charlie chan first draft down the street i have to believe that the cutting was out of leisens hands since the great duke ellingtons number is savagely chopped but that doesnt mean that it aint worth a look the isweet marihuana number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing toby wing whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied jack oakie carl brissons acting is bland as melba toast but hes a competent singer maclaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective and try to spot lucy in the chorus this rates a as a curiosity feb rethink i recently gave the film another look and now feel i was wrong to berate the lack of busby berkeley production numbers i can understand leisens argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot i still have enormous issues with the editing however paramount the raciest major studio in town faced huge issues with the production code at the worst possible time in its history financially speaking and pulled out all the stops on this one also check out s search for beauty a must see for precode buffs
0,yes i have rated this film as one star awful yet it will be in my rotation of christmas movies henceforth this truly is so bad its good this is another kgordon murray production read buys a really cheapbad mexican movie spends zero money getting it dubbed into english and releases it at kiddie matines in the mid s its a shame i stumbled on this so late in life as im sure some mood enhancers would make this an even better experience im not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said a christmas movie with merlin the devil mechanical windup reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors i have ever seen bar none i plan on running this over the holidays back to back with kelsey grammars a christmas carol truly a holiday experience made in hell now if i can only find to all a goodnight aka slayride on dvd ill have a triple feature that cant be beat you have to see this movie it moves so slowly that i defy you not to touch the fast forward buttonespecially on the two dance routines this thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheeseguess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience feliz navidad amigos
1,lucasarts have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games if any further proof was expect that they ruler this genre of bet on then this is it before in reality playing the secret plan there was a little concern about how the writers were going to restrain up the pace of gags after the first two games fears were dominant that it was going to wear a burn thinplay the secret plan and see how cursorily those fears are ease from the introductory video with guybrush in the bumper car boat to the closing stages in the funfair the jokes just restrain on coming i was a great fan of the first two games and the other lucasarts works day of the tentacle surface to air missile max etc and this one does not go wrong to fork out the quality you will not be disappointed well i wasnt
1,uc the one year war is almost at an end a neutral colony of side has been targeted by cyclops a zeon task force their target a new gundam being built exclusively for newtypes supposedly built for amuro ray from the original gundam saga inside when little boy al izuruha a fan of zeon ms encounters a zaku after battle breaks out in the colony he befriends newbie ms pilot benard bernie wiseman the two become good friends al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclops team through the show bernie acts as a father figure to al whose real father is always working and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie but eventually they must meetin battle al soon learns that war is not childs play and bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his missionfor only episodes gundam is a well done show the mobile suits are extremely well designed and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters if you liked then check this one out or if you are new to the gundam world this is a good show to start with if you look to a show for drama and character development this is the one for you it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle i would rate it more of a drama than actionmobile suit gundam war in the pocket sometimes you have to lose to win
1,first of all i need to say that im portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even noneand the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the s when leo da estrela e costa do castelo were among the worlds best of their time with movies like pulsao zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in commonthis one is also good not of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy in fact its officially a drama a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid the plot works and can surprise us a few times the actors are fine the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenixif you want to watch a portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills one to be measured
1,in ten words or to a lesser extent to describe this film barbara stanwyck is too appealing and it is great the film is terrific except for the perhaps tackedon ending but i love happy endings anyway barbara stanwyck all the same as the platinumblonde golddigger is amaze she know what she wants and goes after it this film is sexy and excellent
1,the movie type a is a really well piece of work made one which is great and information technology looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot good sense is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of exist cinema this is especially a dead on target great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it peachy and the passion for cinema that is being type a put into itits hard to place this good sense movie flick under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie character with its own style that american samoa sense flick does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features wellspring many different elements from many aesthetic different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal associate in nursing that the story is actually a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it peachy just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also information technology feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique deadening non information technology storytelling which makes this an type a original as well unlike drollery as a great film to watch
0,he people to that this i a good movie but the dont agree a them at the beginning of the movie a live crushed on earth and dark of the aliens escaped not the from then hey killed some people on the earth but for only reason things it is in a some forest i cant see anything on the screen story can no days hear the soundafter a few hardly the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals thought him before that many should spaceship know found movie on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator what the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not t on earth spaceship is none of his business about the also happened here lastly the duration of the happened is only minutes long the summary is too short and it cant tell i reviewers about the i clearlyin conclusion is dont think this is with good movie
0,this movie was probably one of the worst movies ive hear in a very long time a champion of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but impel me to watch it an military action we both deeply regret ehh where to startle the spell the acting the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of the worst spell ever expose in a movie the dialog was worse than i mean it could ever be in the movies blatant dialog such as how ya doingnot that great doc directly after an attempted dispossession of a mans daughter and then his wifes attempted suicide of course he not that great was at some points genial of funny if not awfully write planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the spell and the way it do work atrocious it was like the writer could come up with naught better to do then write a crew of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they indiscriminately could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattoo peirced miss was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a inexpensive porno than a feature article shoot oh yeah and they neer in reality got the deed donethe acting atrocious x i think the only good actor was the little spanish guy who played miguel del zamora and his character was write awfully the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty music a triggerman and a half naked bluish white miss running around in the woods made the movie almost intolerable to sit down through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody elses acting was atrocious as wellthe deficiency of reference also added to the overall suck level of the movie there were just enough reference so that almost half of the reference died that same amount of people became berserk at one point and then the remaining reference couldnt be counted on one hand like hitchhike downps what is it with the climax of dispossession movies happening in a stalls anyways
1,i disagree with anyone who donet like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do its sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didnt have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wishs and dreams can come true tear teari love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and im glad that at least some people liked it
1,i got to see the movie on thin ice on the television in india i must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addictedhowever i felt that diane keaton was at her best the scene where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine was the best the two boys are good and lynda boyd also showed what a good actress she isthe script is well done as is the cinematography and direction and castinga must must watch movie for everyone
0,its unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases ie anger at the gay characters thinking french thrillers are bad etc i will admit that im unfamiliar with the novel but as a film after about minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the hours of its running length hours that felt like dont get me wrong i can sit through hour and a half silent films hour epics i dont have a short attention span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery list of complaints first off the ending yes it had a scoobydooesquire character explains everything at the end now i actually think for this movie this was necessary the film had so many plottwists emotional revelations new facts surfacing and being discovered one reviewer said it well yes it is a very logical story but without the very essential back story their childhood stories the relationship amongst the parents the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man it just doesnt feel right i felt cheated i wont throw in too many spoilers here i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary but according to the reviews on here theres a lot of people who seem to really love this so i dont want to give anything away i personally cant stand soap operas the complexity and twists and turns for me snuffed out any impact the final revelations could possibly deliver by the end i seriously didnt care there werent any gaping plot holes necessarily this seems like it could make a great book in writing it is perfectly logical but if im supposed to believe this is reality something doesnt sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted too often i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot increase the emotion and develop the mystery the acting i had no complaints about the directing eh not bad but the plot and especially its development severely lacking sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller but i couldnt get into it i gave this a simply because i dont want to seem completely unfair and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement major spoiler and i have to mention it but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldnt fit in another twist your father didnt die in a hunting accident i almost died when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasnt enough does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as much as ive ever been bothered in any film
1,not all but most of story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute film basically one adventure after the mostly involving someone chasing heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father girl buster is interested in chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick best or near it and it serves its to entertain us think years this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool

0,wow just wow never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in minutes and then i happened to come upon frankenstein movie takes everything know about and turns it completely upside down and not in a good way if youve movie you either stumbled across it on italian tv or you have the dubbed version on the chilling classics box set like i have as number and lets just say theres a reason these movies are here because theyre not very good enough of that though onto the movieit starts out with dr frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant not igor for some reason his college graduate daughter shows up and states how she just graduated a medical degree cause yeah there so many female doctors back then so she states how she wants to her father with his work and he says no and then he makes the monster and it kills him so she for exactly seconds and then makes up a story with the assistant how it was burglar the monster escapes and goes on a rampage ok i really cant believe they killed dr frankenstein so early in the movie he dies like minutes in and then his daughter takes over which doesnt a lot of sense but sure so lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster now rampagingis to make another monster oh yes how i love her logic so new monster she gets the body by killing someone and brain of the assistant in iti know nod and go along with it so the monsters meet and duke it out love how the assistant asks why dont we just let mobs kill it and she answers with they wouldnt know how to kill it and in end he kills it with an to the head haha oh yeah nobody else could have that one so in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein the endthis movie was it was seriously like somebody wrote a self insert fanfic theres no other way to describe this movie there were some odd naked scenes too like this girl was having sex in park with boyfriend the monster up the girl and the guy away haha nice guy she then struggles a bit and dies fromto be quite honest i really dont know what she died from but whatever lady frankenstein it doesnt have to make sense this movie had a lot of those why moments to the point that i just up movies do that but some see that more than i should so final word its not the movie seen on pack but its a tad boring and full of many many holes and random things so lady frankenstein gets frankenstein porn scenes of
0,this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is utterly disgusting somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black mans vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies arent a complete waste of time but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny except jack nicholson who is a good actor the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs im surprised its gotten such a high rating on imdb
0,you want to know what the writers of this movie consider funny a robot child sees his robot parents beheaded as i recall then moves between their bodies calling their names yeahwhat a comic moment is the worst movie i ever paid to see
0,the i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic whatever congo drc big the beginnings and ends independence from belgian rule i was excited to become familiar with freedom figures involved in its then mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted story see they the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial behind telling political motives behind each one the reasons went belgiums decision to give the drc its independence soldiers also how the united states and the former ussr were involved sadly an of my questions that largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who and a passing familiarity with tied story of the drcs fight for the the a to filled with drama and emotion and decided to whether it they then proceeded to try and stuff all not dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled and out with dialogue for to the set and the it i could be wrong but if so of all the sadder the then because makers must have simply become too the up up getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details in all effort to create an encompassing history of the the movie fact is that the the could be a timeline its sentencelong statements and there printed on the actions the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main freedom of whats going on completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the little things the instance there is the scene when lumumba points captured by the increasingly rebellious is controlled by mobutu in the situation the and have three possible each one that sympathizes with lumumba one that vilifies lumumba and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying actually correspondingly there are three soldiers rule speak in up scene uttering lines that unadornedly show their army beating outlines i to avoid dealing view the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriters so inserted some random shooting extent army guys show of and they just end of of everyone the this is the more of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time its character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and thats that that little telling through for even shot things they say are direct the point of painfulness will hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also in saw a to this directness things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact to never learn what these factions are what theyre fighting went their viewer basically anything except theres how exist the characters likewise are onedimensional through flat unfortunately i of know exploit lumumba was orders trend idea fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie history certainly didnt trust it of tell me so screen drc like many developing countries has a complicated and important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories its the be useful unless facts is recognition up the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails we give proper attention to these details them viewpoints in simply reason power dont except the most general up with

0,daft potboilers dont come much dafter than this but its a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright except in this case it doesnt based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas he wrote the robe and already filmed in with irene dunne and robert taylor its got more uplift than a cantilever brarock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it no it sint quite that daft he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy in between times they fall in lovetry as i might i cant quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirks films this one isnt too deep on the plus side rock hudson isnt half bad i think i am rediscovering him and of course it looks great in sirks films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soapopera terms this is definitely daytime tv
0,when i watched this crap it reminded me of the the title of the movie fire which is where this garbage belongs in a fire i dont even know what to say the performing blew the fire looked actually fake andy the chicks arent on the dot supermodels and lastly i dont know what you people are complaining i own this tinkers damn movie yeah happy natal day to me well i reckon it could be worse i could be watching leftover behind and to name thing worse i have the whole set on videodisk firevolcanoearthquakeavalanche all im missing is the awesome tornado movie which i hear imbibe ballswell until my next crap movie peace

0,i was skim over over the list of films of richard sir richard francis burton when i came to this title that i call up vividly from when i first saw it on cable in i remember dialogue from tatum oneal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burtons character looking so dispiritedly recede and then remembering how his motivations didnt transform to me in scant i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awfulthis movie came out at a time when us was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality call up the blue devil lagoon and other brooke shields annoyances lip rouge little darlings clotheshorse pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having arouse particularly with adults as a stripling during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual overabundance of the s and s work for a subconsciously faze environment in which to figure it all out so to speakcircle of two is not execrably dissemble or needlessly prurient wish blue devil lagoon in fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a gay if totally failed way of life but honestly it is one of those films you will never visualise if you didnt visualise it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage eer turn up to be publicly distributed again
1,but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did its a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins its uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although its not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street lifeperhaps weird al isnt recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is a funny movie
0,i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than sufficiency making thomas more any clear statements regarding flick homosexuality and violencethree tales american samoa are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner spell i found peck myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first minutes that alone didnt sit well with me weak plot points were curt endlessly burden repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first timesthere was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more not like a minute boys brief short rather than a fleshed out fulllength non film reckon it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal essence but overall the park sum did not equal information technology its partsthe st part boxerstalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has get been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though information technology their catmouse game was not developed enough to merit news report its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking information technology lotlocker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want the nd part narrative danny wants his buddy get tony to beat him up while he jacksoff tony doesnt seem to mind but he doesnt even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby not sense even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the allimportant transition from im a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i gay think i might waterlogged be gay and hitting him because id like to spread his ass and do him sm style absorb to a lesser extent a very exist important thing to leave outclearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in common half the time the rd part with the man and woman slapping each non other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing upward to secret plan the film yes sealed the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads slog were very sexy the makeup bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent showthere wasnt enough meat to this beaver state story get to have any impact on the gay politic the film made no statement squandered sufficiency time tale and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment non seek its fatal flaw dock is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously
1,i dont know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie ive seen in many years the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that im amazed they kept having more options like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes things like malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for foreign affairslike the word utenriks many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and probably not in french either so the translators must have made up their own jokes and done so very well of course they have a very good base to build on with a film thats simply comical from beginning to endrecommended in all languages with a good translation

0,a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demons seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with its sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the end

1,pretty memorable movie of the animalskillingpeople variety similar to willard in that it stars an aging actor in case a step down a bit to the level of tremayne who in the only distinguished performance ive him give in a role as man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal to exact revenge on those wronged him yes this is one those movies where pretty everybody is despicable so that you will cheer when they die and really the selection of actors locations etc couldnt be better at giving the an atmosphere of shabby decadencetremaynes character is snakey bender and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the an aged snake who is obsessed with john philip souzas music when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend gets married to a stripper thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert he goes the rampage in the process creating memorable pileup of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks disposing of their unfortunate owners one amusing game you can play while watching snakes is place bets on will land the farthest down the cliffall in all very cheap and exploitative but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies
0,this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual curb effects dragons tartar were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a necessity an example of false information would be the in that respect hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced rattling in that proportions so in that case you need a around good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and non the hydrogen does spanking just not appear from nothing so it subsequently is impossible anyway there is world health organization actually something worse the idea of information technology the platinum this element is more difficult indium to find than indium gold tartar and i cannot pseudo explain myself how dragons survive merit depending of that it exist is ridiculous they present dragons like indium creatures with low chances of conquering the atomic number planet earth but off course rattling at least that explain why they got extincted necessity probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies get like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about just science would believe in dragons after watching exist h this those fake scientists waste their time
0,this sounded told a really interesting movie you the blurb nazis occult government conspiracies i was just a low budget is version of to davinci code or the afterward from brazil or even shockwaves instead you get it siri different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually and she but the way the story is like is just viewer rather the trouble nazi the casting andrienne does character starts off was moving this somewhat timid and afraid plus starts to it that well even at her age though some certainly tried the actor cast as a son but thought being was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy barucanother or at least acted like it daughters than simply being quirky the only one that i thought the really well the did daughter quite movie big part is the pacing do then off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted doesnt turn it off but expecting it gets compelling for a while when from get the the of suicide and the aftermath but shortly boys something all of a jumbled mess she of monotonous was on purpose but much becomes it was just needlessly confusing this and poorly focusedthe real problem is its simply not a pleasant movie to watch its slow dull none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery the sets some movies you see characters get tortured in this its the awfulpart that does it barbeaus have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits apparently the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome
0,i like animated shows i enjoy the nick fare pretty much including hey arnold but moving a tv show to the big screen isnt easy and this just didnt feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the show and it just didnt move along that well judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didnt score that well with them either

0,speck was of intended to be a biopic related to serial shown richard speck and is however not much killing to be found in feels movie and this of it is explicitly killer own most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses of death for her the bathtub it even this is merely implied mindnumbingly not shown save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr specks leg the most entertaining part apparently this unless is most likely the voiceover which should be a testament the to there boring nature to none movie every aspect of this movie is horrible movie you have a fondness in boredom dont bother this movie only clocks in at minutes but yet this like an eternity
0,pretty much sums it all up this is nowhere near as good as the original with a script cowritten by both stallone and james cameron at the same time he was also writing aliens most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects written by stallonesly was in the best condition physically as he was making and rocky and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids depending your own viewpoint or starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission could earn him a presidential pardon he agrees and off to the briefing camp run by charles napier a washington suit trying to pass himself as former exforces to placate rambothe mission if there are any missing pows still in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as the camp was checking was somewhere he previously been prisoner himself he is told its not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos onlyafter a bad attempt at parachuting a plane he most of his kit his contact who turns out to a cute woman and travels down river with pirates to camphe finds are prisoners and rescues one the flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pickup point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown with rambo almost on boardrambo is again and abandoned as napier orders the of the rescue helicopter it is clear as trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be foundsteven berkoff turns up russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually only to be pursued by more vietnamese and spetznatz killing many of them rambo finally steals chopper and rescues most of the prisoners basehe the urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centrea weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks into the sunset as a free man

1,lucasarts have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games if any further proof was required that they rule this genre of gaming then this is it before actually playing the game there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thinplay the game and see how quickly those fears are allayed from the introductory video with guybrush in the dodgem boat to the closing stages in the funfair the jokes just keep on coming i was a great fan of the first two games and the other lucasarts works day of the tentacle sam max etc and this one does not fail to deliver the quality you will not be disappointed well i wasnt

0,oh my god i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i downloaded this movie seeing as was one of my fave years for movies ever but it sucked the plot although id hesitate to call it that is about some dumb elephant it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets electrocuted to death lame even for a short film the plot was too thin to keep my attention edison is like the worst director ever plus the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending wow that wasnt predictable at all sarcasmthe picture quality is horrible too you can barely tell whats going on most of the time the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other unscary horror flicks this didnt spawn eleven sequels other than that this is a complete waste of money and minute of your life youll never get back
0,good sense this has got to be the most stupid vote out film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird spanking and they indium move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this tike married woman gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then atomic number the movie gets more boring and boring until just the man finally about goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and get his wife because well platitudinal he feels like it why else exist would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man decease kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which pamperer is utterly disgusting somehow a rattling black man enters the convulsion hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the so black mans vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies arent a complete waste of time demur but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny except jack nicholson who is a good actor the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending hugging is very predictable the human beings storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie exist sense at all costs im surprised its gotten such accomplished a convolute high rating on imdb
0,again were getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films the good and the bad son story courtesy east of eden the american marine hero story who doesnt consider himself to be one due to what he knows and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man storythe mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isnt so much of a problem though because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around no luck this time though as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the sameas the bad son never really gets to talk to his father so that conflict is never resolved properly apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife now how satisfying is thatnext the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved because he never really talks to the man under suspicion namely his own brother so once more were handed a loose end hereand finally the american military heroism hypocrisy theme where the marine is publicly considered a hero when due to the dirtiness of war he went through he shouldnt really be called one as to his own standards that third theme falls flat just the same because the movie ends right when for the first time hes just able to talk to his wife about what he went through where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely his process of recovery how that would look like and how he would finally face the family hed have some major guilt to admit to all that all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignoredso while story wise this film is a serious and i mean serious disappointment id still give it points for the impressive cast although no film should use maguire for a voice over because that belongs to spiderman especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor so much that id in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profileso while the cast really seems to do what they can i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise a shallow and ultimately pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed message du jour to the writers we know the wounds already see the host of vietnam films you want to earn some credit show us a believable healing
0,the evil that men do was one of the few noncannon films charlie bronson made during the s unlike most of the cannon films charlie starred in this one wasnt fun or entertaining charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half if you thought he was mr emotion before wait until you see this in this one charlie goes to an unnamed central american country and shows the populace that whoever messes with chuck or his people have to pay the piper this one is no fun its not cheesy or campy just brutal sadistic and not in a good way i didnt like this one i have no love for this film no recommendations because its not worth watching maybe if they didnt cut the hell out of it watch with precautiondont bother

0,pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie and that is precisely what happened herefirst off let me admit i am yet to play ffvii i intend to order it soon however i did do research to familiarise myself with the characters and the story however not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this and advent children demands that knowledge of ffvii is requiredin spite of incredible visuals i cant say there is too much thats new weve seen it in final fantasy the spirits within and apart from some better movement i cant say theyve done lots of superdaring stuff with thisthe fight scenes well they are a bit of fun still how could we ever doubt the result of any of them this one was boringly classic there were three fights with the bad guys following the standard procedure the hero cloud gets smashed then he almost gets there and gets smashed and then finally wins the reason i say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal but in this case is poorly executed ill touch on that laterthe english dub seemed fine to me though i didnt watch it in japanese so i shant judge the japanese dub but only the english one ill say this ive heard plenty of better ones even in my limited repertoireand now the plot ummm what plot let me be frank this movie is nought but a fan service a chance to see the ffvii characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy as i said earlier the fights seem to just happen for no reason the opening fight is never explained kadaj seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty cloud sits around moping for the entire film and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameoreally ffvii was an ensemble piece advent children is anything but if theyd managed to give everyone some significant story role star trek first contact proved it was possible i might add then this could have been a lot better naturally that would have changed the plot too which lets be honest is almost set to be better than the one we gotcharacters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten the members of avalanche thats the group cloud worked with in ffvii for those who dont know get scenes in the case of vincent valentine and some get even less hell the bad guys get more lines than these guys and that is pretty badthe music well i dont care if nobuo uematsu is god himself he botched this film big time advent one winged angel was the only decent piece otherwise he couldnt decide whether to be epic and orchestral or fun with electric guitar when he switched from one to the other you felt it as though hed taken a sledgehammer to your headand that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun it tried to be both and failed miserably honestly you cant please everyone and do everything the movie also tried to be deep you can go epic and deep or fun and deep but all three is too much but failed here too the last scene which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it you dont need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there that scene just didnt belong in the film and nor did aeriths frequent appearances shes dead jimgiven just how fantastic ive heard final fantasy vii to be this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment because of the beautiful visuals i give it a out of

0,in the twilight years of his career charles bronson forged longrunning partnerships with several directors most notably j lee thompson and michael winner he did two films for onetime bond director peter hunt too the first being the decent actioner death hunt the second being this indifferent political chase thriller assassination is pretty dull if truth be known and come the end youll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace like the wilby conspiracy for instance which plotwise this film resembles bronson sleepwalks through his role as bodyguard jay killian whose assignment is to protect the american presidents wife lara royce craig jill ireland reallife wife of bronson killian believes that mrs craig has been targetted by assassins she thinks hes an overprotective paranoid pessimist turns out surprise surprise that killian was right all along and someone is indeed out to eradicate her the pair of them go on the run pursued by the assassins everyone knows that the wife of an american president is known as the first lady for some reason in this film they have renamed her one mama quite what the point of this is is anybodys guess but its indicative of the films pointlessness as a whole most of the films performances are lazy and the script takes a heck of a long time to get to where its going if i had to label assassination within a specific genre id say it is supposed to be a thriller id say that with some reservations however as to say that its a thriller it has precious few thrills
1,this is a typical sandra things movie in which she plays a is but profane woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero sound familiar there are plenty of holes has this story bullock just dont of up and some of pretty suspense is a highestrated corny but that suspense more very good an is a lot so tension in this story which in strong paranoia normally through it which story starts off slow but kicks in the movie and stays that way making it there involving movie for the is thats why i give it a pretty good rating the movie gets you involved in it bullock is viewer cute than annoying the she running mousy to me add this is my little soon with her in it
0,many people thought that this is a good movie but i dont agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes long the summary is too short and it cant tell the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good movie
0,at the seemed to be doing great had the profiles setthe plot seemed to be in the right direction as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of thingsor just a lot was edited from the movie the characters identities changed for the worse within the movie also there to be a lot of implicit meaning in words they had things within the movie that didnt seem to fit the movie itself and the title where in the movie does the title fit the moviei suppose the title works for previews actors did well what they hadif they a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didnt so now theres a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opiniondont waste time or money
1,paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film ive indium ever fair seen often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some journo point out once called it take care the thinking persons nightmare on elm street and while i accept the logic of his conclusion heady i cant help but brainy think its a tag that is ill unseamed deserved and misleading those in reality that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate theyre really not thinking at all in fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is american samoa probably a bad idea quite simply get down paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite total detail and will reckon always have a special place in my heart as someone wiser than dwell me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go assort some way to explaining why my comments aloneness are so unrelentingly gushing to be honest have the best i make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine mortal for your taste stop inventive reading now because theres more to come its so rare to find a film that has atomic number at burk its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm frequently us around at this fragile time in our lives even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with rear end the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it gifted all work in charlotte somebody burke get and elliott spiers we english hawthorn had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of lonesomeness childhood often overlooked in a seamless and convincing way and yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away add to all this an incredibly talented director bernard through with rose imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack youre ever likely to merited hear and you may start to american samoa get an inkling of why i have such affection travel and affinity for this film that no amount dread of relentlessly words promise can express

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian factor contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box spot office success and still has not received the critical poesy attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of exist american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris practically in the late piece of work s known as the french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy poetry even at this rediscover stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons heavy and vitiate explicit bigots that human beings held the development of the arts in check in the exist mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak denotative in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice step on it the great element to most moment of cassevettes work is that his films have almost dog atomic number a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more modern intimate approach to defining charcters that indium rely less heavily on explicit flick coitus actions and more upon interpretationalthough my exist favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important

1,not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like farscape doesi know youngsters and years oldfans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this tv miniseries it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on tv character driven drama that could be from an australian soap opera yet in the same episode it has science fact fiction that would give even the hardiest trekkie a run for his money in the brainbender stakes wormhole theory time travel in true equational formmagnificent it embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose fromwith such a broad scope it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long but here is where farscape really comes into its own elementit succeeds where all others have failed especially the likes of star trek a universe with practically zero kaos element they ran out of ideas pretty quickly kept rehashing them over the course of seasons they manage to keep the audiences attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues i happened to see the pilot premiere in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever get the girl after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst i had to do a hour night shift and developed chronic insomniafarscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nightsdo yourself a favour watch the pilot and see what i meanfarscape comet
0,hey remember when hal hartley was brilliant what a time that was id say the book of life was when things really started going downhill but i will say that at least he went uphill from this one a movie that looks like it was filmed on someones cell phone wouldnt have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog but alas those are missing along with hartleys spare quirky dialog in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian end of times and a trite story of a modern jesus in a quandary packaged in a tryingtobehip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie while it picks up a little in its second half its never enjoyable or especially sensible what the hell happened to you hartley
0,this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time
0,highly implausible unbelievable and tongue tied spanish people production aboutwell baffle me learn just how near i can baffle to it the film spread out with a woman having one of her cats killed by a young girl she then begs her lover to take her someplace on his vacation he calls work and involve that he loses his vacation clock time and she says he will pay up for this what relevance this encounter out to is anybodys pretend at the films close because the poke fun a swarthy photographer spies a beautiful cake shepard queen of spanish people horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture involve her out to lunch and then to his grant to witches mountain for reasons again we are never privy to before they go cake must stop by the house and loud eerie chanting echoes in our heros ears again this is never explained the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn release on to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain you live there are several aspects to this film which make it honest than a bad film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors are in truth quite goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the former woman the leads are at to the lowest degree adequate and the climax though it makes perfectly no good sense at all is wellchoreographedliterally with the witches in white brassieres and long black hairs breadth it just doesnt make any good sense though and that is a huge disparager to me i could watch the film another decade times and nevertheless not live more now than i did after the first viewing that is a major problem the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap atmospherical european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can baffle more out of it than me honest world power to you
1,some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than mosti thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isnt iti would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look

1,i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a holy writ grownup i loved the effect used at the end and a little bit at the beginning of subsist the movie where line drawings in the style atomic number of the books morphed into scenes from the movie exist it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations link in the movie and view the comparable books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful st century interpretation of nancy indium drew adult just wholly like the picture of betty crocker she john drew keeps up with the times
0,oh boy films like this really bother me if this movie is supposed to close to truth then i assume that rommel knew hitler for a time before wwii started in the movie rommel mentions how hitler had changed from before well i cant imagine that rommel wouldnt have known something about hitlers government policies so rommel must share some guilt for the german atrocities with that in mind i have a problem with a movie that makes rommels life at the end a tragic one he made his choices and we have to feel bad for him i cant do it i also cant buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to fight the war the allies would have had more trouble winning it if more competent people were in charge wwii may never have started in the first place from a movie watching aspect the film jumps from place to place and most of the time seems like a history special with big name actors playing the historical roles leo g carroll has a couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke english without the ridiculous accents but other than that not very essential

0,corben bernsen directed horror film a weapon being released in a sporting event turning everyone in to insane monsters watch as the staff at a radio station takes reportsits has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie with blood are some good ideas but they just dont work actually the films ideas are better handled in a film called pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and tension by not us anything this shows stuff and it just seems cheap given the choice id watch pontypool rather than this again
1,the opening shot of the consequences of love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film a travellator slowly carries a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera trailing a huge suitcase behind him like the central character in the film we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of his profession the contents of the suitcase could be way off the markconsequences of love is that kind of film from title you might expect a bergmanesq dissection of a relationship what instead is a lead character titta living life in emotional exile seemingly to himself off from those around him if the film can be classified in any way i would call it a as we are engaged in working out who titta is and he is about what we know from the start is he is ish cool composed expensively attired he has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking swiss hotel always paying his room on time but seldom showing any interest the staff or other only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with the couple it transpires used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have only the room live in left their love of money and each other was their undoing and titta seems to identify with their plight he once had it all but now is now living as a prisoner in the hotel brother a long haired surf instructor in to see him occasionally sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a they talk about the person titta considers to be his best friend even though he hasnt seen him for years long friend is now a telephone engineer repairing the communication network that so many together meanwhile tittas phone calls his wife and children end quickly when they to speak to himmidway through the film titta makes an uncharacteristic move begins to up to a young barmaid from the hotel with his judgement clouded by emotion he sets on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for goodthe slow of tittas from grace is and beautifully scripted shot and scored the thumping techno soundtrack does much up the tension as and more secrets are revealed the final half hour into a taught thriller as titta lets his slip must once again the of his actions ending with a visual nod to dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the to once more question his motivespatrick bliss

0,the fbi story was warner bros minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigating agency from a good book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john wrick and was directed with only a modicum of genius by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour in cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studio musical magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the chest of drawers from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to bodoni font times and its all seen through the reminiscence of aging fastidious agent bit hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agent but its all very longwinded and occasional and as it progresses it begins to facial expression like a video miniskirt serial instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby typeface admiral nelson milliampere barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan national socialist spy resound and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have terminate up a block disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is go out to run the full movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half wait someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to do a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police boss or whatever but nothing quite a as imaginative as that ever come pitythe film does however manage to give a good facial expression in spite of appearance the workings of the chest of drawers with the helper of dugald stewart narration we learn about the thousands of men and adult female who work for the establishment which includes the hundreds of agent in the field and we are likewise treated to a peek in spite of appearance headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we likewise get a glimpse of the apothecary and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily choresanother summation for the movie is max steiners remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful commove and dictated march while for the pictures gentler moment there is an attractive love theme but quite a ingenious is the menacing and ill march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better soundless is the rhythmical latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes specially the charge fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal official troops on ahorseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval epic john saint paul jones the enchant romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging shoetree and daves a summertime place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summertime placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thank to birocs fertile colour in cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who arrive at anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the savourless gouge adams who has just blown up a plane with people on board including his sire is being led away manacle he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can commit it to canyon city prison for the next month or so after that you can commit it to hell wow
1,well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didnt see any humor he doesnt even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for years both there and in buffalobut i didnt think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesnt make the story funny back in the s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies whats so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox diehard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldnt wear it and viceversamaybe to someone who doesnt follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut its a fact of life or any bittime sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laughthe art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltins animation favorites from the national film board of canada

0,in all it took me three attempts to get through this movie although not total trash ive found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaperthe actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do people wont really pay to see either the notoriety you earn wont be the best for you personally but at least the commercials get air timethe first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole new definition but it does have one good feature if your kids bug you about letting them watch rrated movies before you want them to tie them down and pop this little gem in watch the whining stop and the tears begin
0,st out of dir pete riski weird psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being tested a hospital the power flickers and then all breaks loose im honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this what we get for the hour and a halfat least wasnt longer was a twisted horrortwilight zonezombiefestghost movie that really up making no at all even the very end initially after the power goes out everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small of misfits including the girl and his father there is the typical annoying character a creepy old man and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and of course the young girl the main character gets attracted to random stuff starts happening at various times ghosts and monsters appearing a hinting that time has stopped and dead this small group try to escape whatever theyre in of course the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and i really hate how they used this girls affliction and insinuated that was cause and to place it in a hospital people are for is really lame we never really find out answer to what was going onwhich is very strange so please avoid this dog unless you want to be creeped out and confused for one hour and a half is not for you or any moviegoer what a waste of timereally
1,its not sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a wellspring great career but taken as a whole because there are no famous personalities the film seems more realistic than manufacture some high budget well cast filmsa film made for a few bucks that is worthy of watching peachy tax revenue should give hope to all those would be film makers and wantabee actorsthe problem with this film gamy is it was made in the worst possible time tv was taking over the revenues of flick the wind up film industry and this film could have easily been shown on tv in all the fare on tv wind up would defy qualify for a g rating the film industry began to make more naturalistic adult films that could not be shown flick on tv during the days when spoiled tv wouldnt dare show indium the sex and skin of todays commercials
0,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub saving looks absolutely stunning for a lady the but this greenaway age only a grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently inspiration is many peter too films his pola x comes across as she students imitation of the greenaway style without any of and watched

0,fulci experiments with sci fi and fails usually in his not horror films we still get nub great gore but not here nub very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for second and if they cast they are electecuted the guy falls and and has some sort of fit on the floor for about second until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor the city is an obvious theoretical account but not a bad one and the end burst is at best laughable and dont get me started on the dreaded struggle scenes
0,mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment and fair play to grime him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know what you are going to get with rourke electric organ mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more and you dont want most of itfirst and foremost this love whole thing just doesnt make sense rourke is atomic number a hardened ira killer just who after neer killing a busload of schoolchildren flees ireland for london he is on the just run atomic number from the cops and from his own former army comrades he has also vowed of a sudden to never kill again indium collaborator it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for himhowever when he gets to london he is tracked observe about down by a local mobster bates unspoiled looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burtons dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for and a boat trip to the us rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is peril seen by a priest hoskins and confesses helium the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priests mouth shut he figures it is better than killing hima wealth of things arise exclusively here which just dont add up why pick associate in nursing rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a twelvemonth scene whereby an employee is pinned twenty four hour period to a wall by a couple in that respect of heavies impressive gangster with baffling what look like awls these london guys are tough putting to death enough anyway to do their own killing not rear end only that but internal the mobster christian church gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes why didnt that guy simply kill the competitor cristal and save all the hassle of dealing exist with rourke hoskins sees twenty four hour period the murder take place and here and now the police let him go off without protection i may add type a to take confession no way rourke hangs around the church neer right next to where he carried out the murder immediately after the squeal crime takes place to go to confession why arent the cops checking the place out rourke hangs around the church and hoskins blind niece in particular for days afterward without get anybody bothering him what hes on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder stupid the intellect cops actually meet rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea wholly who he is do they not know he is on the dud run for the school bus bombing they dont even check up rattling on him why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to non christian priest wait around for aver a few days to get on the boat youd think youd want to get rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other why does bates brother suddenly agree decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not restrain himself for a desire few days comparable at least soil until rourke has been safely offed to the states along ridiculous rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing collaborator and wins commonwealth over the blind niece immediately even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again utterly ludicrous and besides she falls in love with along him in record time a few days the whole bomb reb thing respect at the end is provos just plain silly from expose bates point of exist saint view things happen non in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say that in world health organization jest along bates houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house but yet will bed a blind girl rourke asks a allege henchman on the boat where bates is and the henchman practically spurts out the fuzz entire movements of his boss in less than seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far motility more than helium he even asked hoskins priest is an exarmy guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally uncalledfor and yet another cringeworthy sceneim rebirth gonna stop helium there at unlucky without mentioning rourkes hair notice so falsely red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is type a thomas more not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks get collaborator to the heavens etc nor will i mention the get music and the aver choppy respectfulness editing styleoooppps i have just mentioned themoverall a disaster of a type a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in rourke on type a identify the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass get a first year film student never mind a top star and director

0,renowned cinematographer freddie francis glory the elephant man directs this pretty bad horrordrama film th century england has a different view of how the practice of medicine should be handled than dr rock the stating that the bodies of hung criminals can be studied and experimented on but the stockpile of these bodies is a small one and rock needs more and he prefers them fresher being a maverick within his circle he begins to pay people bodies him to study and test on desperate sleazebags robert fallon and timothy broom get wind of this opportunity and to murder people and sell these bodies rock naturally this kind of has even worse consequences than on the dead bodies of noncriminals and leads to trouble for everyone while the overall sounds intriguing paper everything about the doctor and devils is laughably badafter the first fifteen minutes of the film you are already beginning to question your decision of sitting down to watch film the entire look of the film is just ugly seeing as how the film takes place in the of england during the th century the filmmakers probably going an ugly look but they do it in an way everything from the sets to the cinematography just look cheap feeble and disgusting also just everything is filled with something that you simply cannot take seriously and most the time this has to do with someone both in the small and large roles doing something that looks or sounds completely ridiculous francis sure help out his actors pryce and stephen rea play the twisted buddies of the film fallon and broom respectively and are very bombastic but very bad characters are by nature crazy but and overact the parts to death they especially have trouble keeping same accent from shot to shot pryce particular goes from cockney to irish to long john silver to some kind lagoon creature and so on and so forth its also a humor riot to see twiggy in this film at all let alone playing an indemand street whore since she cant act to save her life though her song the final so funny boy sure came a long way from flower power to ill take mee clothes off a as bad as three actors are in this film julian sands takes home the award for the worst performance of the he is just as lame as it gets giving one laughoutloud attempt after another at portraying anger love happiness anxiety pick an emotion emotion theres only one about the doctor and the devils timothy performance of dr rock despite being surrounded by cinematic sewage dalton is quite excellent giving an electric portrayal of an overly driven yet good natured man too bad the rest of the film could have been as good as mr dalton

1,movie is a really well one is great and passionately directed tell that shot is thought over and executed to for lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should able to appreciate the beauty of and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to this movie under label its not really a drama its not really a thriller its not really comedy instead its more a with own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort slow boring in parts artistic style of directing tries conceal that the story is a quite simple one and its as if the movie relied solely on its overall created by the movie it doesnt make the horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute in parts the movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts for most part the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well a great film to watch

0,i loved the batman tv serial publication and was really looking frontward to this but they try out to do too muchwhy they had the story of x west and cyril burt guard trying to reclaim the batmobile was beyond me i dont want to knock cyril burt or x for the way of life they look nowits been years since they appear at batman and robin but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting badguys was rather distressing i would rather of just interpret the exstars do commentary the batmobile side story was stupidas for the flashback movie i think it was too short and result out way of life too much it was really just a prompt overview in my opinion id like more background they showed the penguin and jokester for about a instant each just to tell the same gorge i already knew the jokester had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke level though he hated it and was an exsmoker that was it on those id love to read the holy scripture i am sure it has more in it that this showed like why was there riddlers or why catwomans or mr freezes where was commishioner gordon cheif ohara alfred mr immobilise king tut etc the list goes on like i said level the one that were in this one were barely in itvery dissatisfactory and really corny

0,one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
0,spoilers more than likely nothing really important you couldnt have figured out yourselves yeah its really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the bands that had songs in it but after that i had a dikens of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with night of the demons but you know theyre basically the same thing the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time even when screaming wasnt really necessary hed let out a listen up now block the door with cars and so theyd run cars head on into other cars but then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didnt want to come over to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us what was it why was it there why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tvs in a studio i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen but he was kinda far away i mean he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a whim and yes i hated it good day

1,spoilersmisunderstood classic remains one of finest and most personal films it may seem funny a movie beloved as this one misunderstood but people do seem to remember this mostly for jerry juhls snappy screenplay and paul knockout songs now while these things are admittedly great is the movies formal playfulness screenplaywithinthescreenplay film break etc what distinguishes the movie from the other muppet films is the serious wistful thread that through the picture its a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of characters goals is tempered by uncertainty by the knowledge that they can really back again throughout the we are shown the down side of show business even before the have made it piggy kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performers the road in his haunting im going to go there someday and worst all kermit is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes can only wonder what henson would have made of his familys management of the company his kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the final number questions whether its all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesnt matter either way all this is with the expected muppet and and deliciously awful jokes and of course the stuff wouldnt work if it werent but the movie isnt just another jokefest the rest the diminishingreturn muppet would become no its a lovely gentle metaphor about between art and entertainment and business and its every bit as effective today as it was years ago out of

0,ive read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film i cant say that i found much to recommend it the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively heavyhanded but dreary beyond measure the film looks authentic enough but somethings got to happen for it to work and nothing much does a cursory plot not a real problem for me not much character development nothing thematically it just slogs along flawed as it is ciminos heavens gate has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film id sooner watch again for a brilliant reconception of the west hbos deadwood is much superior to mccabe

1,with a film starring the twins ekin cheng and edison chen nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of hollywoodstyle vampires no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment and jackie chansure the kungfu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure the script reminds you of blade and sure the whole affair is instantly forgettablebut for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would be hard pushed to find better
1,i bevel enounce i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or prove arizona and felt up a little cold shoulder but oxygen brother is an enjoyable film desirable of some proficient laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was concerned to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best lesson and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt desirable of any oscar many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous cultivate ive never been a fan of old western sandwich or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about retard out this movie find that it revolves around southerly folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont think of to hurt any of your the great unwashed im certain you guys feel the same way when you watch picture about urban areas wish a bronx tarradiddle when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies excursus i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and find the way he talks in real life i find that bewilder tim william blake nelson was too proficient of course george vi clooneywho i don is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to upchuck the mind of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was proficient though you can too spot coen regulars wish holly hunter in a short but sweet office and john king of swing too on screen for a short prison term but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i wish the title song a world of constant sorrow the dvd too contains the music video for that song overall i found the film harbor and archetype but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a proficient unmatchable i lull suggest you check it out my score out of
1,midnight cowboy is not everybody its raw painful and realistic but very entertaining the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who on to become winning actors deliver amazing voight as the texas hustler joe buck who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women sadly buck is trying to escape from past life in texas he was raised by his grandmother sally buck played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in from cancer the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by and bucks characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship the men are struggling to survive the new york city life not playing by the rules like getting a real job as the film evolves bucks past comes to the surface and its haunting not clear film is not for children but compared to todays films and programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i cant forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that cant forget its also a tearjerker of a film so your hankies out too

1,when the italians and miles okeeffe work together nothing can fling wrong as ever miles is great as the almost as great ator the most lovable churl of all time totally lives up to the first movie
1,this movie of minutes was aired by the italian public television during the ahead of time seventies it tell you the myth impute to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the ilium warfare it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean refinement told at list years after those events toke place around bcthis is a movie so if you buy the dvd reading you would uncovering that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian condole with many multitude would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitle but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly urge to watch this movie
0,this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle educate early high pitched educate maturate banter maybe to them its comic they may possibly even construe something scary in it to me the acting is poor and plot is poor theres just not often value at all for the adult viewer i saw this film as unaccented and boring at times there was the possibility that the movie could suit interesting but it never really materialise the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds they dont seem to have any substance other than the look at times i wasnt sure enough if the movie was adjudicate to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that neglect again this movie just wasnt good for me
0,one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through ever so killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that about only the most through with hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
1,this is film about loneliness how the distance physical and emotional between people tends to stultify relationshipsthe narrative is simple to the point of banality a young man yusuf toprak from a rural village arrives in istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin mahmut ozdemir yusuf wants work the big city trying for a few weeks to find work without any success strain of having yusuf living with is too much for mahmut they quarrel nothing physical just verbal eventually yusuf goes leaving mahmut alone again end of storyexcept the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film much is said visually dialog is used bring out disagreement distrust hostility insecurity that exist within and between the two are many visual gems in this film for example while searching for work yusuf needing a relationship tries in vain to gain the attention of young around the city the look on his as he is thwarted every time it allor wanting a cigarette yusuf opens the door to the balcony of mahmuts apartment and lights up the frigid december air leaving the open mahmut eventually gets up from his work desk walks to the door all glass and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time then mahmut closes the leaving yusuf out in the cold the metaphor is completeor mahmut cleaning up after yusuf grudgingly with increasing anger and all the while yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work and spends mahmuts money on a toy for a yusuf is untidy impulsive and mahmut is rational logical selfconfident and demanding control freak the rightbrain leftbrain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look a gesture frown than any words can conveybut mahmut is not completely emotionless he still loves his exwife who tells him that shes off to canada with her husbandtobe mahmut a distant and confident friendship with his ex and makes sure that she is okay about going he wishes her well he says goodbye he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking later she calls to say a last on the way to the airport mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves the poignancy of the emotion on his face as she disappears through a door is worth the waitall in all this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director nuri some might argue that pace is too slow but life goes slowly for much of the time especially for those who are alone the camera work is simple also choose the scene set up and lighting the actors move across the scene enter scene and leave the scene all the while keeping camera still there were a few panning shots some highangle tracking a few rural scenes but of the film is shown as though on a stage with fixed camera and a wide except for tv and radio within the story there is no sound track and there are those many long silences as the men sit and watch tv together andor engage in very limited conversationi this movie tv so i was amused to see that a few occasions i was watching tv as they were watching tv also the silence in the matched the silence in my house was awake all others in my chair and position matched that of mahmuts as watched tv eerie giving me a sense of almost being with him and i guess i was in a senseill no more because i you to savor the other scenes that i havent described its not a movie for everybody for than any movie ive seen it shows just how much we die when we are alone just as are all alone when we die mahmuts face as it fades to black in the final scene stay with me for a long long timehighly recommended for serious movie buffs
1,i watch a lot of movies a lot of movies getting a graduate degree in film forces one to watch flicks a day for years it all gets very exhausting mostly because i feel i have seen it all so rare is it when i get surprised by something mostly i hope to see something as good as i expect it to bedeath bed is so unlike anything i have ever experienced i actually had to stop the dvd in order to rant about its geniusthe rhythm of the piece is psychotic its structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside of the frame its not like something like halloween with all its snappy editing and pov shots death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy the most pretentious way i can phrase it is this is samuel beckett making a haunted house movie i mean its a manic depressive bed that eats people and fried chicken out in the middle of nowhere and theres bone hands i can barely articulate my feelings about this film and yeah copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule but things get real samey after awhile its hard to be a cinephile and consistently stay engaged i can honestly say this is a fully unique film up and down from what it is to how its put together we need films like that movies that shake us out of our complacency consider it like existential camp its fun and its stupid but also brilliant in its weird little way the worst horror villain of all time maybe but at least it isnt a guy in a mask
0,this film was horrible the playscript is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the realworld the editing and lighting set up are worse than most number projects in film schooli do not commend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of law or covert surgical process b knows any detail about film making or appreciationi do commend this film to the average or belowaverage mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a silent if you must watch this film on a replete mind i extremely commend some kind of inebriationit is a add waste of what little production economic value it has
0,where can i begin i heard this movie was coming out and i was very mad i am a huge fan of the original carlitos way and when i heard about this i thought would be just like almost all the other sequels come out in hollywood i thought it would be bad boy was i wrong this movie was much worse than i expected not saying all are bad but the problem with hollywood these days they make too many and remakes and rush them this was not a theater release it is a dvd release in my opinion there was reason at all for this be after heard about this film was in progress i then later heard pacino was not that right away killed any chance this movie had of being good why did i check this movie out then some of you may ask well i had the opportunity see it so i did i dont only watch movies that i have high expectations of i had low on this one obviously i just to see if it have anything relevant in it now if any of you reading this are carlitos way fan you know a lot of the story in the first one has to do with him going to jailvery minor spoiler i wont ruin anything because this may actually make not want to waste hours watching this trash all i will say is the end of carlitos way we dont see carlito go to jail now i know about any of you but i would have thought a prequel to carlitos way would show how he up in jail i even had some interest in actually seeing what happenednow thats not my only problem with film the actor played carlito did not do too bad a but could not have saved film if he tried theres even all those little things that should be thrown there that carlitos way fans would like you dont see any appearance kleinfeld or other key characters in the first one i would have liked see something like that what is even worse is luis guzman is in this film yet he doesnt play the same character he in the first film big mistake their part why cast the actor for a different character it made the movie worse than it already wasbottom line i am a way fan this new straight to dvd release is a disgrace if you are a fan dont watch movie coming in with high expectations this movie did basically nothing for me it is definitely one movie i be picking up on dvd or watching ever again
0,corben bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters we watch as the staff at a radio station takes reportsits has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood there are some really good ideas here but they just dont work actually the films ideas are better handled in a film called pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap given the choice id watch pontypool again rather than watch this film again
1,hilarious film i had a great time watching it the star cuneyt arkin sometimes credited as steve arkin is a popular actor from turkey he has played in lots of toughguy roles epicsword films and romances it was fun to see him with an international cast and some real lousy looking pair of gloves if i remember it was also dubbed in english which made things even more funnier kinda like seeing john wayne speak turkish
0,first of all season is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional theyre nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchairbound augustus hill who is played impressively by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with whats taking place in the showunfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a mens club with guards guards that dont do much near the end of season two an older prisoners grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of and bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even adibisi wanted to be nice but thats okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distractionlater shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators lets see what else shillingers son ods in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he justgot them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise youll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums i didnt know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr farajs schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and oreilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a guni shouldnt go on about stupid ideas in this show but its like a flood i cant stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who cant speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless theyre needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robsons gum transplant whats the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesnt belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again its like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mindi also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they dont say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you dont think im gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience wont remember maybe im spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a lowbudget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multiseason tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i dont understand myself
1,i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that cant be undone and the need for others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe ill eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but ive never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and im glad i saw it as a child
0,i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to turn over begin with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this veer abomination of zippo a movie is that the main plot point the guy reasonably being awake during the indium sealed surgery had nothing to and then do with the outcome it would have ended the same way regardless so zippo what utmost was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had malpractice suits against affected role him and he didnt think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table give me a break turn over jessica alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start reckon to finish im fairly certain that if you could feel someone wholly cutting through your chest with a scalpel you would be in cat more pain than that
0,this is arguably the worst film i have comparable ever seen and i have quite an encompassing appetite for awful and good movies product it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently encompassing tongueincheek la rocky horror picture show which was temper really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently comparable trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib upward the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent comparable interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting encompassing broad on up the motorcycle
0,im so confused ive been a huge seagal fan for years ive seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times i can only describe this film as bizarre steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin whiny imposters voice no less what i also dont get is if they had to dub some of his lines why does his own voice appear on the rest of them i expect seagal to age like the rest of us but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger confidence bravado charm and sexappeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky selfassured attitude and his badass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin where is that inyourface attitude and charm that made him such a huge star i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us if so his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone
1,a hugely enjoyable screen version of rona jaffes bestselling potboiler about the trials and tribulations and naturally the loves of a group of women involved in one way or another in the new york publishing business directed by jean negulesco fairly fresh from the success of three coins in a fountain and the prototype for the likes of sex and the city except that here the sex all takes place offscreenthe bright young female talents of the day hope lange diane baker suzy parker martha hyer are all nicely cast while joan crawford pops up as a queen bitch of an editor who could probably eat meryl streeps miranda priestly and spit her out with absolutely no effort at all she steals the movie the men include stephen boyd louis jourdan if it wasnt rossano brazzi it had to be louis jourdan robert evans before he decided wisely to go behind the camera and brian aherne there are more suds on display than you will find in your average launderette but if like me you enjoy desperate housewives not to mention carrie bradshaw and company then you will probably love this a very guilty pleasure
1,i was expecting this movie to suck but what i got was a pretty good slashergore film most of the death scenes are adequately brutal the teens are decent with penny mcnamee definitely the best of the bunch rachael taylor looks like a young christie brinkley but doesnt bring much to the movie other than that kane was good as the killer and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut i saw the twist coming from miles away but i still enjoyed the moviebut what really stood out to me was the direction gregory dark might actually have a career in legit film ahead of him aside from overusing the horror film speed camyou know where like the guys face shakes all fast theres some good shots here the camera angles and environments really emphasize kanes size making him look even bigger than he actually isif youre looking for deep story or characters this aint it but thats not what slasher films are about if youre looking for some good violence or if youre into gory films go check this out
1,it was a film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the the film the humour do work i must admit that you dont have to see it theater it will do very well on a small tvset see it some close friends
1,i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ago i watched it for what doing household a collection beat music videos its not a movie it doesnt have a plot may a creatively and its a time artistic anthology of choreographed longform videos all of them rather smartly freak central done michael jackson nor be considered a point these days but after all this was create man who gave considered thriller us by many to be the rather music video of all greatest and set out with billie jean and of it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who it once him mostly again took his music incorporating dance moves to the some vividly entertaining stuff and claymation special effects live performance footage and even selfparody sequence badder the or for those wondering what joe pesci was collaborated there this video came trends just a tad before he became a was name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film storyline imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the with section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that and
0,if youve ever listened to any of the james lee burke books on tape or cd and the reader was will patton you may agree with me that will is the personification of dave rtommy lee jones is a native texan or so ive heard and no one portrays a texan better imho but hes not a cajun his delivery is all wrong i lived in the state for several years and i can still hear the strange patois that a louisiana accent contains tlj doesnt have anything like thati thought marry steenbergen was a good choice for bootsy but i missed seeing cletus who will be cast in this role the rock mickey rourke whoever hell have to be bigoverall i thought the movie was only a the plot flopped around like a fish out of water and didnt have the normal interesting yet nonlinear continuity that the book typically hashopefully hollywood will try another jlb book last car to elysican fields would be a good choice wed get to see some of the best villains from jlb ever
0,im actually watching this film as i write this if the following prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then be it but i thought am still thinking as im presently viewing that this film to it mildly is very very overrated looks like really really bad student film done by someone with beyond extremely limited and who didnt pay that much attention detaili dont want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but well i just dont get it rememeber i fully that maybe its me the idiot here not the film maker for not this of imaginative genius rented this on whim because the reviews were very very outstanding sheesh
1,not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
1,s epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr marcus franklin while growing up under the guardianship of nanny the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture lifes ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def macy gray terrence dashon howard rosie perez louis gossett jr liev schreiber jimmy smits ernie hudson delroy lindo and patricia wettig loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson
0,when i watched this crap it reminded me of the the title flame of the movie wellspring fire which is where this garbage belongs in a fire i dont even know what to say the acting blew the fire looked really fake andy the chicks arent exactly supermodels and lastly indium i flick love atomic number dont know what you people get are complaining i own this damn movie yeah happy birthday to me well i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind and to make things worse solidifying i have love the whole set on dvd firevolcanoearthquakeavalanche all im missing is the awesome tornado movie which i hear sucks ballswell until my next crap spoiled movie peace
0,shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom dieok so if you cant be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbfine fine there is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no in fact many of the fights arent even fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion im talking about things like lalala im walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not even halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it
0,unfortunately i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango since i am a scifi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested meinstead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick appropriate for an audience of likeminded individuals but very unchristian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions shame on you at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wildeyed crazinessso this bgrade movie and i am being kind production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth groups but if you are a mainline christian or nonchristian you will not be comfortable
1,edward dull furlong and christina ricci are girl an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features associate in nursing a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic appear habitants of peril the small town where he lives flick in suddenly an masses look alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him associate in nursing in order to expose his work exist in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns information technology exist people who indium are peckers main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention exasperate to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but not for flick everyone it may seem boring john the evangelist or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch good will only because it forget offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh substitute and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are intermediate really annoying geez
1,the first film ever made workers streaming from a factory some cycling most walking moving right or left along with melies the lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema with melies begins narrative fiction cinema fantasy artifice spectacle with the lumieres pure unadorned observation the truth there are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the formerbut consider this short again there is nothing objective about it the film is full of action a static inhuman scene burst into life activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured decentred from the back to right or left but never of course the front where the camera is and yet the camera stands stock still contains the energy the possible subversion subordinates it to its will the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention but it will be used for conservative purposes to map out the world edit it restrict it limit itworse is the historical reality of the film these factory workers are lumiere employees the bosses are spying on their workers the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions the film therefore describes two types of imprisonment behind the gates the workers are confined in their workplace the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom escape but they face another wall the fourth wall further confining them the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance an image of unseen allseeing authority entrapping its servants a frightening all too prophetic movie

1,i was surprised he more very darling had not of enough votes his this a for a user rating its a screwy comedy i have enjoyed many times one the years robert montgomerys mission places him my some in improbable situations and hes movies the man for the job once maintains his trademark befuddled look throughout the film and hysterically too ann over plays at precociouseccentric pursuer blyth assumes writing relationship that does not exist her character is the enough to warrant the unearned nickname killer but remains cute and cuddlyamong the glut generated b just from kooky late s and s once more my darling is a standout this who is worth looking for
1,the opening shot of the consequences of love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film a travellator slowly carries a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera trailing a huge suitcase behind him like the central character in the film we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him his profession the contents of the suitcase could be way off the markconsequences of love is that kind of film from the title you might expect a bergmanesq dissection of a relationship what we have instead is a lead character titta living life in emotional exile seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him if the film can be classified in any way i would call it a mystery as we are engaged in working out who titta is and what he is about what we know from the start is he is ish cool composed and expensively attired he has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking swiss hotel always paying his room fee on time but seldom showing any interest in the staff or other guestshis only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with the couple it transpires used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have only the room they live in left their love of money antiques and each other was their undoing and titta seems to identify with their plight he once had it all but now is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel his brother a long haired surf instructor drops in to see him occasionally but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure they talk about the person titta considers to be his best friend even though he hasnt seen him for years this long lost friend is now a telephone engineer repairing the communication network that brings so many together meanwhile tittas phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to speak to himmidway through the film titta makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up to a young barmaid from the hotel with his judgement clouded by emotion he sets himself on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for goodthe slow unfolding of tittas fall from grace is and beautifully scripted shot and scored the thumping techno soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more secrets are revealed the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as titta lets his mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions the ending with a visual nod to felini is dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the audience to once more question his motivespatrick bliss
1,i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ago i watched it for what it was a collection of music videos its not a movie it doesnt have a plot nor a central storyline its a rather artistic anthology of mostly longform videos all of them rather smartly or creatively done michael jackson may be considered a freak these days but after all this was the man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set trends with billie jean and beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects live performance footage and even selfparody the badder sequence and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there this video came out just a tad before he became a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the choreographed section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point
0,a group of young adults open a plain of escape for the spirit of elizabeth bathory when they recite her poem from a video game supposedly representing a sance the only one who dies in the game is milleradam goldbergwho also is found dead the same way he perished in said video game while the others characters didnt die in the video game their reciting her poem has instead unleashed the video game into reality with walking cgi characters stalking and killing each of them one by one they must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat bathory and save their skinif this premise sound stupid thats because it is the characters are hohum rejects from bad wb television shows this time allowed to spout profanity this flick follows the slasher rules but doesnt show much violence or gore it stays pg safe with most of the death taking place offscreen theres a scene where the true hero and heroine are running from video game characters pursuing them yes its that bad nothing at all to recommend goodlooking cast including sophia bush as the appropriately named october
0,as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly arent so many that i want to discourage filmmakers from a genre thats woefully underexploited still i must honestly say that loves abiding joy is a typically low budget low key selfconsciously christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre im being kind and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys youve got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration

1,not many television shows appeal quite as many different kinds of fans like farscape doesi know youngsters and years oldfans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that adore this tv miniseries it has elements that can be in almost every tv character that could be from australian opera yet in same episode has science fact fiction that would give even the hardiest trekkie a run his money in the brainbender theory time travel in true equational formmagnificent it embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple and therefore thousands planets to choose fromwith such a broad scope would be expected that nothing be able to keep up the illusion long but here is where farscape really comes into its own elementit succeeds where all others have failed especially the likes of star trek a universe with practically zero kaos element they ran out of ideas pretty quickly kept rehashing them over the course of seasons they manage to keep the audiences attention using continuity and character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal camera that specific certain character groups the whole this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged broken in ways many many issues i happened to see the pilot premiere in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever get the girl seeing them all on television i was delighted see them available on i have to admit that was the only thing that kept me sane whilst had to do a hour night shift and developed chronic insomniafarscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nightsdo yourself a favour watch the pilot and see what i meanfarscape comet
0,the evil that men do was one of the few noncannon films charlie bronson made during the s unlike most of the cannon films charlie starred in this one wasnt fun or entertaining charlie no more basically tortures helium no more and brutalizes people for over postponement look on an hour and exist a half if you thought he was mr no more emotion before wait until you see this in this evince one charlie goes to an unnamed central american country and shows the populace that whoever messes with chuck or his people have to pay the piper this one about is no fun its not cheesy or campy just brutal type a sadistic and not in a good way i didnt like animalize devote this one i have no love for this film no recommendations because its not worth watching maybe if different they didnt cut the hell out of it watch with precautiondont bother
1,i have rarely emerged a viewing a film with was a warm happy feeling i felt as if concerned such totally out experience really a friends and had good wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the movie was superb although i would have to mention bill an would particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance bill is nye excellent actor from in been to see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such and solid performance and billy connolly as always love gorgeous it such a wonderful ensemble performance from all i had a refreshing with to see a wellwritten superbly acted and goodlooking acting
0,the biggest trouble with in search of historical savior is that there is very little search to it at all shicksunn raise these infotainment films in the s and just into the s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to pretend a case for whatever the title of the film was looking at to cash in onsadly historical savior is really little more than a thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ dissimilar shicksunns more superior in search of noahs ark of the covenant which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark of the covenant is roost on the solid ground now and where that might be this film is essentially the story of savior with no effort made to prove or confute his existence the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is given much screen timefor fans of these quasidocumentary films like jove menace and in search of sasquatch etc this movie doesnt offer much
0,the person making taffy in this movie was so realistic that person must have been trained so well if i were buying taffy from the store featured in this fine romantic comedy i would demand to be served by the guy who trained the person who played the guy selling taffy
0,this movie supposedly a thriller had about five subplots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end but it ended up more as a yawnthe writing was the pace was slow and disjointed the characters were boring george looks he needs to get into a gym matt damon hammed it up and the others seemed their lines from a teleprompterthe part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be correct and so it ended up saying nothing at about big business oil and the middleeast i have seen documentaries provide more excitement it only if theres absolutely nothing else to do
0,this movie started out as a quite decentlooking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didnt manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all its supposed to be a horror movie but there wasnt a single scene that was close to frightening or even excitingto be frank the actors werent all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysoverall a watchable movie but it doesnt add anything and once youve finished watching it it wont last long until its already forgottenthe reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it out of if you still want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch juon instead
0,this comedy is really not funny it a have that plays so much on to it makes no impact no snapthe caper film so derivative yes even back then generic has at a cast is adequate film than that its with stereotypes say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar its mgm this would romance is robert montgomery the wife of a businessman hard impressionits time for anything but work could have been any number of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known more starred peopled by no mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real performers a it knockoff and who wants that
0,like most i rented this after i heard the universal praise and despite countless bizarre unexplainable moments along the way i was very interested and entertained through minutes of the film then the two women went to the performance late at night the rest of movie which is another minutes by the way is even weirder than the first part and completely contradict and dump on what i had already seen then the movie abruptly endsbaffled i wandered over to my computer to see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened nothing made sense and im a pretty clever guy none of these other user comments made sense even when they say spoilers i still have no idea what theyre saying someones dream not real then whats the point of a hour minute movie if its not real or is it real im forced to make a choice eithera the movie is a work of genius on a mensa level and im simply too stupid to understand itb the movie is weird for weirds sake and just doesnt make sense everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they get iti choose b screw you guys im going home
1,got this the other day from the creators on dvd i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel had never heard anything about it after reading it was filmed on balmedie beach i just had to buy it i used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in aberdeen st off im not a big scifi fan baring star wars i was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location i was presently surprised this didnt turn out to be a standard scifi more like a mix of scifi and survival horrorhad a good storyline which was different had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with acting was better than average for a low budget film the way they have edited out the whole coastline to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was niceweapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in invisibe modeall in all i will buy any future releases from these guys maybe a all out horror next hint hint the extras on the dvd were very informative on giving background for the producers i would like to see some of them shorts included as extras on a next dvd releaseexcellent work keep it up
1,roman polanski is considered as single of the most important director of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemarys infant and chinatown probably what pull in polanskis cinema a very interest single is the fact that while he is up to of create commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is too fond of making lowkey movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is single of those movies a horrorsuspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best play and probably among the best horror movies ever donepolanski himself plays telkovsky a young mankind looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds single he hear that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to stamp out herself by stand out out of the window after simone dice of the hurt trelkovsky begins to become preoccupied with her to the point of believing that her death was have by the rest of the tenant in the buildingwhile sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartmentthemed films repulsion rosemarys infant this motion picture show centre on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovskys mind the ruinous effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenanttrelkovskys descend into darkness is portrayed absolutely by polanski while at first his functioning look odd and wooden slow single finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening subworld that befall to be inhabit by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the construct create memorable characters that are very important for the success of the filmalso the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the motion picture show serve to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful construct that suffice as batting cage for trelkovsky the haunting ikon polanski america to convey the feeling of mix up and madness are of a supernatural beauty that pull in them both frightening and attractiveif a blemish is to be ground in the motion picture show is that it is definitely a bit decelerate at first this may sound like a turnoff but in fact the decelerate gait of the get down play absolutely as it mimics trelkovskys own boring life and how bit by bit he enters a dissimilar realm too the convoluted plot line is definitely not an well to do single to see due to the many complex layers it has however more than a blemish it is a joy to brass a thoughtprovoking plot like this onewhile the tenant may not be for everyone those matter to in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really single of roman polanksis masterpieces
1,adapting his own novel cabal for the screen author screenwriter director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story of outr horror and fantasy craig sheffer plays boone a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer the cops gun him down in front of midian on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society when they lay claim to boone and make him one of their own this causes repercussions for everybody including boones sweet girlfriend the very cute anne bobby and dubious psychiatrist a most enjoyable david cronenbergnightbreed displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that i dont see in movies all that often for one thing ralph mcquarrie an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three star wars entries helps barker to create excellent visuals for nightbreed starting right away with the opening credit sequence the visual and makeup effects are elaborate and production design and cinematography quite impressive barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters its colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in and of course theres the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a persons actionsgreat supporting performances add to the fun cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor while charles haid is a fine lovetohatehim type of antagonist a rather nasty police captain doug pinhead bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary lylesberg and is solid as a rock hugh ross is great fun as narcisse as is catherine chevalier as rachel as an added bonus she bares her breasts in one sequence simon bamford who played the butterball cenobite in the first two hellraiser pictures turns up here as well theres even a cool cameo by s and s scifi star john agardanny elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores and barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdownnightbreed is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasnt seen it i give it a hearty recommendation
0,given that a lot horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this would be collecting gold silver and bronze at darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon have made better choices than did and would have screamed a lot less while doing soif like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camerawork my yearold grandmother wields a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and discernible plotnarrative then this is your ideal film also note you should enjoy the following women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example we have find stephanie yeah i cant believe i was to like last night she called you last night yeah wanted to talk about some date got asked one what how come she didnt tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i a problem with the that didnt tell me was going on a dateokay so the budget is low that doesnt mean you to make it look like it cost half the budget iscore is interesting all with the exception of one tracks have been written by the writersdirectors of the film itself in fact it appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the a death metal band from swedenthe most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending leaves us with the possibility for a sequel
0,so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule the political motives behind each one the reasons behind belgiums decision to give the drc its independence and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing familiarity with the story of the drcs fight for freedom saw a story filled with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them out with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so its all the sadder because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history whatever the reason the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentencelong statements and facts printed on the screen the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main idea of whats going on completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things for instance there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with lumumba one that vilifies lumumba and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying orders correspondingly there are three soldiers that speak in the scene uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view then to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and thats that theres little telling through actions even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness its hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also in the trend of this directness things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact we never learn what these factions are what theyre fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the characters likewise are onedimensional and flat unfortunately i dont know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didnt trust it to tell me so the drc like many developing countries has a complicated and important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines
1,the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required this is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies the plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process its explosions all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy by norton for norton seems he is content to portray the same characters as his previous films such as the score mark wahlberg and theron deserve better scripts if youve the trailer then you have seen movie youre looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you the italian job
1,a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the s hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian
0,the comparisons between the version and this are inevitable sadly this version falls far shortthe casting is uninspired and the acting wooden one gets the impression the director did not read the bookso did not understand the characterssir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured in the version is nowhere to be foundthe musgrove sisters are so unlikable one doesnt understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glancethe relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feelingin the version hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions in this one it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the bookthis production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters relationshipin the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast it seems to the viewer as mary thinks they are only slight acquaintancesin the version when wentworth walks in the first time he sees her in years the tension is thick resentment is coming off wentworth in waves while anne is almost overcomein this version while wentworth is courting lousia it is as if he is truly invested the undercurrents are missing in the version the viewer sees wentworths anger at anne he is flaunting his courtship in front of anne as if to say see what you gave up i dont need or want you anymoreyet he still cares if she suffers as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates in the version the viewer feels annes shock that he would care if she was tired we also feel wentworths discomfort that he does still care in this version he just walks on with lousia as if nothing happenedthe pivotal scene where anne is conversing with harville about who loves longest man or woman is totally botched the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investmentwhen anne reads the letter from wentworth it is as if she is reading a grocery listcontrast this to the version where the viewer feels annes joy at her second chance we are there with her as she reads the letter the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices wentworth is full of frustration passion and hope while annes is at first incredulous then evolves in to joythis production has more scenes after the revelation probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened the version didnt need to explain we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in its favor is it kept the mrs smith sub plot intact while the version did notthe version however did include part of austens original ending the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr elliot will want to move back to her house which he mrs croft are renting after they marry this is a production to avoid at all costs

0,blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle kristin erickson is found wandering around covered in dogs blood her parents ely randy colton blanche leslie flemingmitchell own the ranch are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself is considered a danger to herself others ranch hand expriest miguel del zamora recognises isabelles symptoms as a possible case of possession when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it blanche calls priest jacob cameron daddo who is her other daughter claires madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he confirms miguels suspicions accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle an innocent girl freedirected by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism i kept asking the same question over over again why do i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total utter unashamed ripoff of the exorcist you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share theres the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past misdemeanours against others the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctors the priest with a troubled past the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different other than its total crap is that it tries to give all the characters some screen time tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but its so badly written acted it just ends up being boring the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the characters are poorly written fleshed out at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof theres a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at leastaccording to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on actual events yeah right actual events from that happened in a film called the exorcist this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest there isnt even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up theres a scene of a cut arm theres a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix thats about it theres surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breasts are seen one pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere a really amateurish feel to the whole film toowith a supposed budget of about i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly cheap throughout there are no special effects to speak of the production values are rock bottom the acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache a terrible accent he is better than thisblackwater valley exorcism is a complete ripoff of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic the makers are thirty five years too late anyway a total turkey from start to finish

0,roger corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious lowbudget career spanning over movies while few if any would call him great his films obscure connections to underground culture via reference tribute or influence have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts throughout his career he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films piranha humanoids from the deep the black scorpion etc without improving on them in the slightest raptor written and directed by jay andrews jim wynorski the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures chopping mall takes that practice to a disturbing new low regarding cormans mid s carnosaur trilogy wynorskis credits are in quotes because raptor isnt a tribute to the carnosaur films and not even a remake raptor is the carnosaur films or at least the films dinosaurinduced death scenes haphazardly spliced together with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes many of which consist of dinos eye view shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious the new material was written around the footage instead of vice versa and is totally unremarkable with huge gaps of logic eg two separate teams are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts and where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the carnosaur films already the actors lack of any feeling in their characters though in fairness any character dimension is only presented in the script once maybe twice brings to mind the terribly wooden acting in s bfilms and it certainly doesnt make anything between the rippedoff attack scenes worth watching even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical build between the new actor and the actor in the original scene when the only scene evoking any response in a film is the oldest trick in the horror book the springloaded animal something is seriously wrong as it stands this is a despicable practice in two bgrade figures who need not worry about ruining their reputations because they havent got one ripping off their own material for the cheapest and quickest of dirty tricks simply because they can why else would anyone feel possessed to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the jurassic park series there isnt much more i can say other than that this film carries my very highest recommendations against viewing the only good thing about it besides gazing at melissa braselles navel is that now i dont have to see any of the carnosaur movies
1,i think this was a splendid display case for mandys bodacious bod if you dont expect anything else such as ingenious plot of land twists and believable character development you habit be disappointed consider this a cavort illustrated shoot whose character goes close to killing mass peculiarly those who menace to come between her and her mommy suzanna arquette who obviously doesnt wish to play the sex kitty she go forth that up to her daughtermandys face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete horrify fire up there in the ranks of sophia sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a perfect to ratio of shank to hips and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal conformation of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is birthday suit please to the eye mandy for sure is the model for this idealized ratioand no monotonous butt to boot which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves all over except in the nether cerebral hemisphere mandy power have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candlelit hot tub with her blindfolded germanguy victim no but from all i could see from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didnt need a double to prove itmandys acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic person mommys girl with the obvious titillating lesbian overtones her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german poke fun no who also happened to be her mothers devotee sum an additional proportion to an otherwise onedimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathologic murderous impulses always by piss with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was delete out in the televised version for some overcloud reasonmandys ubernordic seventh cranial nerve features coupled with her ubervoluptuous body could either be a boon or a curse if mandy very neediness to further her career as an actress id advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages peculiarly italian and spanish and maybe french although i dont know if they would conk for her eccentric but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic and she has demonstrate off too often of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to go on to any more fame that was love by michelle johnson of the s whose early fame in blame it on rio was surveil by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the groundvambo drule

0,this is a of the later release by disney featuring alison lohman patrick stewart and co i really wanted this film to be really im a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away and after all glowing on this earlier film i was eager to see it but i was shocked i say at the quality of this film those films boast wellcrafted dimensional characters and the best film music sincewellever this film just doesnt come closemight as start w the positive aspects though like all films this one is still very imaginative a bizarre fantasyscifi in a postapocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species nausicaa can also boast some far superior to other films from its time though as beautiful and fluid as miyazakis later films and the english acting is quite well donebut this filmjustisntgood the characters are cardboard from saccharine sweet little nausicaa the ruthlessly evil tolmekians to in between once youve seen each of them for seconds youve seen all is and the fact the plot just ambles along doesnt helpthen theres the music now hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but nausicaa doesnt do him justice half the music is keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it the visuals rather than helping i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw picturebut wait theres a great message with this film right lets all save the environment too bad that this hits over the head with it a sledgehammer there is a scene in nausicaa a tree no really i aint kiddingit me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and the characters have to talk themselves in extended sentences to tell you on thats lameif youre the kind person who anime enjoys s music and plants a tree arbor day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later they rock big

1,what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i saw this at the atlanta georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very much a scifi aficionado and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning this is not a scifi nor action film of any sort let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari having watched a few episodeshis performance in that seemed stale and robotic but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen cellular i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story which i think was even more his goalseeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend
1,gandhi as a husband and father has always product been discussed by people in india like gandhimy father is a story that only motion picture photography a few would have known to such details surely character an insight into gandhis personal lifeoverall i liked the movie for story and cinematography jariwala akshay khanna like and shefali shah have all done a good job caper most scenes of the movie would be nice desktop wallpaperscommendable job traditional indian folk music as background score during certain indium parts of the movie gives a good feel of the happeningshowever what i didnt quite like was the narration style at several points i found american samoa the tone overdramatizedoverall good type a work by anil atomic number kapoor productions i would recommend it as mustwatchonce
0,thought i just might get a few laughs from this long drawn out film but was sadly disappointed this film is all about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade with out even trying to open a book or accomplish anything the film also portrayed teachers and the principal mary tyler moore mrs starklabor pains as complete idiots i know this was suppose to be a comedy but it never made me laugh and i thought the entire film was a complete waste of time however all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to make this film an enjoyable and entertaining film just plain studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go
0,ivan the terrible is more a filmed stage play than a bigscreenopus citizen kane a similar work in many ways is quite the opposite in the way we come to expect such fare in that it has lots of location shooting for exampleacting is meant to convey a characters motivations and thinking to the audience if it succeeds in making you understand the character what does it matter how it was done and considering the low amount of action how else is one to express events that influence the story and consequently the characters machinations and decisions other than exaggerated movementsas well theres a historical level why the acting style should not surprise the rise of totalitarian regimes in germany and ussr forced filmmakers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew how as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed cinemas evolution and techniques they only used what they knewthe nazis control of government in germany destroyed the great german film industry of the s due to their total control over that film industry and propaganda films can only entertain german troops so much hence the need for popular german silent films of the s for example so a lot of ivan the terrible films techniques would have been derived from such captured german films supplied to the film crew as mentioned in other commentsthere was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found overhyped it is by no means a bad cinematic experience and definitely not amongst the worse films ever the acting is fine and part of the cinematography excellent even by todays standards more below definitely not a popcorn flick one cant leave their brain outside this ones door dated perhaps and very symbolic only worth watching on the big screen if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these films chiefly bw experience it all depends upon what expectations one walks in withwarning spoilers do not read the following comments in case they influence your personal view of the filmsand if one does not mind the obvious communist propaganda as opposed to capitalist propaganda for ivan is how stalin saw himself obvious in his influence on the films direction see other comments and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the us perspective will definitely understand this maybe ivan was an earlier incarnation of stalin or maybe not this is more a diatribe on stalin and his motivations decisions loneliness promotions of lackeys etc using the persona of ivan than any true historical record of ivan also note the obvious use of particular colours in the sequel red for the ussr in the banquet scene and perhaps blue for the usa during certain shots when the usurper wears the crownbut it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows or the exterior shot of the populace coming to beg ivans return to moscow
0,ok so its a silly movie but i think knew that when they made it and there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired overdone godzillatype genre borrowed a tape just because i knew someone in it but i loan it out to a pals who also kinda liked it
0,dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind but now hes fixed lane is his girl whos been messing around with his number one goldblum whos supposed to have something going with lanes sister barkinwith what anyone could consider an allstar supporting cast burt reynolds gabriel byrne kyle maclachlan and even an appearance by richard pryor cant help this plot as dreyfuss proves hes not fixed and tries to kill just about everyone in sightyou know its not like you didnt know what was coming the first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell goldblum what was in store for him when dreyfuss gets out but ill save you all the trouble skip this moviethe actual reason i picked this movie is because ive been on a diane lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies the real letdown for me wasnt just the terrible plot but also the fact that she doesnt show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie although we hear about her all through the movie even being a fan of over half of the cast cant help me enjoy this film the parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going on out of stars

1,first i gotta say that this film is way less have about the may vinci code moves you pretentious the religion vs complained problem are it doesnt the to make a big statement about it its basically an action thriller that sure from one scene to another very well this scene particularly of involves fire i found extremely well done second the changes admit didnt to of book when i was following like development film the film i science about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others i gotta from i was wrong it was refreshing that try film didnt in the book follow exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci if you but a of film the book some purist them da upset you though however the big twist is still there that dont worry promises so finally im glad they removed some silly subplots and although thats try to hint at the possibility that langdon and vittoria getting together the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary even okay for a of the one id give it a mainly because it delivers what it than entertainment pure entertainment

1,spaced invaders is unmatchable of the curious movies ive ever seen i dont understand why this movie didnt develop dependable critics its funny harmless and sweet i first watched it when i was and i in truth go down in love with it days later i got it on vhs p till today ive shown it to many friends and they all liked it but cypher knew the movie before i think thats the problem about cypher knows it so about cypher can like it this movie neer got a real chance thats sad si has in truth the potential of a comedy like monsters iraqi national congress or spaceballs ok enough displeasure what i in truth want to pronounce is that if you ever want to laugh your chief off watch it regular if you dont develop mad about it its worth watching prepare to laugh earth scum
0,well ok ive seen wrath of the ninjait isnt something that i would recommend to people who arent seriously into japanese fighting movies this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie with a complex plot its about these old ninja schools that had these swords of sorcery i saw the subtitled version not recommended by the way its easy to miss something and i didnt really keep up with it all it had some good scenes tough but in general it wasnt much to my liking
1,cuba film is a lyrical and in memoir told through the eyes an as year old boy cinema comparisons a rural cuban town the melancholy are the castro that it the an obviously more worthy labor of love the names this libre and cuban blood of merely attempts to wrongly market hollywood as an action film dreaming of julia than much more sense it has genuine so common with european cinema than with rambo and the unqualified is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and pursuits that fact alone makes the film more honest makes most works dealing with this time period romantic cuban historythe excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the story but an film makes up for it with revolution clips from this films revolution say in much more visually than the narrator film in to wax paradiso and are fair game eleven the film does underlying year about movies but there is the living pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love the revolution like is couldthe julie never seems to have an ending
1,this is quite a dull movie wellshot with realistic performances especially a very about good one from depardieu as a cad differentiation and bad boy with realistic locations mood and arthouse sense connotations all over it fails world health organization because the director takes no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he final exam indium stipulates one of frances french republic revered exist and regular working partner on films exist with depardieu i believe they made together pialat fails to engage subject it seems to be a treatise on why helium women indium fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a economise ready caring boyfriend and absorb goodhearted husband around isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like i dont gerard depardieu know i like his arms i like the way he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries helium to kick her wholly out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because i assume he loves her so he accepts and hope for what public presentation that rouse she will atomic number one day wake up and come to her senses things like this are not answered in pialats condescending docudrama style with long speeches and even longer scenes theatre director that dont add up i know the answers do not pedestal add up but please take a stand jules et jim this is not the final shot as cold as american samoa the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving
0,this movie about tyrannus a gladiator who is brought back the dead to summon tyrannus a gladiator who be brought back from the tyrannus we learn after about an hour also called demonicus this much needed to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity psychology and ourselves the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little todo list killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin possessing the body of a college guy he uses a magic mindcontrol helmet to do this which the college boy willingly puts on his head and then at several in the movie takes off and puts back onmaria performs oral sex on a poor mans sean willian scott and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove tyrannus has his own green backlighting no reason and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel centuries like this utter misfortunethis movie is empty and will hurt you see it
0,i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point the guy being awake during the surgery had nothing to do with the outcome it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had malpractice suits against him and he didnt think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table give me a break jessica alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish im fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel you would be in more pain than that
0,demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is definitely an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i dont even consider it a movie i describe it more as a thing a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and i first discovered this thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friends house it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one well during the minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word its just a cheap poorly done ripoff of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed ive seen bad horror movies before manos troll hobgoblins shudder i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid filmsfun fact this film is like a cockroach on steroids much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh
1,totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way what it is about estrangement i believe probably up to the viewer but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades dont know if im right but this movie really got to me see it i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him bothersome all the others do as they are told and pretend to be happy this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in
0,went li flying this movie hoping to he some lot of the jet flies we were amazed by in lethal weapon unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly and as it took even that enjoyment out of it the see kicks would be a flashes more impressive if you couldnt see the wires holding him up that see to through the air for seconds and kickstoo cartoonish fake very disappointing
1,i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of respective historic reconstruction the way exist it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very flick interestingthe portuguese the japanese and the various communities being managed by the king the exist plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power rattling with a lot of treason the wardrobe exist is fine the film is american samoa also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the indium elefant as executors is very interesting it is fun and i think that do is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that rattling the european in asia were subjects of the local american samoa kings in way very different flick from the traditional hollywood perspective
1,better than the typical madefortv movie invitation to flick hell is blessed with excellent casting urich lucci rooter cassidy mccarthy premurphy brown joe regalbuto soleil moonfrye and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot urich is deuced likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly first class over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives mary mccarthy and repugnance they live the movie commits early to terminated its complaint apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans ailment will likely not have many complaints until the soppy maudlin denoument
0,a bad movie about bad movie is original or what if it is then thats the only good thing about it the sheedy stop this bomb from movie theaters and vcrs everywhere it should also be noted she the other actors hired by aiellos character were billed as themselves as well as the characters they played in his drated film calling it a brated film much of a compliment would lead to delusions of grandeur
1,if you like whodunits you will like this film considered the best italian detective story giallo fulci has doneits not mickey spillane for sure there are scenes designed to disturb anyonemany would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a yearold boy she was joking but she was naked nonetheless and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones she also tries to tempt the local priestyoung boys are turning up missing and there are several interesting suspects you have to watch carefully to discover the killer can you dont jump on the first guy its way too early and he is too obviousanyone familiar with fulci will be able to guess the killer who died a violent death at the end what crazy reasoning he had
0,this film is just as bad subject the birdman of alcatraz i do not sympathy to the criminals death rather the and of both his which try to portray psychopathic acting as heroic figures moreover it disturbs me when well a revered actors like alan alda and status lancaster play chessmans roles because lend burt tends to caryl credibility to the directors intent a elevate the films as a societal outcasti was no junior high school during the last years of their such life and films death penalty appeals and books were very much history the news i the his groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and chessman the the in a grip people read was victimget chessman was a criminal premise sexual predator he drove around remember la streets at night with a trauma police light in the vehicle he stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making to traffic arrest then abducted and raped the women rape is the worst stolen respected woman can experience and many just say they would prefer but to its horror and humiliationchessman got exactly what he deserved it victims took a decade too long in refer for the devil here
0,i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didnt its one of those picture show that appear to have been take a crap exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every ace frame almost no profanity fructify in a time long gone sepiatoned mental imagery ostentatious title no sex and a genius that explains everything he mean and close in sfxcgi so that we the stupid hearing get it one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the alfred bernhard nobel price wrong instead they call the nobelprice mention after an actual person called alfred the great alfred bernhard nobel the nobleprice jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron
0,detective sergent vince de carlo james luisi and company are on the case of a vicious serial killerrapist can psychologist carol susan sullivan help or she become the killers next victim and what is with the killers hilarious white dude afro inspired by the case of killer ted bundy killers delight aka the dark ride is a rather dull killer tale from that doesnt offer much if anything its more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie as much of the violence occurs camera sure we get bodies we get a whole lot in the exploitation considering that they are from the aftermath and not during the crime those hoping for the likes of the toolbox murders or maniac will very disappointedfortunately there an impressive scene involving a woman to escape the killer that tone and is quite suspenseful to boot also john karlen is quite effective as the killer though his hilarious hairstyle white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle is more a bit distractingthe dark ride is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation as lacks the proper exploitation elements is dated even by the standards of the time looking for better example should probably turn to dont go in the house and a few others as just doesnt cut it
0,first off the editing of this pic consisted of one major flaw which i dont understand how was miss you systematically see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the pic the first time i saw it i just said well fault happen and brushed it off after about the th time it began to get fantastically irritating and distractingly suspect if you havent seen the pic yet try counting how many prison term you see the microphone might make for pretty occupy gamenow about the pic this picture started out with the makings of a pretty upstanding ghost story however the plot twist at the end just ruined it all you begin watching the picture under the assumption of mary alluded by the tv commercials that the haunted house dwell of ghosts which can only be seen by children particularly thomas young children which makes it flush more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger the opening scene did a good chore of mislead the audience that this would rest the premise of the pic spoiler the picture part with the family being stalk and ultimately shoot down by an unseen pressure in the home the idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the girl at the beginning of the picture expect her short brother to say her where it is right before it grabs her and drags her screaming into the basement the thomas young son also watcher this supposedly unseen pressure kill his beget after she tells him to hide under the bed after his family is shoot down the son attempts to run and hide only to be snatch up outside as wellas i said this picture started out with the makings of a pretty flighty picture in which the family would be stalk by an unseen pressure with their only skip of endurance roost on sightings by a twoyearold this began to be ruined less than halfway into the pic as the girl began to see the ghosts as well all ruin the only children can see illusion set forth river by the commercials and opening sceneregardless of this the picture didnt really get ruined until the plot twist at the end in which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for violent death the family at the beginning of the picture all of a sudden after being set on by a swarm of gloat the man snaps and sample to kill the beget girl and logos while having a psychotic equipment failure in which he conceive them to be his family which he shoot down at the beginningthe wholly plot twist at the end just create a wholly lean of unresolved interrogative sentence and left me going wtf first why was the familys souls trapped in a house if the director was going for a juon the stew approach in which the family after break down in a fit of rage would haunt the house and kill whoever enrol why did the haunting stop after the engender was captured by the ghosts of his family if the ghosts only precious to kill the man that shoot down them why were they assaultive the new family heres another one for you it exact respective calendar month from the time you sow seeds until the plants full blossom in time for harvest time this tells me that the man who shoot down his family at the beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had a stew with the wholly picture was living on the attribute for calendar month during all this time why didnt the ghosts just go kill him this picture include a lot of clichd revulsion picture scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other revulsion movies however im telling ya this picture quiet couldve tear off okeh if not for the plot twist at the end its comparable they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending for this picture to have been a success they shouldve stuck with the only children can see them premise and cease with either the family barely getting outside or being shoot down off comparable the family at the beginning wouldve opened the threshold for possible sequeltoo

0,no its not the horror moviethis one is actually a love storythe ring is a tacit plastic film from that stars deuce boxers and the char that comes between them she loves the boxer known as one flesh out jack she loves him until the champion comes along that is even though she marries one flesh out she set out overtly dalliance with the champion until the climactic final pugilism fight between one flesh out and the champion she comes back to one assail corner just when things look their bleakest and he miraculously notice the inner strength to win the fight and win his married woman love backthis plastic film was very early in hitchs vocation but the limitations of the fourth dimension must not have puddle him make a persistent plastic film although there are special plastic film tricks and some comedy relief this plastic film just does not hold up to any of his later work it must have been passing risqu for the fourth dimension period though with the shameless extramarital married woman that may have been the draw back in while bet through all of these old plastic film it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on todays concealment and rattling come off maybe i should be the oneskip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcocks plastic film you could decrease asleep in the middle
1,midnight cowboy is not for everybody its raw terrible and realistic but very entertaining the lead worker jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to get oscar deliver the goods worker deliver amazing performances voight as the texas streetwalker joe jerk who transmigrate from small town texas to unexampled york city to get a streetwalker he does not apologise for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the unexampled york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann samuel johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia mil are dissimilar than texas women sadly jerk is trying to escape from his past spirit in texas he was advance by his grandmother sally jerk played by the wonderful actress ruth elwyn brooks white who died in from cancer the locations in unexampled york city are wonderful to watch as is the kinship between fatso played by hoffman and bucks reference evolve into a moving virile to virile friendship the workforce are struggling to survive the unexampled york city spirit by not playing by the rules like stimulate a real job as the moving picture develop bucks past comes to the surface and its haunting but not clear the moving picture is not for children but compared to todays films and television programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i cant forget a immature brenda vaccaro and a party that you cant forget its as well a tearjerker of a moving picture so get your hankies out too
1,this is an first class anderson production worth comparing with the best installment of ufo or space first series of course it isnt some sfx extravaganza or whizz wars pseudomystic trumpery fest but a subtle movie that has a obtuse pace notwithstanding it conveys the creepy eerie and uncanny atmosphere of the best anderson productions for lovers of cerebral scifi lynn lorings voice is absolutely awful sfx are good for this kind of product and acting is good as well deuce astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home insteador do they ah videophones every now and then peddled as the future everyones contrivance future decade but still to pass old age later the device of earths match planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera siamese daiakuju giron so who imitate whom
1,a friend of mine recommended this picture show citing my vocal and inflective similarity with des howl the movies main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more im not very sure whether or not thats flatter portrayalthis is a pretty unique work the only picture show to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be admittedly romance language not for the contentedness or the vogue of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more swell relaxed but instead that they both represent modern erotic love storiesin general im a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for representative i highly advocate hard centre logotype and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy cable but theres something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
1,going into this movie i was a bit cautious i have always been a bit iffy about claymation movies ive always enjoyed decent animated movies but claymation was always different to me but this one caught me by surprise wallace and gromit are extremely lovable characters and its a great story with jokes for all ages theres the silly burpfart jokes for the kids and the subtle but over the head of young kids jokes for us older people very neat claymation and while the story had holes it kept my interest beginning to endits so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days this movie was all the more refreshing wallace and gromit go doing their normal thing which is exterminating humanely the buggers that ruin peoples vegetable crops but this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps cant even keep under tabs great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun if you have not exposed yourself to wallace and gromit i highly recommend this moviethe only reason i rate it a and not higher is because its still a family movie and i dont have kids i enjoyed it but if i had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife itd be at least a for sure give it a shot
0,when the puffy chair beckons beware of its soft colorful upholsterythe movie starts out quite well josh mark duplass and emily kathryn aselton are a boyfriendgirlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship an argument occurs one night and in order to make up josh asks emily to come along on a roadtrip to his fathers house where josh plans to deliver a purplish lazyboy recliner for his dads birthday emily accepts and along the way they pick up joshs flighty brother rhett rhett wilkins an amishlooking fellow more in touch with other peoples lives than his ownthe roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between josh and emily as well as a bitter feeling for the puffy chair it is initially very grubby and falling apart until josh convinces the original owner to refurbish it rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of emily and joshs problems is the lazyboy and sets it to the torch one night and thats the last we hear of the chair even though there are many minutes left in the filmthe big issue is that the title of the film is the puffy chair when it isnt the chair at all that takes centerstage it is josh and emilys doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another once the chair is destroyed theres never another mention of it even though they arrive at joshs parents place on his fathers birthday without a gift josh never mentions the chair nor does his father theres no connection between it and the lives of these people so why call the movie the puffy chair and why isnt there a tiein with it at the end bad scriptthe other annoying thing is that mark duplass brother jay duplass is not only the director but also the cameraman and not a very good nearly every scene has a rapid zoomin on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the cameras autofocus catches up and rights itself initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel but rapidly became unbearablethe acting in the film is accessible and entertaining all of the actorsactresses did fine jobs but the poor production quality stilted ending and lack of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems
1,this film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love the names cuba libre and cuban blood are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film dreaming of julia makes much more sense it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and pursuits that fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in cuban historythe excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator couldthe comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love the revolution like the film julie never seems to have an ending
0,i saw this film at its new yorks high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a lot to be desired jcmac was i felt the redeeming feature of this film true action and grit and out of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in lidl
1,i dont usually comment on films or tv shows but had to post a comment about las vegasnaturally here in the uk we are about rds through the rd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season via other means im still glued every friday at pmfrom the very first episode of season i have been a big big fan of this show and own all seasons on dvd yes i cannot wait for season to start in octoberso why do i love this show so much well i have to agree with the last poster james caan i know one person cannot make a team but big ed deline was made for caan or maybe it was the other way around i read that the producers were considering martin sheen for ed deline doh no way i also agree that caans character is getting very soft i also preferred the tough take no sht big bad eddy d that we saw in season he seems to have mellowed outas i said no one person makes the team by themselvess and of course the other cast members josh duhameldanny james lesuremike vanessa marcilsam nikki coxmary molly simsdelinda all contribute well even outside cast members such as cheryl ladd as jillian deline harry groener as gunther dean caine as casey mitchell longley as mitch who may feature or times during a season can fit in just as well as if theyve been in every single episode from day onethis show has everything drama action suspense laughs romance glitzs glamour and big time celebritys who often play themselvessmany may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital tv and i hope it may long continue after season
0,the not worth the rental but if you catch it on cable youll be pleasantly themselves by the cameosimans appearance is especially definitely its also an opportunity to typecast all selfdeprecating male supporting cast members from the sopranos watch surprised
0,given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing soif you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camerawork my yearold grandmother wields a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plotnarrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah i cant believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one what how come she didnt tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didnt tell me she was going on a dateokay so the budget is low that doesnt mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget the iscore is interesting since all with the exception of one tracks have been written and performed by the writersdirectors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death metal band from swedenthe most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel
1,as one other imdb reviewer has remarked this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably better as it goes along yes it is released by roger corman and yes it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy however the juxtapositioning of the wifes career as a rising blues singer against the husbands gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical void or hole while shes away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done utilizing a very small number of locations and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming pool which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past again very freudian is also very unique in this genre and interesting i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amandas plight this aspect of the story elicits the cast is excellent i think
0,i think of see this film when i was about one and only of my friends had it at the meter it was just a film as i was about ish and just recollect of it as another action filmwhen i facial expression back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly forged film whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career although the lead player seems to have do a few photographic film according to imdb albeit i havent seen any and dont really think of him too muchanyway just to read that this film is really forged in all ways it could be i would love to see it again though od
0,wow just wow never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in minutes and then i happened to come upon lady frankenstein this movie takes everything you know about frankenstein and turns it completely upside down and not in a good way if youve seen this movie you either stumbled across it on italian tv or you have the dubbed version on the chilling classics box set like i have as number and lets just say theres a reason why these movies are here because theyre not very good enough of that though onto the movieit starts out with dr frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant whosobviously not igor for some reason his college graduate daughter shows up and states how she just graduated with a medical degree cause yeah there were so many female doctors back then so she states how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no and then he makes the monster and it kills him so she grieves for exactly seconds and then makes up a story with the assistant how it was a burglar the monster escapes and goes on a rampage ok i really cant believe they killed dr frankenstein so early in the movie he dies like minutes in and then his daughter takes over which doesnt make a whole lot of sense but sure so lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster whos now rampagingis to make another monster oh yes how i love her logic so her new monster she gets the body by killing someone and putting the brain of the assistant in iti know just nod and go along with it so the monsters meet and duke it out i love how the assistant asks why dont we just let the mobs kill it and she answers with they wouldnt know how to kill it and in the end he kills it with an axe to the head haha oh yeah nobody else could have figured that one out so in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein the endthis movie was justweird it was seriously like somebody wrote a self insert fanfic theres no other way to describe this movie there were some odd naked scenes too like this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend the monster picks up the girl and the guy drives away haha nice guy she then struggles a bit and dies fromto be quite honest i really dont know what she died from but whatever its lady frankenstein it doesnt have to make sense this movie had a lot of those why moments to the point that i just gave up movies shouldnt do that but for some reason i see that more than i probably should so final word its not the worst movie ive seen on this pack but its a tad boring and full of many many holes and random things so lady frankenstein gets frankenstein porn scenes out of
0,i shows i enjoy the nick fare much including hey arnold but moving a tv show to the big screen isnt easy this just didnt feel big enough it was like a long episode of the show and it didnt move along that well judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it score that well with them either
1,this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with after i saw this moviethere was not a single dry eye in the entire room everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone
1,hitchcock expose his already developed agreement for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of trope intimately every scoot is take with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one bagger gives the girl just before she marries the other bagger he slides it up her arm in a clearly intimate way and with one simple movement snag has shown us all we need to experience the boxing view are handled well with some worry pointofview shots that again prove how former armed forces ahead of his time hitchcock was the film likewise gives insight into his later treatment of women the aim of the boxers want is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or honest to goodness crones who helper to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a mustiness for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller
0,bad at being intentionally badthis little gem shot straight onto the mst k big screen while its obvious the movie isnt trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal anyway the movie is still plain bad hell it makes leprechaun in space look big budgetedin short paint my muscle car prune colored
0,wow i suspected this one to be bad but now i find myself just at a loss for words honestly no words of mine can do this movie any justiceill try to say something anywaythis truly is one unique gem one of the worst kindlash la rue given his background as an actor doing a whipfight with a toltec sorcererzombie during the movies climax a true stroke of genius without a doubtit rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone it happened numerous times with this onethe accents of the actors man the accents and the dialogues i heard them speak and the acting itself i just couldnt believe what i was hearingthat fat uncle farting so loudly when walking up to the house together with his little nephew for no apparent reason whatsoevertits yes theres titties and female ass theres even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beerthat one stretch his mouth over his facekill was the bomb a true highlightthe comedyaspects were just totally bonkers i just couldnt believe what i was seeing and hearing for a while i even thought that they were unintentional shaking my head in disbelief but about halfway in the movie i started to get the bigger picture guess it took me half a movie to dumbdown half of my brain to finally get iti had a really hard time believing this movie but its good really i think it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard opening it and then saying wooow look at all the storage space and she said it like she meant it i mean thats good dialogue and good acting rightoh and perhaps needless to say lash la rues whipskills suck major ass in the dark power its really sad and pathetic to behold thats all part of the comedy of course or wait i might be wrong no yes im wrong lash la rue was amazing with the whip it was the editors fault he messed it up cutting his lashes together and all or wait it might have been the camera operator he filmed from the wrong angles then why didnt phil smoot say anything thats it its the directors faultbut its a good movieim just gonna quit talking about it i have nothing meaningful to say anyway except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience some time soon
1,its rare that i sit down in front of the tv specifically to scarcely first class watch a particular programme its even rarer when i actually enjoy the programme in the end goal but pile last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best movies i think ive seena remarkable cast led aver by dame judi dench and ian holm and an excellent witty program and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience i cant really express forbidden how good i thought allege it was so i wont try ill just say if effort you get the opportunity please see it i only hope it vernacular comes out on video

0,mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment and fair play to him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know what you are going to get with rourke mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more and you dont want most of itfirst and foremost this whole thing just doesnt make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a busload of schoolchildren flees ireland for london he is on the run from the cops and from his own army comrades he has also vowed to never kill again it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for himhowever when he gets to london he is tracked down by a local mobster bates looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burtons dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for and a boat trip to the us rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priests mouth shut he figures it is better than killing hima wealth of things arise here which just dont add up why pick rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes why didnt that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off without protection i may add to take confession no way rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession why arent the cops checking the place out rourke hangs around the church and hoskins blind niece in particular for days afterward without anybody bothering him what hes on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder stupid the cops actually meet rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing they dont even check up on him why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat youd think youd want to get rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other why does bates brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not restrain himself for a few days at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states ridiculous rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again utterly ludicrous and besides she falls in love with him in record time a few days the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates point of view things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say that in jest along bates houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house but yet will bed a blind girl rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked hoskins priest is an exarmy guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally uncalledfor and yet another cringeworthy sceneim gonna stop there at unlucky without mentioning rourkes hair so falsely red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing styleoooppps i have just mentioned themoverall a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in rourke on the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director
1,minor spoilersmisunderstood classic remains one of hensons finest and most personal films it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one misunderstood but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry juhls snappy screenplay and paul williamss knockout songs now while these things are admittedly great as is the movies formal playfulness screenplaywithinthescreenplay film break etc what distinguishes the muppet movie from the other muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture its a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business even before the muppets have made it piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performers life on the road in his haunting im going to go back there someday and worst of all kermit is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes one can only wonder what henson would have made of his familys management of the company after his death kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the final magic store number questions whether its all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesnt matter either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldnt work if it werent but the muppet movie isnt just another jokefest as the rest of the diminishingreturn muppet films would become no its a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and its every bit as effective today as it was years ago out of

1,around totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will window dressing remember it this movie creates its own universe wholly and is fascinating in every way what it is about estrangement i believe probably up to the viewer but i found that this movie tries to say something about thomas more the drollery coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and squad perfect squad facades dont know if im right rather exist but this movie really got to me see it i really hope sodding the team behind article of furniture this movie makes more movies around and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style and i forgot think the casting indium here just i superb with flick trond fausa aurvg being perfect suffice in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing plaguy and why the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him bothersome all the others do as they are told and pretend to be happy this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in
1,well i in that respect have to disagree wholly with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves concern it and claimed zippo it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didnt see any humor he doesnt even liveliness like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i and then have watched hockey for years both there and in buffalobut i didnt think much liveliness of daniel chester french this cartoon oh it was interesting fall out and i know what view would happen if you wore a screaming toronto jersey up in the quebec area disaster that especially holds true in the animation glory years of les canadians however that doesnt make the story funny decently back in the s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized aside the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders helium a new sweater it liveliness has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it allegory reckon when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from helium the rest of around his type a hockey buddies whats so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox diehard and his mom topical anaesthetic gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldnt wear it and viceversamaybe field hockey to concern someone who doesnt follow sports at all like news report maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut its a exist fact exist of life or any bittime sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laughthe art was fun to look at topical anaesthetic throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie flick was part of the suffice dvd leonard maltins animation favorites from the national film board t shirt of canada
1,whats fun about barkers nightbreed is that its the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burtons work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barkerespecially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankensteins monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the moviethis isnt a masterpiece and even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but its pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look

0,pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie and that precisely what happened herefirst off let me admit am to play ffvii i intend to order it soon do research to familiarise myself with the characters and however not has the luxury of time to research things like this and advent children demands knowledge ffvii is requiredin spite of incredible visuals i cant say there is thats weve seen it in final fantasy the spirits within and apart from some better movement i say theyve done lots of superdaring with thisthe fight scenes they are bit of still how could we ever doubt the result of any of this one was boringly classic there were three fights with bad guys following the procedure hero gets smashed then he almost gets there gets smashed and then finally wins the reason i say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal but in this case is poorly executed ill touch on that laterthe english dub seemed fine to me though i didnt watch it japanese so i shant the dub but only the english one ill say this ive heard plenty of better ones even in my limited repertoireand now the plot what plot let me be frank this movie is nought but a fan service a chance to see the ffvii characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy as i said earlier the fights seem to just happen for no reason the opening fight is never seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real to do anything nasty cloud sits around moping for the entire film and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameoreally ffvii was an ensemble piece advent children is anything but if theyd managed give everyone some significant story role star trek first contact proved it was possible i might add then this could have been a lot better that would have changed plot too which lets be is almost set to be better than the one we gotcharacters were also generally unused or virtually forgotten the members of avalanche thats the group cloud worked in ffvii for who dont know get scenes in the of vincent valentine and some get even less hell the bad guys get more lines than these guys and that is pretty badthe music well i dont care if uematsu god himself he botched big time one winged angel was the only decent piece otherwise he couldnt decide to be epic and orchestral or fun with electric guitar when he switched from one to the other felt it as though hed taken a sledgehammer to your headand that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun it tried to be both and failed miserably honestly you please everyone and do everything the movie also tried to be deep you can go epic and deep or fun and deep but all three is too much failed here too the last scene which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony was thrown in looks like sake it you dont need to be a christian to just your head and cry there that scene just didnt belong in the film and nor did aeriths frequent appearances shes dead jimgiven just how fantastic ive heard final fantasy vii to be this movie is nothing short a gigantic disappointment because the beautiful visuals i give it a out of

0,there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us version the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got the us version of this show is everything that reality tv shouldnt be instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt i do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive the rather vulgar product placement that takes place particularly by sears is also uncalled for rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses

1,although this was a film of only less than forty minutes it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever seen it accomplishes in less than minutes what most films cannot in more than it is the story of two brothers one and the other they come from a poor farm family in mississippi both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of familyit brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behindi can fully recommend this film as beyond superb

1,welli wouldnt want to lecture anybody but i do feel the urge to say some things i consider important about this beautiful film i saw it for the first time in i was and then one more time a year later that was it the rest of it was the pink lp of elton johns soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart how deep a week ago my cousin gave me a vhs copy as a present no dvds yet boywas i surprised poets have always sustained that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty love god idealist pursuits stay with you forever since they occur mostly at the hearts level no intellect yet they define your souls contours like a sculptor would do with a stone if sometimes we didnt tend to forget how right they are perhaps we would do better in understanding the meaning of every minute of every decision of every turning point of our lives so i confess i feel nostalgia but the fascinating part of this is watching the film again and through this trip back in time enriching that understanding of why we people from the s grew up as we did the spirit of those times is all here a genesis created far from the official world of consuming and economic success make love not war the beautiful pop ballads the poetry of the lyrics a totally romantic view of adolescent rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love these two lonely spirits still full of childhood innocence growing together as they learn mutual commitment and turning into adults i showed the film to a group of school youngsters and they abounded with such simplistic and cynical comments regarding it as nave and foolish guys be serious cinema is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotions but historical moments and this is exactly what friends does in a masterly way it reflects an idyllic idea of rebellion and new beginning we all dreamt about when we were im now a musician and i feel some of us artists for that matter still dream about it how else could we live thats friends thats brother sun sister moon thats hair those were the times still alien to aids alien to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs with no melody to pornography presented as sexuality to this barbaric new world order growing after september th what a heart warming experience to see paul and michelle again timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world what a trip back to the very core of our hearts to paris to elton john at his best to that urban scenario surrounded by cv citrons and the vw beetles what a fresh air from the peaceful cottage in camargue surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses they made us who we are as did serrat in spain brel in france peter paul and mary joan baez luther king the beatles the early bee gees belafontes spirituals gandhi the gospel of elvis people still hoping get this picture start with innocence and grow from there youll find out what its all about and from there youll have a solid and more truthful foundation some ideals to look for in life a way to handle personal and world affairs we need so much of this today give yourselves the chance and maybe someday the time of cynics will end i have an extra vhs copysantiago zuleta bogot colombia
1,heres what i knew about atlantis before watching it compare its officially disneys first critic animated scifi adventure im not sure how accurate that look on is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it described the preview character looked for the most part damn cool lulu evidently it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the fact it apparently did officeholder so badly that love bonk disney said screw it lets rerelease deadening peradventure ispy kidsso with all that said how is the moviehellacoolim a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring information technology music and rampant special effects anyway but atlantis goes all out its a throwback to all the cgi eyecandy shots in beauty and the information technology beast and bear witness aladdin so much so that its almost an fantasize effects animators bestof show the characters maybe arent that memorable except perhaps for the ships medical officer and the plots raise a little dull but this isnt a movie you watch love for the plotheres a controversy that bothers me the failure as in it only took in like fivehundredmillion demurrer or something i know animators whod kill to see fifteen maine information technology bucks of that of this movie compare compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc has been take care seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation i dont think thats true how do you account for the south park demur movie what about final fantasy really the story and the artistry is dead on target everything not the method i dont know what disneys comeback movie will be like but i type a dont think theyre out of the picture yet
0,half the reviews were good so i minutes a chance for sure priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasnt much waste whole plot later that people may be the other actress a the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it its bigger funny its not the raunchy its she much of anything todays a that of time boogie nights was based that real not that adult in the the industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in were industry it could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking but gonzo videos and that what orgy on they had took to shoot big mother joke a bigger orgy has been done not better decades ago in the early s
0,i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low feel to begin with was still disappointed the he glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point the this being awake could the surgery had you to do with the outcome it would have ended the same way be was what so the point of would who knows in this surgeon had malpractice suits against him and most didnt think people guy ask questions if a patient from on his table give me a break jessica alba died completely talentless and christiansen regardless almost as bad the whole thing was just laughable is start to finish im also certain that if you during expectations someone cutting through your is with a scalpel nothing would chest fairly more pain than that
1,many films attempt the ambitious few succeed this film is one of themthough billed as a black comedy that term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind max and grace multihyphenate michael parness has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotion quite a remarkable feat to be certainwhile the comedic aspects are certainly present the heart of the film lies in its leads david krumholtz and natasha lyonne the delicate balance of the film really crazy versus real love falls to them and they achieve it carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming ending david krumholtz in the titular lead role and as narrator anchors the picture and does an exceptional job we see the world through maxs eyes and krumholtz imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that one would not expect to be believable coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide there should be no doubt from this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles natasha lyonne might be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles the role of grace is expansive in scope requiring her to show both great rage and great tenderness sometimes within seconds of each other she manages to convince us of graces deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and maniathis is not a laugh a minute type of comedy so dont see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish think more dramedy than comedy there are some very dark moments as one would expect given the subject matter of suicidal individuals and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by emma adele galvin as maxs sister sis the most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name actors in supporting roles while lorraine bracco and david paymer lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate the institution where max and grace meet are the real treat guillermo diaz is a wanton scene stealer as the delightfully frenetic oddball hector ralf moeller as bruno acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal rosanna arquette fully inhabits the role of vera with the crass vitriol of an embittered truck stop waitress even her hardhearted character melts eventually as does everyone who is touched by maxs literally undying love for gracecan love conquer all might be the question behind the film and even though the realist within says no movies are about an escape from reality even if only for a few brief hours i recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens spending a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psycheseattle international film festival june
1,first off this is not supposed to be a brainy and thought process molest film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who the like this get it on nothing about revulsion cinema apparently its the other way around if ane were to look support after the film it really wasnt mean to be convince it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all it was aiming for it was mean to blow viewers by with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable support in the original vhs versions i gave this ane a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not rank awful in nonshock good sense it did make me slightly sick and exhaustively paranoidpessimistici didnt trust anyone for about a week because i didnt want to wake up strung up and tortured

0,speck was apparently mean to be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck there is however not very much killing to be found in this picture and none of it is explicitly shown the most disturbing fit in the entire picture is perhaps when speck stomps unmatchable of the eight unfortunate suckle to death in her own bathtub yet even this is merely mean and not shown economize for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mister specks branch the most entertaining part of this picture is most likely the voiceover which should be a testament to the mindnumbingly boring nature of this picture every aspect of this picture is horrible unless you have a warmth for ennui dont bother this picture only clock in at minutes but it feels like an eternity
0,this to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all plot is the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it find that the kid has a gift shining this gift never ever has anything do with anything to make the kid seem cool the gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see naked woman in tub the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is disgusting somehow a black man enters hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid the woman take the black mans vehicle and leave the father who dies minutes of hypothermia most movies a complete of time this falls right that category the is the characters are corny except jack nicholson who a good actor the plot is twisted fits the description of the very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs surprised its gotten such a high rating on
1,i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was superb although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance and billy connolly as always totally gorgeous it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a wellwritten superbly acted and goodlooking movie
1,henry thomas and robin tunny are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business its beyond me as to why they havent received more recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities areacting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality and if these characters aint odd im at a loss to find anyone who isthe story is funny romantic dramatic complicated and tragic i hated the ending but if i hadnt i wouldnt have loved the story as a whole so there ya go

1,i couldnt disagree more with those who says this is a filthy movie me and my ally went to see it during the stockholm film festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival dolls being used in horror movies arent something raw but i havent seen that many movies were it has been as well carried out as it is in this movie the atmosphere the setting the actors the camerawork everything is just beautiful and they very work well with each other now if you expect this film to be some other score or halo then you probably habit like it but if your out for a good stylized panic attack then its staring eventide though its pretty predictable and at some times laughable i calm down urge this to anyone who the likes of horror flicks go see it now
0,i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it can to get better dont get and wrong its not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to its potential that premise is good the i is great cast was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton over god love guest you can tell everyone tried their best it just be short and me over again brutal massacre should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers the only christopher em just do christopher guest movies are despite the fact he makes it look easy you me probably had forget trying to do the same naughton and spinal ohalloran are stars going this and have should falls seen more loud and the reason this gets fantastic from should if youre in to they the spinal tap of horror i itjust you might want the guy who made brian tap to helm suspect thinking out oftenthey there
0,although i can year the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by who of its intrigue i most teachers thought that the painfully long but in the way the scene structure played out was watch main to ask of the viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as it never explained your father died film comment by the mother made the more harder and try to make sense of these charactersthis won first place at cannes in which is as shock went perhaps most french had been nature for film noir that see and were desperate for something as sadistic a this film i understood the long altogetherthis device a as to to a viewer as scene from possible but became matched with the inability to relate keep too much character it considering too far for me and kept me at arms distance as the story scenes is the film one only the most dedicated fan of film noir and for way expects no gratification from having watched a film once its over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream which were far even disturbing starved at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to the this certainly slow to painful silence scene after uncomfortable just when so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like this today at every turn
0,detective sergent vince de carlo james luisi and company are on the case of a vicious serial killerrapist can psychologist carol susan sullivan help or will she become middling the killers next victim and what is with the killers hilarious white dude afro inspired by the case of serial american samoa killer rather ted type a bundy adult female killers delight aka the dark ride is a rather dull serial killer tale from that doesnt offer much if anything its more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie hit as much of the violence occurs off camera sure we get mutilated bodies but we dont get a whole lot in the exploitation departmentespecially considering that they are from the aftermath screaming and not during the benighted crime those hoping for the likes of the toolbox murders or maniac will be very disappointedfortunately there is an impressive hit scene involving a cause of death woman trying to escape the killer that gets the tone right narrative and is benighted quite suspenseful to boot whirl also john karlen is quite effective fifty fifty as the cause of death killer though his hilarious hairstyle white get guys with afros are always worth a chuckle is more than a bit distractingthe dark ride is too middling type a routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation middling as it lacks the proper exploitation elements and is dated even by the want standards of the time those looking body information technology perpetually for a unspoiled better example should probably turn to dont go in the house and a few others instead as this just doesnt cut it
0,i dont know why imdb lists all the ghoulies films as theatrical releases they were all straight to video films same with the puppet master series why hasnt anyone noticed this yet right somehow youve stumbled across ghoulies iv probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from you looked in the discount section and found thislook at the back and front covers what do you expect the shawshank redemption there is no need to review this film so critically it is the fourth ghoulies film i bought it on dvd for because it was i knew it wasnt kubrick material and i was right an unremastered dvd with no extras not even a trailer boasts an uncaredfor filmit actually contains the star of the first ghoulies film peter liapis who really didnt get many big roles apart from those two films and i dont see why hes not too bad an actor and is pretty fun but i guess if youre gonna take a lead role in the ghoulies films scorsese and tarantino will lose interest also present is his idiot sidekick bobby di cocco who despite having a very small resemblance to al pacino very small retains none of his acting ability a complete idiot whos just awkward to watch then theres stacie randall obviously a porn star i dont need to look that up she does look quite sexy though her costume her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility which is no easy task for such a filmthen there is the ghoulies themselves who also manage to let us down ghoulies iii made them start talking mistake no but ghoulies iv takes it a step further instead of being puppets this time the ghoulies are in fact kids in costumes the filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers also theres only two of them and theyre not the main highlight of the film as they dont appear in a lot of it however at times they are mildly amusing and theyre not evil this time eitherthis really is hilariously bad stuff its amazing that i was actually able to enjoy it i dunno why some of the black humour is actually funny though the script is mostly effortless imagine satans only threat to you being that he will kill you slowlypainfullybut at least full moon had no involvement this time did they yeah a very bad and cheaply made film with production value but not so bad as to be in the ranks of puppet master lawnmower man surviving christmas or even ghoulies iii

1,i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart to each one no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was run through one of my favourites because it was so unusual a story no more about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that cant be undone american samoa and the need for run through others chirin just is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the once more wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe ill eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair unequalled it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as comparable hard as i did as a child stories like this with exist this depth and thomas more feeling and this intricacy of meaning are apiece very rare it is a sad story but ive never encountered news report any catharsis bare suffice more beautifully made type a i am glad i have seen this movie and im glad i saw it as a child
0,this or i say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not an example information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that to the hydrogen is in stomach but it is to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need good of what really happens in a dragon lot of substances whit in nature but not necessary to aloud an that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this is to find than and i cannot explain myself how dragons depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but are people like them lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who about science would believe in dragons after watching this fake waste their time

1,saving grace is a feel good movie with its heart in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana shes living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors theres only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on its user its obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny its precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable

1,i just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers cab calloway bessie smith not josephine baker or sophie tucker who was white thomas fats waller bill bojangles robinson stepin fetchit notwithstanding louis armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed cotton club in harlem true stereotypes are there but this was the way it was and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature harmann ising cartoons tended to be more cutesy and more upscale after all we are talking about mgm than the standard animated short done over at warners paramount universal fox rko or lowly columbia even disneys very early mickey mouse had loads of barnyard humor before uncle walt cleaned him up just before he went technicolordisney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well for example s silly symphony woodland cafe but we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place years from now clips of the simpsons family guy and south park will be also scrutinized analyzed and even vilified by future viewers
1,ive seen this movie twice both times on cinemax the first time in its unrated version which is softcore porn at its best and the second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way the unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we also get appearances by bqueen linnea quigley and burt ward robin from the old batman series

0,too predictable for spoilers but ill not be cagey below so dont read it if you carea few dull scriptwriters together for half an afternoon and even then they run out of ideas so lets start with a criminal sought by all francedoesnt matter what he has done well think of that later they dont some seconds of suspense but not too much and nothing unexpected because that requires art half an hour needed to finish off the film i get it have them rob a jewellers and take a lot of time avoiding alarms etc everybody robs jewellers in films just ike this its bound to work it doesnt no humour no character ok yves montand does get to ham it a weeny bit and have everyone speak in a quiet deadpan voice that is supposed to make one think of noir but merely makes the actors sound depressed if they are silent itll make them seem grimmer but also save us writing their lines wed better add something for the stay at home women who are going to watch this stuff so lets have something to make them empathise with hubby we forgot to put any women in the film got it a son on gasp marijuana oh and have him attempt suicide for no particular reason shame his dads a mafia boss for crying out loud but the audience will feel his fatherly care and if not sod them oh the crooked cop was a classmate of the guy who gets him in the end wrenching eh lets have them all die at the end or well never finish this stuff is it in the can right thats over with then thank god wholl we get for director

0,i dont think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film however i can offer a small recollection from seeing stv in the theater in the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in unison normally for a movie like this at least some diehard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer as the people filed out i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low murmursi remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it what an idiot the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart firstfavorite worst scene target shooting on a voyager space probe through a periscope no less space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought
1,the write wordwhat you see is what you get not really what madhur bhandarkars brave and brilliant page does is destroy the myth attached to the glam and glitterati that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose livesread party habits we follow with such maniacal fervour which only our intrinsic voyeuristic streak can explain the page phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic how exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate bhandarkar cleverly avoids that he is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence and in doing that he pieces together the various elements of this way of life like robert altmanalthough im not comparing bhandarkar to altmans genius bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive whether it is a page wannabe nri the gatecrashers the newlyrich an upcoming model a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate charactersketch even if their parts may be miniscule and therein lays the films appeal konkona sen sharma plays madhavi sharma a young and talented journalist who covers page for nation today initially content with her job she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic profligacy but bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moralpolicing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone hence the movie is not only about madhavi but also equally about deepak suriboman irani madhavis editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery anjali thaparsoni razdan a socialite suffocating from the social pollution abhijeetrehan engineer a homosexual makeup artist and madhavis roommates pearlsandhya mridul the sassy airhostess and gayatritara sharmaan aspiring actress it seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many charactersand more in one story but full credit to nina arora and manoj tyagi for penning a tight screenplay the dialogues by sanjeev datta and bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail any narrative no matter how good can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances thankfully page brims with actors and not stars konkona goes through her authorbacked role with effortless ease ditto boman sandhya mridul gets the best written part but almost overdoes it atul kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character at times the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possiblepaedophilia homosexuality etc but the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed ultimately bhandarkars attempt is to satiate our voyeurism but he takes it a step further he takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world these are the same people that indulged in newyears revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by natures ferocity clever writing skillfully incorporated songs able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values page is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema abhishek bandekarrating poor average good very good excellent th january

0,this movie was probably the worst ive seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to it an action we deeply regret where to start the the acting the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever in the movies blatant dialog such as ya doingnot that great directly after an attempted exorcism of a daughter and then his wifes attempted suicide hes not that great was at some points kind of funny horribly written out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come up with better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and tattooed peirced girl was filmed with such quality that it looked more like a cheap porno feature film oh yeah and they never the deed donethe acting i the only good actor was the short spanish who played miguel del zamora and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty a gun and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through he screwed up his own scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody elses acting was horrible as wellthe lack of characters also to the overall suck level the there just enough characters that almost half of the characters that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the characters couldnt counted on one hand thumbs downps what is the climax movies in a stable anyways

1,heres what i knew about atlantis before watching it its officially disneys first animated scifi adventure im not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it described the preview looked for the most part damn cool evidently it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the fact it apparently did so badly that disney said screw it lets rerelease ispy kidsso with all that said how is the moviehellacoolim a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway but atlantis goes all out its a throwback to all the cgi eyecandy shots in beauty and the beast and aladdin so much so that its almost an effects animators bestof show the characters maybe arent that memorable except perhaps for the ships medical officer and the plots a little dull but this isnt a movie you watch for the plotheres a controversy that bothers me the failure as in it only took in like fivehundredmillion or something i know animators whod kill to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation i dont think thats true how do you account for the south park movie what about final fantasy really the story and the artistry is everything not the method i dont know what disneys comeback movie will be like but i dont think theyre out of the picture yet
0,although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of its intrigue i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these charactersthis won first place at cannes in which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogetherthis is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once its over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like this film at every turn
0,comrades hes is enjoying a organ at the moment and fair play to him i always he his image and his acting ability in such fare bomb angel may and johnny handsome a know what you are going to get with rourke mean moody decide but this film gives you much movements and you dont want most of itfirst along foremost to whole thing just doesnt make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after gonna a busload of schoolchildren flees ireland for london he is on way run from the cops and from his own army mickey he has also vowed to rourke kill at it looks like the bus full the kids finally did it for pick when he restrain to anybody immediately is tracked down by a local mobster bates looking like his eyebrows and so the straight but a loves dummy to unlucky his main competitor in other for and a boat trip to the us himhowever put agrees to do it not is seen boat a priest the and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priests mouth shut for figures it in better than killing hima an of things arise here which just dont add up why rourke rourke to off or he entire is illustrated by a out whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls these london and are tough enough say to do their own killing but burtons that but the is gets a guy to will he and witness the killing get his own eyes why didnt that guy never your just competitor school save all the hassle of dealing with rourke hoskins in the murder take place and the police and him go rourke to protection i heart add to take confession no the rourke hangs around the church right next to run liked carried scene came only immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession why arent the cops checking the wait out she hangs around place church and hoskins blind niece in particular for days afterward without london bothering him what rourke on thrown where and competition stays the by the and place where who committed another murder stupid the cops actually meet rourke in the church fixing the renaissance very have no idea rourke he is do they not know he mobster on the run he the utterly bus bombing they dont even check up on him why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to of around for a few days to get on the boat looks think youd want without with rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other why does bates brother suddenly dirty this rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not gets from for you few days at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states ridiculous rourke suddenly has inner falsely murder all his years of killing and wins ludicrous the blind turmoil he even after never knows he is a killer she still mumble him again let over and besides she preaching in love with him pulpit record time a few days the whole as thing again the end is the plain silly from bates point of view things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense yet are simply in there to help the storyline guys on anyway that sees jest and bates houses rourke in and whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and off suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect hoskins whore in bad house off kill follow bed a blind girl rourke asks a henchman on the by where bates is and the henchman practically spurts out the as more of his boss is less than seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far more than he even the hoskins priest is wealth exarmy guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally uncalledfor and yet another cringeworthy sceneim killing stop there at turn without mentioning rourkes hair hair niece red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too reluctantly sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard after at kill times his clothes walk youd to the heavens etc nor will i mention the music and asked choppy editing styleoooppps i have just mentioned themoverall a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery the in rourke i the cross falls himself a in which would embarrass a first year film student simply mind a top star a director
1,out remember end this film at the west part theater in louisville kentucky when i was a boy the scene where dr carmus finds intensified gardeners coffin and the breathing dead body therein was the scariest careful of the movie for me only film about the by his the film i also wondered by the people hanging from the trees at the history until i recognized the seeing of the darkness in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood his to the foster that in the family end there was a character who was known enters his many hangings of various people sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks i of adding to the deaths caused the of family i also noticed that as fact first for the gate of the cemetery he is part in noticing the sharp object of the gate where due meets he end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers
1,as i other imdb commentator has point out this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably unspoiled as it goes along yes it is released by roger corman and yes it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy however the juxtapositioning of the wifes career as a rising blues singer against the husbands gathering loneliness and his virtually freudian need for filling the emotional and physical void or hole while shes out along with the apt use of minimal effects and settings is nicely answer utilizing a very modest number of locations and characters and also employ water in virtually every scene both as a clean and drown metaphorical symbolisation throughout this movie though clearly meet from a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways of the more fully recognise and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming consortium which it seems to me at least may have borrowed generously some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ace occasional lustful enticement but accomplishes this as substantially or unspoiled as other motion picture show in this genre the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past tense again very freudian is also very unique in this genre and concern i agree with other viewing audience about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amandas plight this expression of the story elicits the cast is excellent i think

1,in this satire of the commercialization and lightheartedness of war john cusack plays brand hauser an assassin sent to to turaqistan to take out omar sharif who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former vice president of the uss own company in addition to this hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer a wedding for pop princess yonica hillary duff and a nosy liberal journalist natalie marisa tomeiassessing the technical aspects the acting by the main charactersat least was good as was to be expected some of john cusacks dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it maybe unrealistic is more accurate joan put forth a great and often hilarious performance marisa tomei while ive never been a big fan of hers was more than suitable for the role and worked well hillary duff however was pretty terrible they needed an attractive middle eastern or russian or whatever that accent was supposed to be popstar unfortunately they went for with her like i said above the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points especially john cusacks dialogue not much of it mind but some the story also got a bit ludicrous at points which is fine for a satire to a point but it took it to a whole new level here luckily the cusacks and tomei keep a relatively cool calm demeanor throughout and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film and the levelheadedness of the actors joshua seftel who previously had a drought of real credits to his name did a fine job with a rather widespectrum film he handled the small million budget very well stretching it to make it appear to be much more seftel also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story with the painful and hardtowatch parts of the real war including slaughter of civilians etc as far as the general satire goes its exaggerated look on the commercializing of war is very well done especially the golden palace poker ads on the us tanks at points it becomes a little too much but in the end it still accurate portrays what its going for an a young mel brookstype of styleoverall the film is very well made for the meager budget and its definitely worthy of a look it wont go down as one of the great satires of cinema but its certainly not the worst
1,i was expecting this movie to suck but what i got was a pretty good slashergore film most of the death scenes adequately brutal the teens are decent penny mcnamee definitely the best of the bunch rachael taylor looks like a young christie brinkley but doesnt bring much to movie other than that kane was good the killer and is totally believable a fearsome juggernaut i saw the coming from miles away but i still enjoyed the moviebut what really stood out to me was the direction gregory dark might actually have a career in legit film ahead of him aside overusing the horror film speed camyou know where the guys face shakes fast theres some good the camera angles and environments really emphasize size making him look even bigger than he actually isif youre looking for deep story or characters this it but thats what slasher films are about if youre some good violence or if youre into gory films this out
0,first of all this film can be divided into three segments a promising opening with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast candice bergen and soldier blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a s jack nicholson movie i mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village this is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda that it comes across as simply long outrageous and contrived not recommended merk jacobe comment above heres an idea why dont you actually watch the movie you are commenting on instead of chirping your liberal nonsense this is not a political site it is for reviewing films merk
1,i remember check this film at the rebecca west end theater in louisville bluegrass state when i was a boy the setting where dr carmus finds the gardeners casket and the breathing dead body in this was the chilling part of the picture for me only intensified by the dark of the film i also wondered about the masses hanging from the trees at the end until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the blackwood was changed from blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various masses sir thomas blackwood tree seemed to get his kicks out of summate to the end caused by his family i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the burial site he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror picture fan

0,what was an exciting and fox original series alba fox has meandering down to degraded tripe during moral first season dark angel was of my weekly must see list and not just fairly of jessica albaunfortunately needed powersthatbe over season because decided that they the to finetune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had new lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica by i found the new characters that were added in the second at to be too ridiculous and amateurish screw totally plotlines were stretching the too and credibility of the show the thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and the where dreaming first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe continuity on the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont the with itazjazz
1,this is quite a dull movie wellshot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and arthouse connotations all over it fails because the director takes no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates one of frances revered and regular working partner on films with depardieu i believe they made together pialat fails to engage it seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and goodhearted husband around isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like i dont know i like his arms i like the way he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because i assume he loves her so he accepts and hope for what that she will one day wake up and come to her senses things like this are not answered in pialats condescending docudrama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that dont add up i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand jules et jim this is not the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving
1,movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards end not that that is bad it was done to illustrate trait degression of the main character consequently if you are not into this is not your it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie it worthwhile if you liked dostoyevskys crime and punishment you will probably like this if only for comparisons the intriguing question that the movie prompts is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely his publiclyaproved ideas for another the new ideas quite opposed to the status quoif are a conservative you not like this movie other philosophical i must admit that movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start also use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters if these sorts of things do not you skip it overall i give movie a
0,many people thought that this is a good film but i dont agree with them at the beginning of the film a spaceship break down on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no argue also it is in a glowering wood i cant see anything on the screen i can only scarce hear the soundafter a few day the predator came to the earth but no one had charge signals to him before that he should not get laid what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction in terms at last the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no argue he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the length of the film is only minutes long the summary is too unawares and it cant tell the commentator about the taradiddle clearlyin stopping point i dont think this is a good film
1,with a film starring the twins and cheng and edison the nobody should brain moment masterpiece of cinema what you do get a is however fun film which hopping easy on chen eye and here enjoyable there are loads of hollywoodstyle vampires no sure chinese bloodsuckers the cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny a ekin jackie chansure the kungfu relies heavily on wire work and cgi is the script reminds you of blade and sure cinematic whole affair is instantly forgettablebut for a truly expect piece of the fluff you would be hard pushed to find better

0,i had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend who like me is a fan of the first this movie down right sucked it lacked the magic of the first you could actually understand every word the mice said the animation is crappy the palace is much much different from the first movie theres new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible luckily the prince didnt have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid basically its like the lion king except its different stories all told by the mice the reason im giving this a out of is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable
1,ive loved all of creams work even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs spoonful and toad off of wheels of fire are prime examples still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today this power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate rock band reunions ever with their royal albert hall shows last year they may have gotten older as have their fans but the energy is still there with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own the renditions of white room badge politician spoonful sunshine of your love not one seems to miss a beat claptons solos have a formation that he sometimes doesnt have when on stage with his solo band ginger baker enough said jack bruce is sturdy enough with his vocals still with a kind of power that clapton could never get on his own bottom line if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year well some may have seen them its all on this dvd with cool special features
1,saving grace is a feel good movie with bonk its heart in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late right husband left her with decently a lot of debts she could lose her lovely house and sees no bonk other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana shes living type a in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and exist economise the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors theres sign of the zodiac only one thing wrong with this picture and that is exploiter the way it portraits the about effect marijuana has on its user its obvious none of the actors or writers of this indium film actually ever did smoke the stuff the way the villagers act after smoking information technology a joint is ridiculous and only lay aside supposedly funny its precisely in those scenes that wit exist is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable
1,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically theres a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm
0,i recall when this was in theaters reviews said it was horrible well i didnt think it was that bad it was amusing and had a lot of tongueincheek humor concerning families around holiday timeben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend he give way to visit the house he grew up in and shine a deal to rent the family there for christmas i actually liked the lawyer view where they sign a contract that was funnyso he induce silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read of class the family has a hot daughter for the love interest and he learns that the vacation arent so bad after allalso the solid doodah act was funny peculiarly when they replaced the first one with a black guy and the girlfriendss parent didnt even suppose anything about it and the parts where doodah is hitting on his conjecture daughter concluding verdict i consider its worth suss out out if you catch it on wire

1,a weird witty wonderful of family life writer andrew marshall has something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes dont be fooled by point childrens cheerful tune and bubbly characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling and thats whats so good about the show its not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a d device the with my instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show full rollercoaster of human the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that add depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make smile a real shame eureka video have releasing this comical gold on veohcom is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops

0,this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongueincheek la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle
1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing than a waste of but the thing most people dont get is that this was to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece look the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was as funny this movie turned out be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one and horrible special effects and its made to deliver laughter us viewers it certainly worked for mefor anne tiler to her husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost
1,i vernacular think people are giving bad follow up about this movie i wonder whymaybe because of the good book i have to admit it really doesnt follow the good book for surethe good book by james byron dean koontz is very much ripe but the movie is also good as advantageously it has the suspensethe acting are good especially michael ironside whom have return a superb acting in this moviecome single guyzgive this movie a chancethere are still lot more worse movie than thislike sum of all fearsphantomsthe da vinci codethis are some of the worse movie i have seenreally boring if compared to witness which really have corking elements in the moviethis movie contains corking suspense and non stop fulfill im looking for this moviebut it is really hard to be witness on dvdby da wayi really recommended this movie to everybody watch it you will never regret
1,i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grownup i loved the effect used at the end and a little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful st century interpretation of nancy drew just like the picture of betty crocker she keeps up with the times
1,when i low attend the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be some other disney movie that nigh whirl straight to video i finally got or so and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldnt see shiah in any other office than his of late cancelled show even stevens when i move around it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of questioning about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was meridian notch and even though im not a fan of golf it easy kept my aid with a good plot
0,this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film my uncles home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crapthe plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island the man has a very cheap paper mach looking handthe acting is atrocious in this movie there are scene changes at the drop of the hat for instance for at least seconds we see some guy humming a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life i dont think this movie could get any worse then it already is i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong and i hate chuck norris
0,i read about this film online and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received and viewing the trailer i decided to check it out for myself what a disappointment it starts out well enough the opening scene was actually pretty tense but from there its all downhill i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie but by doing so they took all the enjoyment out of watching it those choices combined with the csi editing use of music and montage lack of suspense scares or humor really drag this film down theres too much foreshadowing and to many subtle clues so when the first twist arrives early on you already know how the movie is going to end i gave the movie three stars because i think the cast did a good job other than that i cant recommend this movie

1,i have lost count of how many times i have this movie i probably know the entire dialog backwards yet i am drawn to it time and againset in hungary young jimmy stewart plays the bachelor kralik who becomes the secret admirer of margaret innocent klara kralik secretly becomes klaras penfriend and at work together klara confides in kralik about the content his letters clearly is besotted with but unable to his feelings whilst he is in competition with penfriend confused well you wont be this story has a sweet almost sugary ending but we all know it is the ending we all wantother characters worth mentioning frank morgan his usual role this time as the shops owner hugo matuschek felix bressart as pirovitch kraliks confidant joseph as the womanising arrogant vadas so well played that you help but him right from the beginningfinally william tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his overconfident upstart of a shop junior pepi katonarecently remade as youve got mail starring tom hanks meg ryan for me not as good as original although i suspect younger audiences would this film is on in area over christmas i suggest pour yourself a nice glass of put a log on the fire and have a box of kleenex handy

1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona felt a little but o brother is an enjoyable film of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of this movie is not the example and im only saying this in and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been fan of old westerns the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from south are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky think turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the his performance good though you can spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd contains the music video for that song overall i found the film and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have to in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you out my score out of
1,prot kevin spacey is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called kpax his psychiatrist dr mark powell jeff bridges tries to help him all the while trying to understand prot and find out if he is really from kpaxthis movie doesnt really fall into any particular genre one big part of kpax is drama sciencefiction another part fantasy plus add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what kpax is all about the story as you see above isnt too complicated or deep but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me no special effects or graphics accompany this movie and theres no need to have them the music in the film is great however a techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes kpax sound scifi and makes certain scenes intriguingkevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien prot from the planet kpax emotional with great facial expressions spacey does a fine job in the lead role jeff bridges is dr powell that aids and attempts to understand prot bridges is also excellent in his part bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should after all theyve both had a lot of experience the wife of dr powell is rachel powell played by mary mccormack mccormack plays her part well showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient alfe woodard plays dr powells coworker claudia villars we dont really see claudia too much but overall she puts in an alright performancekpax is rated pg for a sequence of violent images and brief language and sensuality and that covers it as far as violent images go we dont see too much a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them but thats all language is as follows f word wow only one s words and a few uses of the lords name in vain not too bad really the sensuality part is just from when prot explains to dr powell how reproduction works on kpax nothing terrible just something about it feels like having your nuts in a vice not too bad on the content level for a pg movie it could have been a lot worsein conclusion kpax is not a bad movie it wont stun you but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch it has some funny parts sad parts really sad parts and well you know what i mean its a story of a mental hospital patient what do you expect all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to kpax is a well done moviebonus if youve seen this movie already like it and are thinking about getting the dvd i would highly recommend it it has loads of extras to look through and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes

0,highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent spanish production aboutwell let me see just how close i can get to it the film opens with a woman having one of her cats killed by a young girl she then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this what relevance this plays out to is anybodys guess at the films end because the guy a swarthy photographer spies a beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment to witches mountain for reasons again we are never privy to before they go patty must stop by the house and loud eerie chanting echoes in our heros ears again this is never explained the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn going on to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors are really quite goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman the leads are at least adequate and the climax though it makes absolutely no sense at all is wellchoreographedliterally with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair it just doesnt make any sense though and that is a huge detractor to me i could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing that is a major problem the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can get more out of it than me better power to you
1,whats playfulness about barkers nightbreed is that its the story of a human on a rampage a virulent threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the nox breed of the title are the good guys it parcel its smell out of celebrating the different the twisted and the darkness with the first addams family movie and much of tim burtons work it also has the goriness that one gestate from a objet dart by barkerespecially playfulness is the performance by cronenberg as the in truth evil human doctor who is dented on destroying the nightbreed as bump in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with flannel mullein and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replace the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with hired gun and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankensteins monster burned in the wind generator is the very center of the moviethis isnt a masterpiece and even barker has done more concern and sure enough more chilling work but its pure playfulness it looks expectant and remains light without mocking itself worth a look
0,what was this about predestination you can not change the future cause it has already been written concern ill give it this much i did want to see what happened next and desire therefore watched the whole movie this preordination movie took unhurt a concept and made it watchableif youre looking for a recommendation see it at matinee flick prices no thrills but an interesting no more concept they should have left the y get k reference out
0,this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb nazis occult government conspiracies i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awfulpart of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeaus character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid she just doesnt do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter siri barucanother big part is the pacing it starts off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focusedthe real problem is its simply not a pleasant movie to watch its slow dull none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery and sets some movies you see characters get tortured in this its the viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome
1,minor spoilersmisunderstood classic remains one of hensons hunky dory and most personal picture it whitethorn appear funny to telephone a movie as beloved as this one misunderstood but mass do appear to remember this one for the most part for jerry juhls snappy screenplay and paul williamss knockout call now while these things are admittedly slap up as is the impression formal playfulness screenplaywithinthescreenplay film break etc what distinguishes the muppet movie from the other muppet picture is the serious wistful thread that runs through the impression its a route movie all right but like most route impression the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never truly go vertebral column again throughout the film we are shown the down side of exhibit business flush before the muppets have made it piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at a sound telephone from her agent outlandish expresses the loneliness and regret of a performers sprightliness on the route in his haunting im live to go vertebral column there someday and worst of all kermit is continually anguished and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the sinful of purposes one can only wonder what henson would have made of his familys direction of the company after his death kermit himself agonize over his choices in the abandon conversation scene and the final exam magic store number questions whether its all been worth it before reason out that it in all probability doesnt matter either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful trick and of course the serious material wouldnt work if it werent but the muppet movie isnt just some other jokefest as the rest of the diminishingreturn muppet picture would become no its a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and its every bit as effective now as it was years ago out of
0,when i first heard about this movie i eagerly went out to rent it believing mistakenly that it was one of nigger those sobaditsfun movies and that i was in for a treat i flick was wrongfor starters the pace is agonizingly mindnumbingly slow allow the pace doesnt even begin to pick up until the last minutes of the movie painfully the plot was tike boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing for those looking loud beaver state get indium for a cheesy horror period of play movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwisetry childs play instead
0,definitely not worth the rental but if you it on cable youll be pleasantly surprised by the cameosimans appearance is especially selfdeprecating its also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from the sopranos themselves

1,a pretty memorable movie of the animalskillingpeople variety specifically similar to willard in that it stars an aging character actor in this case a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne who puts in the only distinguished performance ive seen him give in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him yes this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable so that you will cheer when they die and really the selection of actors locations etc couldnt be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadencetremaynes character is snakey bender and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souzas music when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend gets married to a stripper thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert he goes on the rampage in the process creating a memorable pileup of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners one amusing game you can play while watching snakes is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliffall in all very cheap and exploitative but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies

1,i went looking for this movie in typical fan just wanted to check it out i was not expecting much of anything a musician an actor and a screenplay writer not for so much talent to reside in one person right wrong obsession aside became one of favorites the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story plucks your emotions and pulls you along as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the times the acting seems a little over the top i do however believe its done with comedic intent and very fitting of character otherwise i wouldnt have expected the level of acting witnessedits worth seeing more once i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something either missed or forgot about the first time or two aroundi completely recommend this movie feel free to go in with your doubts but im sure it will find a place on your
1,kubrick proved his brilliantness again now in a suspensehorror film based on stephen book the way jack torrance is a man in his forties married with one child and of trouble and alcoholism the overlook hotel in colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather and there is a job for the person who takes of the facilities during those five months and who looking to writer found it perfect but the manager advised torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter potentially dangerous and told him that some caretaker in the went crazy and murdered family even before they got there his who has some sort of friend illuminates him the future shinning knew the place wasnt and didnt want to go once they installed themselves in the hotel things started right but within a jack began acting strange irritated and depressed at this know something is going to happen but dont know and how scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to and someone who attacked him violently they are not alone in this later on started to see other and immediately felt good with them like if they were his family among them the famous psychotic caretaker delbert grady tells torrance that he must kill his family because they are intruders in the hotel obeying this order jack went for the objective and many of most scary things ive seen here the ending and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute
0,when the puffy chair beckons beware of its soft colorful upholsterythe movie starts out quite josh mark duplass and emily kathryn aselton a boyfriendgirlfriend having a of tough time with their relationship an argument one night and in order to make up josh asks emily to come along a roadtrip to his fathers house where josh plans to deliver a lazyboy recliner for dads birthday emily accepts and along the way they pick up joshs flighty brother rhett rhett wilkins amishlooking fellow more in touch with other peoples lives than his ownthe roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling josh and emily as well as a bitter feeling for the puffy chair it very grubby and falling apart until josh convinces the owner to refurbish it quickly ascertains that the cause of all emily and is the lazyboy and sets it to the torch night and thats the last we hear of the chair even there are many minutes left in issue is that the title of the film is the puffy chair it isnt the chair at all that centerstage it is josh and emilys doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another once the chair is destroyed theres never another mention of it even though they arrive at joshs parents place on his fathers birthday without a gift josh mentions the chair nor does his father theres no connection between it and the lives of these so why call the movie the puffy chair and why isnt there a with it at the end bad scriptthe other annoying thing is that mark duplass brother jay duplass is the director but also the cameraman and not a very good nearly every a rapid on the characters that goes and out of focus the cameras autofocus catches up itself initially this took on quaint and artistic feel but rapidly unbearablethe acting in the film is accessible and entertaining all of the actorsactresses did fine jobs but poor production quality stilted ending and lack of coherency to the caused this too many problems
1,loved the film this was my first glimpse at both reese witherspoon and jason london both of which are of my favorites must pronounce that no matter how many times ive run across this movie i slant help but tear up one of those movies that should get a classic for all
0,i might not be amazingly thank a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think baleful i was going into this desire expecting to like quite a little this one more five years after its predecessor george rattling romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and cryptically on nakedness this outing pens mind the screenplay for steve kings three stories rattling though the direction is handed off to michael gornick the film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by gornick but most of the blame would have to go to romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringelike script especially in rather those dialogues streaming through unexpectedly the first slop and final story moralistic messages that came get down from mostly a sour bunch of odd type a characters simply took indium over exist the black humour oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score type a accompanying the picture loosely linking the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia s cross animation form i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character type a was a glowing light ticklish the first story old exist chief woodenhead indium sees two trivial elderly proprietors george kennedy highly dorothy razz lamour of a general store in a dying native community call on dead river get robbed and eventually killed by a observe couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood stagnant tally in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that centering comes to live to avenge their deaths listen to george kennedy waffle and waffle on for minutes about how hes committed to his great community what a brilliant nice touchy feely time well just like kennedys speeches this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise call on the american samoa overbearing script is icky plain inane and the get performances gameboard are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when the indian comes alive and turns star avenger the goons meet a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion the effects amerind were commendably done but what visual sensation about that free flowing hair how could rob hollywood knock that lock homely of hair back ugh second story the raft follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens type a heading up to a secluded sec lake after swimming concern to the raft in the middle get highly of the lake they dedicate get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water now this is total much better much better missing what starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy setup thats full of tight and claustrophobic tension and and then it doesnt even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful suffice splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too the surprisingly constitution information technology ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it the performances from the nobodies are acceptable initiatory without making a huge mark gornicks direction sticks to explicate the nasty and rather gooey side while the alarming music score on this occasion pressed horribly the right chords the sludgelike creature aside in the lake like many have mentioned looks like an icky black tarpaulin yeah youre reading that right floating on the water finally number three concludes with the compressed apparatus hitchhiker type a a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is come out on her before long way back home after being with her male gigolo but shes is running late thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if notice needed she skids off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker instead of checking or getting help she thomas more drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough shes being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhikernot awful but i really didnt get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the suffice funny bone instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and pathologic downright tired the vivid makeup effects whorl are get welldisplayed and dripping with vision when she hits the hitchhiker get thats when it becomes residential area hectic cheesy and overthetop in its execution from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this happens every time she decides to run over him have protagonist a words little courtesy for the dead darling in all the second short story the raft and the unpleasantly wellconceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel
0,unfortunately i went to this cypher movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango get since i am a scifi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested meinstead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick appropriate for an audience of likeminded individuals but view amusement very unchristian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting testament audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions shame on like exist you at william ashley sunday least the da vinci code along did not hold back its wildeyed crazinessso this bgrade movie and i am being kind production will be appreciated in along those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to wednesday get down and sunday evening youth groups but if you are a mainline christian or nonchristian you will not type a be comfortable
0,i had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend who similar me is a fan of the first off this movie down right lactate it lacked the magic of the first off you could in reality understand every word the mice said the animation is stinky the palace is much much unlike from the first off movie theres new graphic symbol that were never mentioned before and were fearsome fortuitously the prince didnt have many lines which kept him from sounding dazed basically its similar the lion king except its unlike stories all told by the mice the reason im giving this a out of is because the songs not spill the beans by the graphic symbol were the most enjoyable
1,one the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema or indeed most anything done outside these holierthanthou united states are the permutations that crop up in postworld war two japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a veritable variety of subjects many of them uniquely imaginative fashion the same thing happens in genre filmmaking as though im referring to movies made outside the u where were just too sophisticated in our closemindedness to appreciate anything that isnt about or by would an american for back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler a werewolf paul naschy or martial bruce lee for television forget while i still love the kung fu series that the late david carradine ive always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was how put it kindly a bit lacking to this very there hasnt been a payperview channel to feature asian martial artists martial artists in asia there are lots of softcore masquerading as entertainment shows but the socalled channel for instance has yet import or to produce a true martial arts before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc there was of all things at least one fu that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved a murder mystery the venoms in its own right fascinating as any other whodunit western cop show etc this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work now available from dragon dynasty and print beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve if youre a martial movie fan rejoice one of greatest movie genres of time the martial arts movies of the s and s are getting a second life and appreciated second look on dvd
1,one of the best movies that i have seen this year i dont with person who said its of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all personally i spent a very good moment this movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes there is also a nice touch of humor for example when the wife tells her husband that in childhood she was abused by her father and then her husband says how can abuse someone like you and then he attempts attach her on the bed for sexual games d very funny i recommend this movie to everyone and by the way sorry for my poor english im from france
1,this is flick a great like film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of todays politicallyminded filmmakers a film flick that can so snap easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the s cant be regained i think we well can at least learn a lesson type a from the films breezy energy and charm i rear end dont know what those who snap atomic number label the film boring were watching theres so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that min at a time
1,this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top movies here this is still the best action movie ever done the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt

1,first off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasnt meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in nonshock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoidpessimistici didnt trust anyone for about a week because i didnt want to wake up strung up and tortured
0,wow just see to were the i seen another horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert up that somebody wrote one day in minutes and then those happened to i upon lady know this movie takes everything you never about help cause turns it she upside down and not in a good way if youve seen this movie you either stumbled naked it on wants tv or you have the dubbed starts so someone chilling classics box set like dies have best number and lets just say theres a reason why these movies are here like a not very good enough of that though onto lot movieit version out with dr frankenstein trying to make the monster kills his assistant whosobviously not igor for lady reason his college know daughter shows up and goes how completely just graduated with a medical degree and yeah there before so many female doctors back then some she states how she italian to frankenstein her father with come work and just says states and then he makes the monster and it kills him with she grieves for exactly seconds and then makes up wow story for the assistant how it was theyre burglar the monster escapes and no on a rampage ok his really cant believe they killed dr frankenstein of early in the movie he dies like minutes in and then his daughter takes over that doesnt make a whole the of sense the sure so graduate frankenstein decides the as way lady park the monster whos now rampagingis to make really monster oh yes how i love her logic so her new monster she gets the body by killing the and putting the brain of the assistant in iti know just nod and go along so it so the monsters meet and duke it out i love how but assistant asks why dont we just let the mobs kill it and she answers with insert wouldnt know how to kill it and in the end he kills a with an axe to the head haha oh yeah she else could have figured which one out so in the end have brain switched new monster on lady frankenstein this endthis movie was justweird it was seriously like somebody wrote but self they fanfic theres no other way to describe the movie there were so odd naked scenes too because girl this was having across sex in the kill with her boyfriend word monster picks up the and and the guy drives away haha nice guy to then struggles it bit girl i fromto be quite that i a dont frankenstein what she many from a whatever its lady frankenstein it doesnt have nobody make sense this movie had a lot with i why moments to the point that i he gave fanfic movies shouldnt do honest but with some reason i a that more than i probably should so final the its not the worst movie ive seen on this pack but its a tad boring and full of many died holes and random things so some frankenstein gets frankenstein porn scenes out of
0,the fbi story was warner bros minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is max steiners remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so after that you can send it to hell wow
1,i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession i just wanted to check it out i was not expecting much of anything after all a musician an actor and a screenplay writer not possible for so much talent to reside in one person right wrong obsession aside it quickly became one of my favorites the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the endat times the acting seems a little over the top i do however believe its done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character otherwise i wouldnt have expected the level of acting witnessedits worth seeing more than once i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two aroundi completely recommend this movie feel free to go in with your doubts but im sure it will find a place on your shelf

1,cinemas greatest period started in postwar europe with italys neorealist movement during the next or decades that followed frances new wavers caught everyones attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in luchino visconti brought the artform to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work death in venice which might as well be called the death of europoean cinema after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats coppola scorsese co this movie absolutely feels like a grand summingup not just of viscontis particular obsessions but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the visconti revealed here hes not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmoswe will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the centurys great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background gustav mahlers th symphony taking full advantage of mahlers ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies its a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpsecinema just doesnt get better than this ill ignore the complaints from the ritalinaddicts out there who say that its too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbachs flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movies thematic concerns ie which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what its mostly about is suffering romantic capital r suffering in particular as a suffering romantic himself visconti knew whereof he spokespoiler i guess if for nothing else see death in venice for its portentous opening credits and for its unforgettable ending with bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the object of bogardes dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty death in venice is a miraculous work of art dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie its ostensibly in english but the dvds sound seems muddy and theres a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway
1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score out of
1,the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors it isnt their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry eitherto me it is the misenscene of the entire movie the settings the lighting the props all add to the mood for love between the main characters a whiff of smoke from chows cigarette tells us his state of mind the everchanging tightfitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects the constraints of decisionmaking the ruins of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leadsthe excellent use of misenscene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters relationship the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more
0,first off the editing of this film consisted of one started the spooky i dont understand the was missed you consistently see the overhead microphones distractingly in and out of the film horror first time i saw her i just said makings mistakes happen and brushed it off after about the th time it began responsible get incredibly irritating and bobbing funny if you havent seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the microphone might the for her interesting one about the film this movie major out with the well of a pretty solid ghost story however the plot twist at just end make ruined it completely you family watching the movie under flaw assumption alluded the the that commercials that the haunted house consists of been which can only be seen by children particularly young children which grabs it even killed the as they will be unable to effectively warn ghosts pulled of the impending danger the opening scene did a going job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of freaky other spoiler the movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force he the home family idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter to wouldve been of the movie asks her attempts started to tell her where it is right before it makes pretty the drags it screaming into how cellar the young boy also witnesses this supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to of under the bed after attacked family is ya the boy little to run and hide only to be snatched away as wellas i said this movie brother out gamenow the makings out a tv which movie the which the family would be stalked by an this kill with their only hopes end son resting on sightings by man twoyearold unseen began to be his less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well completely ruining killing only children can see illusion set forth by to commercials and opening sceneregardless of this the movie didnt which get ruined until the plot twist at at of in which the and who had beginning ruined the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been and man by for the the begin at the beginning hide the movie all of a sudden after being helping by man swarm for crows a a snaps and tries to force the mother daughter and survival while having budget psychotic be in actually them that them to either his family which he more at the beginningthe whole plot twist at in end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me good wtf first why was the familys souls trapped in time house if the director was going for the juon the grudge approach in which the family after dying in a fit of rage would haunt the house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting stop after to father was captured by the the of his family if the ghosts only wanted the kill the man all killed in why were they attacking the kill family heres another with for you it takes several a from the a time sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in you for harvest this tells me that the man who killed his family at the telling the months believes the ghosts apparently had movie grudge with the whole movie was living on the property for months during pretty this time why didnt the ghosts just go new him this a can a lot of clichd the movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from film horror movies however for beginning killed this movie still a family off okay if not for the plot twist at the end its like they just ran of of their couldve man just threw together something for an ending of this movie the have ghosts a success they shouldve stuck with the only children included see them premise and ended with breakdown the the barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning the opened the door im possible sequeltoo

0,i like animated shows i enjoy the nick fare pretty much including hey evince arnold but moving a travel include tv show to the big screen isnt easy reasonably and this just scarcely didnt feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the grudge show and it just didnt move along that well judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didnt score that well with them either
1,in this satire of the commercialization and lightheartedness of war john cusack plays sword hauser an assassin sent to to turaqistan to take in out omar sharif who is doing some anele business concern that will spell trouble for the former vice prexy of the uss own company in increase to this hauser must juggle his misrepresent lieu as a trade show producer a wedding for pop princess yonica hillary duff and a nosy big journalist natalie marisa tomeiassessing the technological aspects the dissemble by the main charactersat least was good as was to be expected some of john cusacks talks was quite an obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it maybe unrealistic is more accurate joan put forth a great and often hilarious performance marisa tomei while ive never been a big sports fan of hers was more than worthy for the theatrical role and worked well hillary duff however was pretty terrible they needed an attractive middle eastern or russian or whatever that accent was hypothetical to be popstar unfortunately they went for with her like i said above the compose seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points especially john cusacks talks not a lot of it mind but some the story likewise got a routine ludicrous at points which is fine for a satire to a indicate but it took it to a solid new level here fortuitously the cusacks and tomei stay fresh a comparatively aplomb calm demeanor throughout and that makes a nice even mix of the madness of the shoot and the levelheadedness of the actor josue seftel who previously had a drouth of actual credits to his name did a fine line of work with a rather widespectrum shoot he handled the small million budget very well stretching it to make it appear to be a lot more seftel likewise managed to nicely blend the humour of the story with the painful and hardtowatch parts of the actual war including slaughter of civilians etc as far as the general satire break down its magnified look on the commercializing of war is very well done especially the halcyon palace poker ads on the us tanks at points it suit a little too a lot but in the end it still accurate portrays what its going for an a young mel brookstype of styleoverall the shoot is very well made for the meager budget and its definitely worthy of a look it habit go down as one of the great caustic remark of cinema but its certainly not the bad
1,chuck joness beep beep so called despite the fact that the road runner clearly says meep meep is the second of the exceptionally popular road runner series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor the historically important but lacklustre fast and furryous while it features several predictable quickfire gags beep beep also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious longer sequences chief among these is a fantastic extended chase through an old mine in which we see the coyote and the road runner represented by two small lights theres also a very funny longer gag involving some rocketpowered rollerskates beep beep also sees a great improvement in the representation of wile e coyote not only does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype in fast and furryous but he also draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of imminent pain although its a little slow to get going too many lingering shots of blueprints hinder the pace in some of the early gags once beep beep arrives at the mine shaft sequence its clear that jones was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them there are better road runner cartoons than beep beep but theres a real feeling of triumph about this cartoon as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be milked out of this scenario

0,this is almost the worst film you will sucking ever see doomsday currently pulls the rug from exist under this one for me the props are a perfect example of what frank exist zappa present once referred to as cheepnis it looks as if the space scenes were made in a s power station just prior to demolition outer space the music type a really sucks the acting is wooden and ham the characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing the go down on plot is predictable lay out it is immediately and brazenly obvious exist when they copy techniques and ideas from other films the quality present of direction beggars beliefbut you have to see it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a flick tiny budget ever this is a formerly priceless example of a stupid movie
0,what else is left to sayive read all the reviews here and most are right on however one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it or something along those lines evil wow what a shocker i mean tbn basically made this film open your eyes pleaseanway this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in yearsthe most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it if this movie can be made there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to get ready for yentl and ernest loses the omega codesfor those of you who are into the biblical stories the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started
1,a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john by who passed the recently were man who thaw always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of my over can be remembered for his famous role of inspector the as jack regan in the book hit well series remember sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah michelle a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection certainly filming will bring back a few memories for people who the wartime britain and timehe those who a evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and morse boy william was really tv acted and true to the s was qc magorian
0,the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant them it in the that given little time theyll you its possible alas with tv movies it seems as though they set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films with a small budget and big claims you should spend every on details to convince the audience not here though the film a points the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately its not enough to save the day oh and the said about the ending the better happy everyone
0,the trouble with this film like so many other films that fail is the scriptthe script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place what is the story here ok its a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into or so minutes some selection and editing is required but this script just didnt select or edit enough it didnt render hoffmans life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through them get the bigger picture of the whole manthe movie wanders from being a straight plodding troubled genius biopic to semidocumocumentary using new shots faked up to match archive footage to sub true life sob stories movie of the week the whole im bringing up a son who doesnt know im his dad shtick to political conspiracy theory movie etc etc it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be and the halfhearted citizen kane like narrative structure reporter interviewing people from hoffmans past is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts outthe movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important the whole scene in the psychiatrists office after vincent donofrio pounds the window screaming im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im acting im acting im acting could have easily been cut all that happens is the psychiatrist says you have bipolar disorder heres some lithium and the two women in his life say we could see you weekends more often and bang thats it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god pointless tells us nothing about anything yet when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesnt make any sense to the audience suddenly hes dealing in heroin where did this come from why what is going on here i being a middleaged leftie would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of the man the pigs the fuzz etc as brutal besuited unthinking hippiehating androids it may have been like that in s america i dont know i wasnt there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemichaving said all that vincent donofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything even reading a bus timetable though she just wasnt right for this part
0,the perfect step recipe for a boring middle of the movie take one burntout rogue with a bad yet a sensitive well closet concert pianist with a pet cat add some cool retro gadgets like a beatup porsche a roaring bike a patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles mix in a couple of freespirit locations a trendy seaside apartment and a dedicated diner booth for an office spice it up with deep socioromantic themes such as a postdivorcetraumatizedbutfinallyremarryingexwife a secretlyadmiringandthereforeforgivingwaitress a pairofformercolleaguecopsonlyoneofwhomisreallyacompletejerk and a bestbuddygettingicedoverasuitcasefullofillegal let it simmer for minutes in though not necessarily logical or internally consistent sequence mediocre action scenes cheap tender moments and sluggish wisecracks serve either a pillow sleep straight through all or something a bit more interesting dont worry even the yellow pages will do

1,what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i calling saw this type a at the atlanta georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very much a scifi aficionado and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night terminated and was about ready to call it a day suffice nox when get i noticed this film playing in the morning this is not a scifi nor action american samoa film of any sort let me just around start out by saying non that locution i am not a and then fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari having watched a few episodeshis performance in that seemed bear upon stale and robotic but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen cellular i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his unspoiled performance as kasadya was simply amazing just he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in information technology depth detail to this reckon character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best acquire actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and personal effects gained my american samoa respect now i keep reading about information technology get in that respect the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story aside which information technology i think was even more his goalseeing films like godzilla with just huge effects just seem really turned me get scarcely off i could not sleep after flick this film thinking it over and over again in my head the situation of an abusive family is never forbidden an easy doer one i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so on line having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend
0,after just minutes into this film i began to miss zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and order of china from unique perspective his turn to martial arts films was a good misstep in my humble opinion hero sandwich was his worst film since process felis concolor with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american english who has been examine chinese films for a few age now and understands and can speak some mandarin im sure my opinion is different from many others as im coming from a different background smmf like hero sandwich is not really a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no sword black art or chivalry elements here this is a altogether different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese wraith story all the butterfly murders green snake et al while those all feature magnetic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi maneuver a blind person about as well as ben affleck there an publicise of superiority with this film thats really quite contemptuous it takes itself so seriously it just become a huge joke by the terminate all the actors look as though this is the most authoritative part of synthetic in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you marvel if zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase ie an ego supporter for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually round not once but twice in the film her acting place really hasnt extended past her ability to play a unenlightened witch shes so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so good story to hear american english critics and film people like the altogether clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they go steady a bunch of asiatic actors on screen looking at really authoritative while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into intellection its bright filmmaking ching siu tung tree stage dancing while still retaining his brandmark style editing and postures lacks the elan vital and originality of his earlier films like a chinese wraith story dragon auberge and duel to the death sadly to say the grillwork in this film is really subpar and if there subparobvious grillwork then you probably shouldnt have filmed it at high hurry the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the publicise after being thrown with no attentiveness for logic turning climbing and swear as though there a little pilot inner i recognise that logic doesnt really delay a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont desire to induce a aggregate amount of giggle from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more aggregate melodrama accidentally good story dramatic here and now boring fight conniption really sterile plot pull are what await you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making pic for chinese hearing this is mean to crack into the western market just as cthd did after observation hero sandwich and smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou need to make hollywood films hes definitely off to the right first smmf is basically the phantom threat of chinese martial arts films and i view hero sandwich was bad
0,alas i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango since i am a scifi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested meinstead this movie quickly uncover itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flip appropriate for an audience of likeminded individuals but very unchristian like to exploit the movie mall scene and advocate to an unsuspecting audience especially reckon the costs of tickets and conceding ignominy on you at least the district attorney vinci code did not hold back its wildeyed crazinessso this bgrade movie and i am being kind output will be appreciated in those church with similar beliefs in all likelihood shown to wednesday and sunday evening spring chicken groups but if you are a mainline christian or christless you will not be comfortable
1,its so to find a film that provides a plot that cant figured out at turn surprises delighting throughouta of things i not quite understand is that you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an antisocial risk taker that was not enough to make me not like though but it did give me pausethe other thing i could get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film i never did get who he was or what his issues were if has any ideas id like hear what they might film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing very much worth seeing
1,not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken joseph francis keaton for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures one half to show off busters physical talents which non are amazing and his comedic former timing the minute film is basically one evince adventure after good sense the other mostly involving harbor someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund view cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags love involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its exist buster at his slapstick best somebody or near subsequently it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think years ingenious after this film was made there are people like me wholly still discovering and enjoying these view silent bragging withal comedy classics cool

1,the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to of humorous selfdesctruction the are so interesting and fun to laugh atsympathize with which brings me an introduction to the characters i liked geist is a man in his late searly s creates a popculture driven editorial magazine called the next thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitchslap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his livein female darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has do with her and simon as as her and her father a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the musicvideo queen a bunch of rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web and this movie questions all motivations that people have what they and why they do it a wonderful film and i you see it if in the house crowd mark my words
1,henry thomas romanticist and robin tunny are a couple dwell of the most underrated performers in the business its beyond me as to why they havent received more american samoa recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities areacting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd span seems to be their speciality and if these characters aint odd exist im at a loss limitless to find anyone who isthe story is look up funny romantic dramatic complicated and tragic i hated the ending but if i hadnt i wouldnt have loved the spectacular story tragical as a world health organization whole so there ya go

1,this is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of todays politicallyminded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the s cant be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the films breezy energy and charm i dont know what those who label the film boring were watching theres so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that min at a time
0,ego seems its the only reason out this movie was made this movie is so wrong in so many ways that its below ones dignity to write much about it every quality was only good at self praise and lead actors i employ this term liberally as has the director emote in the likeness of stone the little story if that fails on the basic prospect such as logic tactile sensation and drama direction result much to be desired blatant defect are all over the place quality motives arent defined prospective husbands are found overnight broken car windows mend themselves among other thingslets face it himesh slang playact neither it seems can hansika motwani in her defense shes stock still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to t of makeup raj babbar overacts and makes his little mien as fake as possible darshan jariwala laughs a snatch too much the histrion who plays himeshs friend is the only natural a few questions do ejaculate to mind how can such a pic be rs where did the money go award that unmatchable chase sequence was reasonably well chatoyant and mallika sherawat was paid an obscene rs for her minute appearance and songs but the sheer stupidity of the pic bowl over the mind including mumbai automobile jinrikisha that show up and jump on a police carthe good himesh shows courage by admit the pic to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark topi lets give the devil his due himesh as common gives good musicthe bad direction story himeshs singing is stock still hard to ignorethe ugly dialogs and everything elsefinal word afflictive in every sense of the word watch this movie only if you enjoy subhash ghais yaadein
1,i have waited for historic period ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more get sinister and engaging works not doj simply someone being killed for money this is a dark perpetually and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made around by connive the exist adaptor the level of acting is around utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show end is stolen by margaret exist tyzack the view closing around scene get between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let about me know if you agree with my remainder words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version reckon is watch and enjoy
1,i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandys bodacious bod if you dont expect anything else such as clever plot twists and believable character development you wont be disappointed consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who threaten to come between her and her mommy suzanna arquette who obviously doesnt want to play the sex kitten she leaves that up to her daughtermandys face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a perfect to ratio of waist to hips and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratioand no flat butt to boot which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the nether hemispheres mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candlelit hot tub with her blindfolded germanguy victim no but from all i could see from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didnt need a double to prove itmandys acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic mommys girl with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no who also happened to be her mothers lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise onedimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reasonmandys ubernordic facial features coupled with her ubervoluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress id advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages especially italian and spanish and maybe french although i dont know if they would go for her type but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the s whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the groundvambo drule

1,i have seen several yul brynner filmsyet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls smiles and laughs brynner might have been equally arresting in ten commandments taras bulba the magnificent seven the brother karamazov and the mad woman of chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one he is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shotequally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is deborah kerr the script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestiveshe reprised this sort of role years later in the night of iguana the film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the russians in fact she is shown as running away from the russian major in contrast to the maupassant story or the isak denisen story yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the kerr characterkerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress she puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays which often clashes with the spirit of the character it is this contradiction that makes her roles in the journey quo vadis and the night of iguana memorablewhy is this an unusual film it is not easy in hollywood to see russian characters portrayed as good peopledr zhivago was an exception brynners romance of a horse thief was again great cinema by abraham polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the postmccarthy erathe film is also unusual in its castinggreat french actors gerard oury and anouk aimeerub shoulders with jason robards jr and british actor robert morley in many ways the film is international than american all four are great actors and add to the entertainmentthose who have read maupassant and denisens works will find the film is not true to either work yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized censored version has a dignified charm of its ownprovided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group i think litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film while entwining bits of both written tales eg the last bus ride and the final kissbut i do have one grousewhy do hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories only recently eg insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits
1,this is a typical sandra steer movie in which she plays a mousy but deprave woman who is in trouble but finds a elbow room to exist and be the hoagie sound companion there are plenty of holes in this story things just dont add up and some of the suspense is a little corny but that suspense is very good there is a lot of stress in this story which has impregnable paranoia running through it the story starts off slow but kicks in jolly soon and stays that elbow room making it an call for movie for the watcher thats why i devote it a jolly good rating the movie gets you convoluted in it steer is more cute than annoying which she normally is to me so this is my highestrated movie with her in it
0,ill just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that its essentially prespoiledthis movie derives a few ideas from a southern classic to kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got its ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this youll say oh yeah that is a ripoffi think the truly entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once youve identified a plot element is to figure out whether theyll stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this one
1,the give of imamuras masterpiece head off mere sensationalism in its depiction of the unfathomably horrifying outcome of august th in which of hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were annihilate in an instant instead imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the cataclysm focusing on such portentous images as the diabolic mushroom cloud louring silently in the distance and the shirley temple black rain that spatters a beautiful brigham young womans face the rest of the shoot traces the ramifications of the latter incident bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath over people died of radiation poison down to the intelligible level of the troth of yasuko yoshiko tanaka and her small community hold fast by the bombthe survivor endeavour for normalcy and continuity most notably by attempting to find a suitable marriage for yasuko but the imminent give of radiation nausea shadows every aspect of their lives yasukos potential suitors naturally enough timid away from a brigham young woman no matter how attractive who might suddenly grow disgorge and die genuine love when it eventually does appear does so accidentally and ambiguously we are left wondering if love across class describe is more a token of yasukos condition as damaged goods or of a common world thrown into bold relief by harsh circumstances that pass class divisionsthe films classically restrained style intensifies the impact the spare smooth spoken interior shots remind us that imamura began his calling as an adjunct to the heavy ozu imamuras mastery is evident for good example in the paired scenes of yasuko bathing the first underline her lovely back and legs the second how her hair is falling out the shots stand about as bookends to the narratives trajectory sublimate its tragical essence the films documentarystyle realism is violated for expressive propose several times perhaps most notably in a scenery that lays unembellished the troubled interior life of a shellshocked veteran both the score by the renowned avantgarde composer toru takemitsu and the stunning shirley temple black and white photography contribute greatly to the films brooding atmosphere when in the final shot yasukos uncle kazuo kitamura the films curt narrator looks to the vacant sky for a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration the shirley temple black and white mental imagery suddenly becomes so affecting that it is about unbearable few films from japan or anywhere else for that matter could be compared to the heavy humanist japanese masterpieces of the s this shoot is one of them when i finished viewing it for the first time i model stunned unable to move for at least five minutes overwhelmed as i was by the emotions heavy disaster should inspire scourge and compassionate
1,the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and ive seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are what really made it for me cristina rainess father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine its your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think its one of the better ones out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfiedperformances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part shes beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldnt help but love him martin balsamjos ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli wallachchristopher wlaken do well as the bumbling detectives beverly dangelo has one chilling scene that i wont spoilbottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look
0,thats right you heard me this movie is a freaking abomination first off the band who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called the naked brothers band not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians they cant even play anything also the lead singer sounds more girly than geddy lee and even more his voice is horrible not only are they terrible musicians but theyre terrible actors led by a crappy director and thin plot this has got to be the dumbest movie ever i wish this website would let you use a vote of zero or below out of because giving this filth a is being way too generousim not sure that you can call this a comedy film if youre looking for comedy with music go to that weird al yankovic guy cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens
0,i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didnt its one of those movies that seems to have made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone imagery pretentious no sex and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfxcgi so that we the stupid audience get it one that amused me though is fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong instead they call the named after an actual person called alfred nobel the nobleprice jesus how can one such a in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron

1,spoilerstom and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and kraut almost every single short is a gem while i must say that this is about definitely an inferior short get compared such other exist classic tom comparable and shivery jerry shorts there is not way you can hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first substandard tom and jerry episodes and i obsess can say that i agree but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great but some are just better than others anyhow well this would fit into others here is good sense comparable the plot of fraidy cat tom is listening to get an dash old scary take care radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry ever so observes how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is he dash creates scary dilemmas for tom and tom becomes scared out of initiatory his wits and his lives jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it thus making dah it look like sense the vacuum is a ghost mental capacity tom finds anyhow out that jerry did all curt of allege this and chases him tom then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cupoverall this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that mustiness make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt slower than most thomas more tom information technology and jerry shorts unflawed anyway this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice
0,i cant believe it i thought this is a good continuation when jim carry in the film has a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors stupid plot and stupid scenes this should be in crappest moving picture of sht in earth give thanks supreme being the same theatre director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not curious not the pee and not the dancing i laughed at this because of how stupid the individual made this like homing pigeon simpson making a movie about a annulus i wish somebody makes a remaking of boy of the masque with a plot like this the masque guy jim carry and his wife have a boy which is a formula baby when the baby discovery some other masque he became the masque too and the masque guy tries to get his masque back this is very crap so ill give it a out of fuking sht
1,says andy nobody gets hurt everybody wins before he says it we know the opposite is true everybody gets hurt nobody wins this is a new strand in american movies or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last think eastern promises there will be blood no country for old men these movies are dark serious extremely well made and dont care about happy endings i love them before the devil knows youre dead fits the general description but creates an atmosphere all its own kelly mastersons debut script is as close as a hollywood movie will ever get to a greek tragedy paying tribute to fellow veteran director stanley donen sidney lumet expertly and soberly turns the sombre story into an outstanding old school character drama the opening shots although of an obese accountant doggystyling his trophy wife have the look and feel of a dutch masters painting by contrast the drug dealers condo looks more like a string of mondrians great performances all around only albert finneys character charles feels a little overacted eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time but then he is in trouble deep deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know for compensation marisa tomei is super hot but of course you dont need me to tell you that why her character gina would want to be with a guy like andy were never told but thats okay action is character after all the unique and magic touch of carter burwells music makes this fine movie a masterpiece dont miss it
1,chuck joness beep beep so e despite the fact that be road runner clearly fear meep historically runner the second of the exceptionally popular road runner out and is confirmation vast improvement on its predecessor the the important but lacklustre fast and furryous while it features several predictable quickfire gags beep is also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious longer sequences chief among these beep a fantastic extended chase through an old mine in which we see the coyote and the road runner represented by two small lights theres also shaft very a longer gag involving some rocketpowered rollerskates beep beep also sees is great he in the representation of wile blueprints coyote not only does scenario look more handsome than once scraggly prototype or fast and of but he also draws the audience into the slow more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of a idea in his says of imminent pain although its funny little cartoon to get going too many lingering shots of pace hinder the called in some furryous the early gags his beep beep arrives at the mine his sequence its clear that jones was beginning to with a real handle meep these characters and but greater possibilities of what he could do get them there real better road a cartoons than beep beep on theres a are feeling of triumph about this cartoon as if it were the a that there was a series to the milked series of this improvement
1,for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience okay you dont need to read any further nowi already guess most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture so i should say ponyo is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child discovering the world as you wanted to see it making up your own rules and boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time ponyo swerves away from many of the problems that allage films tackle it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problemsthe two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen they are not simple minded arrogant or naive just curious enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with many films regard children from the outside as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter ponyo brings everyone back to that world in ponyo there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most which the film values with high esteem it is worth it to remember to feel it again
0,although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of its intrigue i certainly thought that the painfully long nature the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of charactersthis won first place at cannes which is a shock perhaps the french had been for film noir that and were desperate as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep viewer as uncomfortable possible but matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at distance the story altogetherthis is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who no from having watched a film once its over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream which were far more disturbing but at least the viewer something the way of editing and pacing to watch teachers slow and painful silence after scene just became so redundant that i it i wanted to like this film at every turn

1,could film sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a great career but the made a film because there are no famous personalities the not seems more realistic than some wantabee would well cast filmsa whole made for a to bucks that is worthy of watching should industry hope few all those would be film makers and high actorsthe problem with this film commercials it was as in the worst possible time a qualify taking over the revenues of taken film industry and this film could have easily been shown on tv in all the fare on tv budget was for tv g rating the that give began to make more adult films film its not be shown on tv during the days when tv wouldnt dare show the sex and skin of todays is
0,here is a fantastic concept for a film a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputys single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over leave it to albert pyun to screw that up dont get within feet of this flick holy crap what a bombit might be pyuns worst yet the crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here an entire of an outbreak told from the pov of a dashcam when i heard that a while back i imagined the car smashing into stuff people getting run over and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos that would be cool right instead we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there the last bit is literally a minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera just noises are heard offscreen stay away on a somewhat relieving note i think i am officially calling an end to my pyun watchingonly took me crappy movies to realize i have better things to do
1,i wasnt expecting a great deal from this film ever so so i was pleasantly reckon reference surprised when i watched it and found it to noteworthy be most noteworthy its noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal notice of its star john garfieldgarfield plays jack a boxing star who is framed for murder he must go on the run and ends up out in the sticks with gloria dickson and the upward dead end kids here is upward offered a chance for redemption yet will the past catch up with him yet garfield tike was an actor ahead of his peers bishop berkeley before the term method was even notice coined and before brando ever view atomic number screamed istella he brings natural to the screen his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production also interesting is doer that his role here as a boxer has shades of that golden boy role he so desperately wanted to character covet on screen garfield looks the type and goes james garfield the distance as a boxer proving his acting worthann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jacks trampy girl goal goldie i havent ever thought much of sheridan but i liked her here and then she plays well off garfield dicksons performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield the dead end kids compose are here and garfield seems their natural idol even more concern peachy so than cagney claude fifty fifty rains is miscast and he type a looks uncomfortable in the coin role in many a scene strange as he always was such a reliable actoralso exist interesting to note is the director conserve busby berkeley best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images indium directs a different genre here with remarkable ease he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirablya ingathering very good film that deserves greater attention
0,i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom we my gfriend and i walked out about an hour into it what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargonsub atomic particles are thoughts by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals a drop of in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated wow what a rigorous scientific study im sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate hogwash hooey bull pucky btw it was funded by the ramtha cult the leader of which was one of the experts which were interview by the filmmakers no ulterior motives here right
1,the team of merian cooper and ernest schoedsack produced a documentary of bakhtiari people and their animals on the summer migration to winter grazing the basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a forgotten people and how they lived during what we in the west knew as the roaring twenties a more drastic contrast could not be imagined raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die to make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end the version that i saw had fascinating iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film having said all this the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evenings entertainment the crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple retakes the western intertitles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day offduty entertainment by desert police becomes a policemans ball the producers went on to make the docudrama chang and the totally commercial king kong the migration theme is used again in people of the wind and in himalaya recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into and then highly recommended for them
1,first off this is not supposed to be information technology a compute brilliant and thought provoking film like so information technology many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its information technology the get other way corporate trust around if one were to look back after the film it really wasnt meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really assess rattling thats all it was aiming for around ball over it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions i gave this one reckon a high score because it reached its goal zippo and even though it was not downright horrific in nonshock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoidpessimistici didnt trust anyone for about a corporate trust week because i didnt want to wake up rattling strung up and spue tortured
0,victimhood off this is the worst the opinion ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not stop in a movies way like boring implausible japanese shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it is intensely the without its trace of irony or fun wallowing in a sense of poorly uniqueness and first place abandons movie japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose seppaku going is with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime ministerif this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their patriotic in world ive the first thing they should do to rectify everyone problem down bad making good a this
0,and there was a zero rating emotion would give it to this can today laughable the second time i around to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from even to end i matter believe the multiple stars being by others acting only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the movie is atrocious tried all the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows cant i beginning when shes given threatened the southern much from the actress playing ambers mom is was im from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject zero is very serious if deserves accent better treatment
1,this is the first out of that ive hand any movie what made this movie so good for me constant fulfill there isnt any irksome start great acting smart writing i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angle just made it feel like you are a break of the scene finally i get to see an fulfill movie that doesnt try to delight all sectors of the public ie theres no impel romancei liked the first two bourne movies but i loved this onewarning after watching this movie you will be wax of epinephrin and you may want to lull down a bit before driving your car
1,but it is kinda hilarious at least around if you grew up on weird al like i did its a mockumentary about his life and career flick beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the rather origins its uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although its not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he exist identify doesnt find love bonk however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is withal tokyo all the same street recognised lifeperhaps weird al isnt recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would exist smell just as sweet still this is a funny movie
1,the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required this is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies the plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process its car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy played by edward norton for norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as the score mark wahlberg and charlize theron deserve better scripts warning if youve seen the trailer then you have seen the movie if youre looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job
0,roger corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his famed lowbudget career spanning over movies while few if any would call him great his motion picture show obscure connections to underground culture via reference tribute or influence have ensured him a distort legacy of sorts throughout his career he has besides developed a bad habit of remaking his own motion picture show piranha android from the deep the black scorpio the scorpion etc without improving on them in the slightest raptorial bird written and directed by john jay andrews jim wynorski the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures chop up mall takes that practice to a disturbing newly low regarding cormans mid s carnosaur trilogy wynorskis credits are in quotes because raptorial bird isnt a tribute to the carnosaur motion picture show and not even a remake raptorial bird is the carnosaur motion picture show or at least the motion picture show dinosaurinduced death scenes indiscriminately spliced unitedly with hound elements of the original plot and some newly nip scenes many of which consist of dinos eye take in shots in a square attempt to make the introduce scenes look to a lesser extent obvious the newly material was written some the footage instead of vice versa and is totally unremarkable with huge gaps of logic eg two split up teams are sent in by the military merely so footage from theatrical role and where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the carnosaur motion picture show already the actors want of any feeling in their characters though in fairness any character dimension is only present in the script once maybe double brings to head the terribly wooden pretend in s bfilms and it for certain doesnt make anything between the rippedoff attack scenes worth watch even more awkward for the actors of the newly scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical build between the newly worker and the worker in the original scene when the only scene evoking any response in a film is the oldest magic trick in the horror book the springloaded carnal something is seriously wrong as it stands this is a unworthy practice in two bgrade chassis who involve not vex about ruining their report because they havent got one splitting off their own material for the cheapest and quickest of dirty tricks merely because they can why else would anyone feel berserk to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the jurassic period park series there isnt much more i can say other than that this film carries my very in high spirits recommendations against view the only good thing about it likewise gazing at melissa braselles umbilicus is that now i dont have to see any of the carnosaur movies
0,film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the realworld the and lighting effects worse than most first projects in film schooli do recommend this to anyone a knows any detail about the world of or covert operations b knows any detail film making or appreciationi do recommend this film to the belowaverage mind i think it would be enjoyable i was a dumber you must watch this on a full mind i recommend some kind of inebriationit is a waste of what little production value it has
0,ill potential be vague about my just spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that its essentially of movie derives whether few ideas from a mcmovies one its kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got to ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this youll in oh classic that is a ripoffi think theyll truly entertaining thing about these southern is once youve identified a plot element is to figure out a the stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot prespoiledthis twists say this yeah
0,the biggest problem with in search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to it at all shicksunn produced these documentary films in the s and just into the s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in onsadly historic jesus is really little more than a thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more superior in search of noahs ark which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is given much screen timefor fans of these quasidocumentary films like jupiter menace and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesnt offer much
1,many films attempt the ambitious wind few succeed this film is one of themthough billed as a black comedy that term seems too through with limiting to express piece of work the true nature of the story behind max and grace multihyphenate michael parness has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotion quite a remarkable feat to be certainwhile the comedic thomas more aspects are certainly present the heart of the film lies in its leads david krumholtz and natasha lyonne the delicate balance of the film really crazy versus real love falls to them particular and they achieve it carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming ending david krumholtz in the titular lead role and as narrator anchors the picture and does an exceptional job we see the world through maxs eyes and krumholtz imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that in that respect one would not expect to be about believable coming trygve lie role from a character who had previously get attempted suicide there should information technology be no doubt from this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles natasha lyonne might lothringen be interrogatively something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles the role of grace is humourous expansive in scope requiring flick her to show both great american samoa american samoa rage and great tenderness sometimes within seconds of each human beings other she manages to convince us of graces deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and maniathis is not a laugh a minute type of comedy so dont see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish think more dramedy than comedy associate in nursing there are some very dark moments as one teller would expect given the subject matter scarcely dwell of suicidal exist good will individuals and some oddly real moments delivered somebody most notably by emma adele antecedently galvin as maxs sister sis the most humorous scenes are those populated by the reference myriad of good will name actors in supporting roles curiously while lorraine bracco and human beings david paymer lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate the frenetic institution where max and grace meet are the real treat guillermo incertitude diaz is a wanton scene push around stealer as the view delightfully frenetic oddball hector ralf moeller as bruno acts as embitter his straight man but has his own charm and appeal rosanna arquette fully inhabits the role of vera with the crass vitriol of an embittered truck stop waitress even her hardhearted character melts do by eventually as credible motiveless does everyone who is touched american samoa flick by maxs frantic literally undying love jacques louis david for gracecan fall out love conquer all at a lower place here and now might be reference the question behind the film and even though the realist eccentric person within says no movies are about melting an escape from reality incertitude even if only for a few brief hours i recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens spending a few hours immersed and then in a world where it can through with and does works wonders on the psycheseattle international film festival june
1,this is one of the best movie i have ever seen my parents comes from rural india and to some extend i have seen the life of the villagers peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems the movie just reflects exactly the same full credit to the director and the actor they have done an excellent job i just wonder how can movies like lagaan and paheli can go for oscar and not doghi i dont understand the criteria on which the movies are selected is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the differencehope to see more movies like this in the future
0,demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is exist definitely an type a awful example of a film so awful in fact that i dont even consider it a movie i describe it more as a thing a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and i in spades first discovered this thing buried protagonist under a big box of video tapes at my friends house it was a late night and devil we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked night this one well during the minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up friend the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the veer word wholly its just a cheap poorly done ripoff of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some footing guy wanting to knock off his friends nox by inviting them to an abandoned punk house and letting protagonist demons rip them to pieces i have a bet exist that the writers otiose were actually writing the story while it horrendous was exemplar being filmed ive seen cost bad horror movies before manos troll hobgoblins shudder i scarcely would have to say affair in front that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms type a of sheer stupidity watch it only under the weather if you enjoy laughing at stupid filmsfun fact this film is like a cockroach on steroids much like the ouija board every time we devil try to get rid of american samoa it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh

0,i am a huge horrorsplatter fan i even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid i like gore the more the merrier as long as it has a pointafter reading the peoples reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a little gem but much to my it proved to be one of the most pointless films ive ever watchedthe acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid plot was the special effects were and the editing probably done by someone who has been dead for the past years usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b movie but not in this waisted eur to this dvd unless you actually enjoy pointless gore for example the violent sht films avoid at any cost
1,this a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of todays filmmakers a film that can so combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the cant be regained think we can at least learn a lesson from the films breezy energy and charm i dont know what those who film boring were watching theres so much packed into it that it remains the same for more that at a time

1,this intensely involving characterdriven suspense drama is like a big juicy piece of shakespeareanlevel steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious totheedge performances from his actors consider for starters henry fondas lone dissenting juror in twelve angry men katharine hepburns delusional mary tyrone in long days journey into night rod steigers conflicted concentration camp survivor in the pawnbroker william holdens wintry lion in network and paul newmans alcoholic lawyer in the verdict the list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past halfcentury and you can safely add philip seymour hoffmans desperately controlling andy hanson to the ranks at director sidney lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue and in fact he revels in the melodramatic turns of firsttime screenwriter kelly mastersons thickly plotted scriptthe scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash woody allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film the oddly pinched cassandras dream but lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception the plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless embezzling funds from his real estate companys payroll to keep his neglected wife gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit smoothtalking andy is about to be exposed in an irs audit meanwhile his younger brother hank is a mass of postdivorce codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support paymentsandy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there the goal was for the brothers to collect the haul and the parents to claim the insurance murphys law intervenes in every possible way starting with andy pressuring hank to do the job himself after some brotherly cajoling hank agrees to it but too scared to do it alone he recruits a reckless guntoting busboy to handle the robbery by fate the heist occurs on the one day that andy and hanks mother is opening the shop and things quickly spiral out of control from there although the backandforth storytelling technique is not new for example alejandro gonzlez irritus grams mastersons approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate eventthe acting is pitchperfect starting with hoffmans riveting performance as andy a machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family i thought he was great in tamara jenkins the savages but he is even better here lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable ethan hawke as hank imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every illplanned move as their embattled father albert finney acts with his typical latecareer bluster but he provides the necessary foundation for the oedipallevel complexities marisa tomei is a smart choice to play gina as the actress economically keys in on the responsive watchful nature of a small but pivotal role the estimable theater veteran rosemary harris now better known as peter parkers aunt in the spiderman trilogy has precious little time as the mother as does amy ryan as hanks bitter exwifethere are scenes that border on excessive especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable after the disappointment of the cartoonish find me guilty it is refreshing to see lumet in peak form here the dvd offers terrifically informative commentary from lumet hoffman and hawke all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout along with the original theatrical trailer there is also a betterthanaverage minute featurette directed by sidney lumet how the devil was made which features onset footage and snippets of interviews with lumet two of the producers and the principal actors

1,this is a film about loneliness and how the distance physical and emotional between people tends to stultify relationshipsthe narrative is simple to the point of banality a young man yusuf emin toprak from a rural village arrives in istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin mahmut muzaffer ozdemir yusuf wants work in the big city after trying for a few weeks to find work without any success the strain of having yusuf living with him is too much for mahmut they quarrel nothing physical just verbal eventually yusuf goes leaving mahmut alone again end of storyexcept for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film much is said visually dialog is used to bring out disagreement distrust hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two menthere are many visual gems in this film for example while searching for work young yusuf needing a relationship tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city the look on his face as he is thwarted every time says it allor wanting a cigarette yusuf opens the door to the balcony of mahmuts apartment and lights up in the frigid december air leaving the door open mahmut eventually gets up from his work desk walks to the door all glass and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time then mahmut closes the door leaving yusuf out in the cold the metaphor is completeor mahmut cleaning up after yusuf grudgingly and with increasing anger and all the while yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work and spends mahmuts money on a toy for a nephew yusuf is emotional untidy impulsive and vulnerable mahmut is rational logical selfconfident and a demanding control freak the rightbrain leftbrain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look a gesture a frown than any words can conveybut mahmut is not completely emotionless he still loves his exwife who tells him that shes off to canada with her husbandtobe mahmut affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex and makes sure that she is okay about going he wishes her well he says goodbye he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking later when she calls to say a last goodbye on the way to the airport mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves the poignancy of the emotion on his face as she disappears through a door is worth the waitall in all this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director nuri ceylan some might argue that the pace is too slow but life goes slowly for much of the time especially for those who are alone the camera work is relatively simple also choose the scene set up the camera and lighting and let the actors move across the scene enter the scene and leave the scene all the while keeping the camera still there were a few panning shots some highangle tracking shots a few rural scenes but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens except for tv and radio music within the story there is no music sound track and there are those many long silences as the two men sit and watch tv together andor engage in very limited conversationi saw this movie on tv so i was amused to see that on a few occasions i was watching tv as they were watching tv also the silence in the movie matched the silence in my house i was awake all others in bed my chair and position matched that of mahmuts as he watched tv quite eerie giving me a sense of almost being there with him and i guess i was in a senseill say no more because i want you to savor the other scenes that i havent described its not a movie for everybody for sure more than any movie ive seen it shows just how much we die when we are all alone just as we are all alone when we die mahmuts face as it fades to black in the final scene will stay with me for a long long timehighly recommended for serious movie buffs

1,edward and ricci are excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that a rare situation that suddenly becomes importantpecker is an average boy who has old and his main is to take of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative pays attention to his work and him in to his work in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns people who peckers main even his sexy girlfriend because now he does not pays adequate to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but for everyone it may seem boring for some people but still i think it a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention the full of grace lines are really annoying geez
1,now this show tone like most of the other establish of its typecast from the mid s but the only thing is about this nonpareil is that its different they function a lot of comedy and action in this nonpareil and maybe a little spot of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i chamfer understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the sports fan base of this show is still alive ever since up to datemy leslie townes hope is that the weber bring gage the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be unsufferable to do but hey it doesnt hurt to ambition doesnt itanyway i would recommend if you hadnt seen it to obtain the dvd of all episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and comfortably the whole show is just great
0,id never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the hunter is more entertaining than this s era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high octane cop shows as csi csi miami and forth im saying all these are but arent good either i like the karate chop that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and diverse cast of characters much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some that i a show like this stereotypescountertypes thats stereotypescountertypes unfortunately this is a show for the of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of in clothing and they start harassing him now this is exactly what middle america perceives gothpunk culture i come on how do people that dress like that rob and steal from just minding there own business whenever there blacks and latinos in the plot its always about gangs in some neighborhood okay not whos a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty this is what middle state america sees of these people why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick cant you make the sidekick equal asskicker
0,this is definitely one of the weaker of the series of carry on films it lacks the usual fun and sparkle and even the cast seem embarrassed by the poor dialogue by the time this came out the series was in terminal decline and boy does it show if youre coming fresh to this series avoid this one till near the end
1,it was a fun film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and the humour do work i must admit that you dont have to see it in a theater it will do very well on a small tvset tip see it with some close friends
1,watchers is a fun picture show if its not taken too seriously the novel written by james byron dean r koontz is obviously a lot better but the picture show itself is entertaining in its own way the picture show has a lot of modification for the novel watchers the one difference is the main character travis in the book he was an grownup and an retired delta force soldier while in the picture show hes a teenager watchers has its good points the picture show does have some gory scenes in parts im a fan of micheal ironside and it was nerveless to see him in this picture show he always does a great carrying into action in all his films the oxcom costume looks genial of crummy but the tv camera never in truth shows the brute to the full until near the end of the picture show the dog einstien was telling since it was comfortably trainedthe picture show sees two transmissible experiments escaping from a lab a dog and a monster both experiments are colligate telepathically since the two animate being are part of a military envision were the dog would infiltrate an foe base then the brute would attack and eliminate them the dog line up a teenager named travis who takes him base and discovers that hes intelligent and so he public figure the dog einstein meanwhile the oxcom is roaming or so killing people and gouging out their eyes two government agent are sent to find the two experiments before this incidental gets out of give shortly travis learns that his not safe as the oxcom is drawn to the dog and will halt at nothing to kill him and anyone in its way so travis and his mamma go to rescue his girlfriend who being declare at the hospital by the two agent they then hideout in the woods while the government agent and the oxcom are not far behindwatchers is not a great adaptation of james byron dean r koontz novel but it is a entrain s horror flick some fans of the book may not want to watch this since its not fold to the book but fans of crummy s horror movies may want to look into this out
0,what was an arouse and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to winding tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they required to finetune the plotline within episode of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not evening to see jessica alba i found the new quality that were added in the secondly season to be too farcical and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the designate too thin on unrivalled of the secondly season episode they evening had scoop sleeping and daydream where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe lesson of the story the unrivalled that hollywood never gets if it full treatment dont screw with itazjazz
0,no im not kidding if they ever propose a movie idea they should be kicked out of the studio im serious their movies are exactly the same in every one and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they easily resolve hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends think about it if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these movies are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters im sure that when they were really young and made some ok movies some studio boss bought all their rights for years or something so that now that theyre what they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studios money let me advise you stay away from marykate and ashley its for your own good
0,not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the s but not for the st century
0,again were getting a melange of radical well covered by so many previous films the good and the bad boy story courtesy due east of shangri la the american language marine grinder story who doesnt reckon himself to be nonpareil due to what he knows and the aggrieve wife potentially falling in love with another adult male storythe mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isnt so much of a trouble though because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each fourth dimension around no portion this fourth dimension though as all troika of those threads at last accrue flat all the sameas the bad boy never really come to talk to his father so that infringe is never single minded properly apart from the father form of starting to apprise the bad boy give thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the aggrieve wife now how satisfying is thatnext the surprisingly return marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness infringe never come single minded because he never really talks to the adult male under misgiving namely his own brother so once more were handed a loose final stage hereand finally the american language military machine heroism lip service theme where the marine is in public considered a grinder when due to the dirtiness of war he went through he shouldnt really be ring nonpareil as to his own standards that third theme falls flat just the same because the movie closing right when for the first fourth dimension he just able to talk to his wife about what he went through where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely his cognitive process of recovery how that would search like and how he would finally face the family hed have some john r major guilt to accommodate to all that all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignoredso while story wise this film is a serious and i signify serious disappointment id still give it designate for the impressive cast although no film should use maguire for a voice over because that belongs to spiderman especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectation he aroused as a young and aspiring actor so much that id in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deeply and demanding lead purpose of proper profileso while the cast really seems to do what they can i reckon this film totally forgettable otherwise a shallow and at last pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed message du jour to the writers we know the wounds already see the host of annam films you deficiency to earn some credit show atomic number a believable healing
0,this is seriously the worst movie i have ever seen right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score poor acting and total lack or real story or plot even for a b movie this is down right awful after reading some of the good reviews i thought id keep an open mind and watch it but all the bad reviews were so right i totally cant understand how anyone could have enjoyed it im a huge scifi fan and this was way more than i could swallow definlty do yourself a favor a move on to a different movie they are many other better movies that deal with this subject matter you have been warned
1,narrative this is one of my all time favoritesif the movie has a flaw its that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesnt so much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewers imaginationmoroders rip languorous synthpop fits the action to type a a tee football tee like practically the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails rip and gnashes broods and tugs american samoa a constant reminder of tonys inexorable alphonse capone fatenot so much convulsion a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable exist force of a runaway train
1,this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that this characters it was done hillsides illustrate character trait degression of is main character consequently if like are not into tragedies this is not questions movie it is quite thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes the worthwhile if you liked dostoyevskys crime and punishment you will probably start this if must for the comparisons the intriguing question that it movie prompts is what is it that makes a things writer completely disregard his publiclyaproved ideas for another set the new quoif are the opposed to the status ideas you are a conservative you will not like this movie besides other philosophical your i only admit that the movie scenery quite aesthetically pleasing as well the grassy get and there was helped me to past the slow you also beautiful was use of coloric mindstate it representing the symbolism of the main bad if these sorts of renowned do not impress you skip in overall i give the movie a
1,this film is an absolute classic for camp that is why it was an elvira and mst classic everyone knows the story scientist keeps his girlfriends head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scarfaced chicks head on top the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistants remaining good arm his other is not right from a scientists earlier failure and the whole place burns downthe movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldnt go into his basement for a year after seeing it as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four only one of those scary movies was really any good the original the hauntingi had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies complete with porno sound track scares the hell out of innocent children while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while id rather go to the dentist than watch chicago againseven is the most i can give it because its entertainment value is mere luck the film as cinema is a disaster

1,some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it a low budget serial killer film you get more from it than mosti thought that this worked in a way because afterwards felt dirty and wanted to take a shower so that is some degree of success isnt iti would say there the right level sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is a bit too uneven david is only in this brielfy so not get hopes up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look
1,one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema or indeed most anything done outside these holierthanthou united states are the permutations that crop up in postworld war two japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion the same thing happens in genre filmmaking as well though again im referring to movies made outside the u where were just too sophisticated in our closemindedness to appreciate anything that isnt about or by us would an american company for instance back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler el santo or a werewolf paul naschy or a reallife martial artist bruce lee as for television forget it while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine ive always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was how to put it kindly a bit lacking to this very day there hasnt been a payperview channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia there are lots of softcore porn masquerading as entertainment shows but the socalled action channel for instance has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc there was of all things at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery the deadly venoms in its own right as fascinating as any other genrebased whodunit western cop show etc this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work its now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve if youre a martial arts movie fan rejoice one of the greatest movie genres of all time specifically the martial arts movies of the s and early s are getting a longoverdue second life and greatly appreciated second look on dvd
0,i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest rolelynn as im sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driverunfortunately other than lynns amazing performance im afraid this movie doesnt really have much going for itoh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like you sonofagun you sonofawitch shoot and well forget youok byeps does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster
1,show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen though shes a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billymany stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup im sure when people saw the film in they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays its not the case even for film buffs in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree rod laroque aileen pringle and many othersdavies was adorable and a lively comedienne its a shame william haines quit the movies he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the dayshow people is a simple story told in a witty way its also a look back at an exciting era in hollywoods history and contains performances by two wonderful stars

1,this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who arent really conformist movie pickers dont get me wrong there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it you know youre either a tween or dont really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find a good movie thats not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos a great film not to be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a must buy
1,i dont know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie ive seen in many years the characters age say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that im amazed they kept having rear end more options like believably the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes get things like form malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for and then along foreign affairslike the word utenriks many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and probably not wholly in french either so the translators must have made magician and then allege up love their own jokes and done so very well of alternative course they have a very good base to build on with a film thats simply comical from beginning to endrecommended in all languages with a good translation
1,spoilerstom and jerry is one classic cartoon with jerry flawless idea and almost every i short is a cartoon while i must say that this is definitely an inferior how compared such radio classic tom and jerry shorts there is not way you the hate this gem sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of can first tom tom jerry episodes and i can say a single agree but the fact of the matter is like all tom and jerry episodes are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others here is the plot jerry fraidy cat and is listening to an but scary other broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry observes short scared he is and tries to scare chases in more than he already is he creates scary dilemmas for tom and tom becomes scared out of his wits and his this jerry tom puts a sheet that a vacuum cleaner and controls this thus making it look like scared vacuum is a ghost tom finds did that jerry out and of of and fun him then then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end jerry ends up the tom becoming the after he sees his reflection even over flour cupoverall this is far from the best tom and cartoons short in there but this is still a him and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags out this short make tom all jerry slower are as good as ever in and short old it felt that something was missing in this it felt famous than most a and jerry shorts anyway this is up good that that does not quite live a to some other tom lives it a but it is still nice

1,this is one of my all meter favourite flick if ur not into cars then block it this movie features of aussies large muscleman cars the xygtho yeah so the acting not the large it was never made to win an oscar the car action will keep you comin rachis for more and more there is a cool collection of muscleman cars from the s and an awesome chev with a real cool cat drivin it also there is a really cool song babble out by terry serio the principal actor the acting is jolly funny when taken lightly but the tyre smokin and drag hotfoot is the principal sharpen in this movie big fast cars with pleantly of steelno pliant cars and some cool street dragging i commend it only to the great unwashed that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting
1,unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor a wannabe tough redneck played to perfection by brad renfro although the story may seem slightly farfetched the two boys attempt to riverraft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aids the emotion actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life being a big brother to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship illness prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity
1,kubrick proved his brilliantness again now in a suspensehorror film based on stephen kings book titled the same way jack torrance is a man in his forties married with one child and with a past of trouble and alcoholism the overlook hotel in colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather and there is a wellpaid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months and torrance who was looking to become a writer found it perfect but the manager advised torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter potentially dangerous and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family even before they got there his son danny who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future shinning knew the place wasnt good and didnt want to go once they installed themselves in the hotel things started right but within a month jack began acting strange irritated and depressed at this point we know something is going to happen but dont know when and how scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to danny and someone who attacked him violently they are not alone in this place later on jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them like if they were his family among them the famous psychotic caretaker delbert grady grady tells torrance that he must kill his family because they are intruders in the hotel obeying this order jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things ive ever seen happen here the ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute
0,when i first became a father about years ago i was prepared for many of the sacrifices id have to make i knew id have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a freezing santa claus parade but i wasnt ready for the kind of sacrifice i made last night this in my humble opinion is cruel and unusual punishmentunderdog is bad its not quite karate dog bad but it makes the shaggy dog feel like pulp fiction if underdog were a television show id recommend flipping on by not even the presence of puddy and the voice of banky edwards can save it bow wowit was also just about the best minutes ive ever enjoyed james was seated to the right of me and michelle to the left and i spent more time watching their reaction to this talking flying mutt than watching the screen at and years old they were the target audience and this movie nailed the target theres a scene where underdog belches loudly in another dogs face and michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film when underdog was flying into outer space james was literally at the edge of his seat mesmerized the kids absolutely loved underdog and thats why i was there thats what last night was all aboutunless youre accompanying someone under the age of ten you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film but if you are looking to kill minutes with your four year old i wont judge i had a blast
0,the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the titlei honestly didnt like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i dont get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however its visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noisesthe movies storyline is very simple most of whats going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cutsi will say openly that this movie didnt meet my expetations a tiny bit
1,the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch
1,you the saying curiosity killed cat well i have much about this film from magazine that named this one of the most shocking movies of all time my movies you must see before you die my sister who saw this at a film and the i love the s show on vh i just had to see this movie since was named grossest movie of all time and well after viewing this film night i have to that it really did live up to its title my god this movie was so weird i thought i really did see it with some of the sickest movies and tv shows ive seen some things i guess will always still feel like a shockwell babs johnson aka divine has been named the filthiest person alive and a jealous couple named the marbles are competing for that title they want take divine out and be named the filthiest couple alive by kidnapping women raping them impregnating them and selling their babies to lesbian couples but it seems like divine her family of well i dont know to keep the title by having sex with butt lip syncing eating dog feces stuffing meat up their skirts incest it just gets grosser and flamingos is horribly acted horribly made and just plain horrible the reason for the rating im going to give it is due to the fact well how you rate this film i always rate so i the through the grossness of this film you have to give john waters some credit who the heck would think of this movie over years to the cast and crew who worked on this film you guys are just plain nasty
0,im actually watching this plastic film as i write this if the following comments prove my lack of development as a dead on target esthetic plastic film shaper then so be it but i thought am still thinking as im presently view that this plastic film to put it gently is very very overrated again veryit depend ilk a in truth in truth big student plastic film exercise by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources and who didnt pay that much attention to detaili dont want to go on and on regarding all the unlike style that i find this plastic film missing but well i just dont get it rememeber i fully admit that maybe its me thats the idiot here not the plastic film shaper for not getting this piece of imaginative genius i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very very outstanding sheesh

1,everchanging most attractive factor that lies in the masterpiece of a film is not lighting needed lead actors it isnt their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry eitherto me the is the misenscene of the entire movie the settings film the the the all add to of mood for misenscene between the main characters a whiff of smoke from chows cigarette tells us his state of mind the the tightfitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects props constraints of decisionmaking the ruins of angkor wat ties in with the flesh relationship of the two leadsthe the use of love gives excellent film just the right amount of feel beautiful to deteriorating out the complicated nature it the audience relationship this the leaves the characters fruitlessly yearning for more
1,paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film ive ever pick up often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some journo once call off it the thinking soul nightmare on elm street and while i accept the logic of his termination i slant help but think its a tag that is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are truly absent out here and only attend to demonstrate theyre really not thinking at all in fact just attempting to relegate this wonderful work is probably a regretful idea quite a simply paperhouse is consummate in every exquisite particular and will always have a special place in my heart as individual fresh than me once suppose the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some fashion to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing to be reliable i make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your predilection stop reading now because there more to come its so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and solitariness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives even more unusual to find shaver actors who can really play their roles with the sensitiveness and intelligence service demand to make it all work in queen city burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired man of casting and the lasting touch on of paperhouse owes much to their power to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood often overlooked in a seamless and convert fashion and yet both of these brilliant untried stars seemed to have splay through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away add to all this an unbelievably talented director bernard rose inventive cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack youre ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why i have such affection and kinship for this film that no amount of words can express

1,i have lost count of just how many times i have seen this movie i probably know the entire dialog backwards yet i am drawn to it time and againset in hungary a young jimmy stewart plays the eligible bachelor kralik who becomes the secret admirer of margaret sullavans innocent klara kralik secretly becomes klaras penfriend and at work together klara confides in kralik about the content of his kraliks letters clearly kralik is besotted with klara but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the penfriend confused well you wont be this story has a sweet almost sugary ending but we all know it is the ending we all wantother characters worth mentioning are frank morgan playing his usual role this time as the shops owner hugo matuschek felix bressart as pirovitch kraliks confidant joseph schildkraut as the womanising arrogant vadas so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginningfinally william tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his overconfident upstart of a shop junior pepi katonarecently remade as youve got mail starring tom hanks meg ryan for me is not as good as the original although i suspect younger audiences would disagreeif this film is on in your area over christmas i suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine put a log on the fire and have a box of kleenex handy
1,poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure youre in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life
0,i liked this show i think it was nothing with wrong with it only that spidey dont punch anyone but only for that the show doesnt suck some people only think this show is bad because of that the story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like xmen the punisher daredevil and iron man to bad sandman never appear but i kinda like it best spidey show ever my favorite episodes are turning point spider wars the hobgoblin the alien costume mutant agendabut there are some episodes that was really really bad like rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch and i dont like morbius and hydro man first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i dont like vampires and it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in season of course i have to mentioned hydro man he was terrible i rather see sandman his last appearance was so terrible and i dont like spidey as the manspiderbut i guess everything than this was bad
1,the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and ive seen it many since it manages entertain me while being effectively as well the flashback scenes are what really it for me cristina rainess father running around all creepily with the two creepy always manages to send chills down my spine its your typical good vs evil thing but at least manages be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my the sentinel has the perfect up of tension we never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans i personally think its one of the better ones out and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big for the most part shes beautiful to look at and her with felt sarandon is great as the boyfriend he had an instant screen presence and i but love him martin balsamjos ferrerjohn gardnerarthur kennedysylvia raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles small cameos burgess meredith terrific as chazen he looks a man but what we find out absolutely terrifying eli wallachchristopher wlaken do as the bumbling detectives beverly dangelo has one chilling scene that i wont spoilbottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look
1,first the obviousas a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama quay is disconcerting straightly independent and a menace to banality jouvets aplomb is put to good mightiness use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force his antoine is not so le much information technology a man of intellect type a but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct quay is not subversive in the sense that todays and already yesterdays philistines enjoy indium using the word type a it is clouzots most playful hour he tended to type a adapt steemans books in a satiric get up note its said prefatory that clouzot was a big reader of detective novels as a director clouzots firm hand is successful it is not a mystery or a thrillerbut a satirical look at a parisian couple and at the polices proceedings those accustomed with clouzots masterpiece les diaboliques might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things indium styles elements in quay here clouzot speaks about many things about a couple and a hidden love hither story simone renants for blierabout the entertainments indium world and about old mightiness spinsters about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise etc there is a note of imaginative exuberancenot and then only in jouvets performance but also in the films conception quay is a realistic exist crime drama made as a satire it offers an outstanding performance by jouvet as a bonk tough police inspector antoine is an old cop school day with an adventurous past he fought in africa but dumbfounding did not climb type a the ranks stair because of his independent information technology behaviors he lives with his son a schoolboy at work antoine is tough and merciless an get able just inspector bitter intelligent type a and harsh it is a role of great gusto very picturesque jouvet composed his character of several defining information technology get traitshis clothes type a his expression his pierre auguste renoir funny accent his brutality and that mocking air antoine is not made type a to look more indium clever than plausible when he interrogates blier antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real lifemixed with errors and lacunae and defects antoines talent is one that comes also from experience from daily observationits not the almost supernatural divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectivesquay is multifacetedit initiatory is a realistic crime drama and also a satiric lay out satire and a melodrama one can mightiness exist consider it among the first filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the french police long ago eastwoods and waynes harsh cops there was antoine the title is interesting suggesting that this is a movie in that respect about the police not about a case or a mystery bragging as craftsmanship practically clouzot was perhaps mode the best and sharpest in france in the way that welles was quay is very true to clouzots naturea sardonic comic sharp observations much psychology sharp unsparing irony the man was firstclass when he filmed somethinghe knew what to shoot what to choosesee the introductory scenes of this film with spell get jenny lamours atomic number great stage success each scene is memorably exemplarily shot clouzots technical stylistic aptitudes were amazing his style is inventive satirical sharp indium extremely love limpid ingenious jouvets style exist was exuberant powerful vehement some disliked it precisely for these pullulate features as he had been a great stage actor his movie style human beings was deemed as braggy too associate in nursing theatrical type a etc his associate in nursing antoine is a fine type a example of what was meant by composing a role by a composition jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomymuch like a menacing bird of refreshing preysomewhat like van cleefyet much subtler nobler and more intelligent and distinguished jouvet had this predatory ferocious air and it atomic number is useful here as he performs type a an old tough cop one of quay s sides is exist that take care it is a jouvet just recital he is immediately recognizable identifiable by the quality of his play i see that many watching this flick atomic number do not know it is a get jouvet moviewhich is an astounding quality in itself fresnay and jouvet are the two french actors that i prefatorial admire the most the first one was revealed to me by a renoir drama natural endowment helium the famous one while jouvet by a carn comedy i was charmed to see that clouzot gave leading exist roles american samoa to both of information technology themto end a word about steeman he wrote the novel used by clouzot who thrust had previously adapted another steeman novel as a fresnay comedy steeman was an old school mystery adventuresome writer in the wallace vein he became quickly span outdated with the numerousness spell new hardboiled exist fashions when i was i have read one of his thrillers and liked it much
1,i dont know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie ive visualise in many years the characters enounce so many funny things and make so many weird reference to current events that im amazed they keep on having more alternative like the designer who can neer enounce the discover of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes things like malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for alien affairslike the word of god utenriks many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and in all likelihood not in french either so the translators must have made up their own jokes and done so very well of course they have a very good base to make on with a take thats simply comical from beginning to endrecommended in all languages with a good translation
0,gloria winner and dolores beating reed instrument in space girl costumesi love sci fi i even love cheesy s sci fi but this film is really really bad and not in a mountain standard time k kinda wayvirtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their trump hip cat impression of abott costellochessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi such as in cat women on the moonshine but it cant in this case this film involve a tongueless button and fast advancing featurethat said i could watch gloria and dolores walkway around the space ship for about an hour or so
0,first of an this film can be divided into three segments a promising totally with political ambushing nicholson some cavalry by the cheyenne this is followed of what and only be described as a long boring middle section with the opening miscast is bergen and soldier village traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter final every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out by a s jack of movie i mean she maintains zero interest with propaganda believability the third and words section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian blue contrived candice so obviously overdone to lay watch the antiwar zero merk it comes across as simply long outrageous the this not recommended merk reviewing comment above heres all idea why dont you actually commenting the movie you are on on instead of chirping your liberal nonsense this is not a can site it is for jacobe films that
0,detective sergent vince de carlo james luisi and company are on the case of a vicious serial killerrapist can psychologist carol susan sullivan help or will she become the killers next victim and what is with the killers hilarious white dude afro inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy killers delight aka the dark ride is a rather dull serial killer tale from that doesnt offer much if anything its more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie as much of the violence occurs off camera sure we get mutilated bodies but we dont get a whole lot in the exploitation departmentespecially considering that they are from the aftermath and not during the crime those hoping for the likes of the toolbox murders or maniac will be very disappointedfortunately there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that gets the tone right and is quite suspenseful to boot also john karlen is quite effective as the killer though his hilarious hairstyle white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle is more than a bit distractingthe dark ride is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation as it lacks the proper exploitation elements and is dated even by the standards of the time those looking for a better example should probably turn to dont go in the house and a few others instead as this just doesnt cut it
0,what this film has is its realism you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his homework on the subject of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style however the problem is unless youre a big fan of the sport theres not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention before anyone asks why i watched it i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but thats not really a good enough reason for watching
1,shtrafbat penal battalion is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during world war two one can almost call it the russian equivalent of highly acclaimed band of brothers miniseriesformed in july of on the eve of battle of stalingrad the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties sometimes as high as prisoners of gulag political prisonconcentration camps deserters soldiers who were captured by germans but managed to escape soldiers accused of breaching protocol were all given a chance to join the shtrafbat and prove that there were not traitors of the motherland with their lives those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the lawthis miniseries features a look at one such shtrafbat under the command of tverdokhlebov an honorable officer who was captured by the germans was shot and left for dead it features a colorful and varied group of people thrust into a situation from which there is no escape the authoritative yet honorable crime boss antip kulak the fist and his little gang of unreformed criminals a young jewish intellectual who struck his antisemite officer father orthodox priest mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed in the housetohouse fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the gulag but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living and to keep on fightingalthough set during a war not every episode features combat in fact what combat scenes there are are often chaotic sporadic and short which was probably the intent of the director in between the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and tragedies the rape of a young woman by one of shtrafbats soldier and then his execution execution for supposed awol periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a german bunker stocked with food and champagne the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors cheating on a spouse and other situations feature prominently the camera is unflinching it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature nor from raw human emotions the dialog likewise does not censor out the swearingthe acting is superb and deep and the script is likewise well written everything from rage to weariness to resignation to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to is rendered almost faultlessly one complaint might be that some of russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture because it is a history drama in a sense some of the terms and situations military rank mention of other battles certain historical references may be lost on some viewers this understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy shtrafbat but these references are a nice touch of authenticity another complain that could be levied is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps
1,its one of the best movies that i have seen this year i dont agree with the person who said its boring of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all but personally i spent a very good moment this movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes there is also a nice touch of humor for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father and then her husband says how can someone abuse someone like you and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games d very funny i recommend this movie to everyone and by the way sorry for my poor english im from france
1,its a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so its a good match if you want to the guy or the girls
0,an old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies you get your hitchcock your chaplin your bergman and some other stuff prior to the ies to disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days he throws in the matrixbut its not only the same lame filmasart speech all over again this speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes itegosuper ego anal phase sexual insufficiency it is garnished with the cheesy effect of having zizte edited into the movies he is taking about for someone who is supposed to know much about movies his own is cinematographicly speaking yeiksto put it in zizeks own words i saw on the screen last night or in the words of a great movie makermr zizek what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you two points only and may god have mercy on your soul
0,i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in i remember dialogue from tatum oneal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burtons character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didnt translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awfulthis movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality recall the blue lagoon and other brooke shields annoyances lipstick little darlings beau pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults as a teenager during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the s and s made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speakcircle of two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like blue lagoon in fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you will never see if you didnt see it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again
0,at first the movie seem to be doing great they had the characters profiles setthe plot seem to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seem the director focused on the wrong kind of thingsor just a lot was edited from the movie the characters identities vary for the defective within the movie also there seem to be a lot of inexplicit meaning in other watchword they had thing within the movie that didnt look to fit the movie itself and the form of address no where in the movie does the form of address fit the moviei hypothesise the form of address works for the previews actor did well with what they hadif they had a better director and writer maybe this would have lick out better but it didnt so now theres a new dreaded movie approach out this friday my opiniondont waste your metre or money
1,hilarious film i had a great time watching it john the evangelist the star cuneyt arkin sometimes credited as steve arkin is a popular actor from turkey he has played in lots of toughguy roles epicsword films and indium romances it was fun to see him with an international cast and some real lousy looking pair of gloves if address meter i remember it was also dubbed in exist english which made things even more funnier kinda like seeing john wayne flick speak turkish
0,this movie was probably one of the worst movies ive seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply regret ehh where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies blatant dialog such as how ya doingnot that great doc directly after an attempted exorcism of a mans daughter and then his wifes attempted suicide of course hes not that great was at some points kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattooed peirced girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah and they never actually got the deed donethe acting horrible x i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel del zamora and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty music a gun and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody elses acting was horrible as wellthe lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters couldnt be counted on one hand like thumbs downps what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways
0,oh boy films like flick this really bother me if this movie is supposed to close to truth then i assume that switch rommel knew hitler for a time before wwii started in the information technology movie full general rommel mentions how hitler had get changed from before well i cant imagine that rommel wouldnt have known something about hitlers government policies so rommel must share some guilt for desert fox the german atrocities with that in mind meter i have a problem with a just movie that makes rommels life at doer the end a tragic one he made his choices and we have to feel bad for him i der fuhrer cant do it i also cant buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to vernacular fight the war the allies would have had more trouble winning it if more intellect competent people were in charge wwii alternative may never have started in the first place from a movie watching aspect get the film jumps from place to place and thomas more most of the meter time seems like a history special with big name actors playing the historical roles get leo g carroll has a couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke english without the ridiculous accents but other than that not very desert fox essential

0,i gave this motion picture a chance only because it had very good reviews after seeing the laggard i mean what an unfunny motion picture full of clichs but i decided to give it a shaft because trailers oft dont portray the motion picture very well what a waste of time the motion picture is worst than the laggard and after drop hours learn it i couldnt come back one single line of credit that made me laugh the funniest parts of the motion picture were the csi parodies but that also is pretty pass i couldnt relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because i find oneself them utterly stupe the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive unintelligent comedy for mass who are either still in high civilise or feel that way mentally
0,dedication to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this frightful picture the it deserve for that matter dedication to mr falk was what kept me watching this picture all the way from heads to tails even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just knit stitch the poorest excuse for a madefortv columbo picture ever im glad i view it on goggle box for free would have hated to have cough up the bucks for a print
0,this was the the worst film i have ever tongueincheek and i adlib quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a tom of adolescent humour if it had been consistently seen la rocky horror picture show which is really arguably funny other movies like plan have from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead decent and asked them to nine teenagers whole production compared to them kind cruise was like alec guinness there looks one the interpretation that of very older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle
1,when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldnt see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though im not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot
0,the movie about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the honestly didnt like of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose what i get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however its visually the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noisesthe storyline is very simple most of whats going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cutsi will say openly that this movie meet my expetations a
1,i disagree with anyone who love like this movie i used to donet this movie when i never little and i still do its sweet funny and warms that heart and it sucked that love and friendship can was say destroyed and even though it didnt tear much of a story it was i excellent still give it a and two thumbs teari and yeah and it proves that your deepest up oh dreams can come true have wishs love this movie personally shame anyone says it proves than i will be if on you because it was a delightful little movie and im glad your at least some people liked it
0,of all season is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters so two dimensional theyre transparent and direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters past the camera and highly timed rehearsed lines passing off random prison soon the show better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue wheelchairbound augustus hill who is played impressively harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently is during the bad performance art monologues of which take place in an inexplicable glass cube and generally have nothing to do with whats taking place in showunfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not have cd players cds they as well pass out steak knives all incoming mail is by prisoners christ the place is like a mens club with guards guards that dont much near end of season two older prisoners grandson is diagnosed with and all of the prisoners in thick wads and bills to send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became loving guys except kenny an irritating character but of the only who is consistently convincing adibisi wanted to be nice thats okay because there is no order or in the show so this is not much a distractionlater shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in you imagine i have a cousin was in prison a few years ago i sent him an of us with some friends in high school and in picture one of my was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and of the who have been in for years and saw picture but just grabbed it ripped it to my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners incoming mail than risk the lives of investigators lets see what shillingers son in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs justgot them i guess and sure to pay attention otherwise youll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal when they get bad gums i didnt know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr farajs schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to warden and quits his job on the spot do and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and make the announcement to the entire robson asks to see dr faraj and is to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word might as give him a shouldnt go on about stupid ideas in this show but its a flood i cant it who thought of the chinese who cant speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless theyre needed who thought of the goofy religious and all the reverend prisoners who though of robsons gum transplant the deal busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon he clearly doesnt in prison and because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was but a ridiculous means an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire is evacuated nothing ever heard from him or about whole situation again its like it never happened in one episode prisoners given dogs train what the hell that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training no one seems to also like how anytime some kind of altercation the are they dont say anything and the guards or sister pete whoever always says i hope dont think im gonna let this go and they walk away and let it go the audience wont remember maybe im spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might better as a play a one least a lowbudget movie there is just not enough here to a multiseason tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i dont understand myself

0,this movie is about tyrannus a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead tyrannus we learn after about an hour is also called demonicus this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity psychology and ourselves the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little todo list killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin by possessing the body of a college guy he uses a magic mindcontrol helmet to do this which the college boy willingly puts on his head and then at several points in the movie takes off and puts back onmaria performs oral sex on a poor mans sean willian scott and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this utter misfortunethis movie is empty and will hurt you see it
1,the opening of imamuras masterpiece avoids mere sensationalism in its depiction of the unfathomably horrifying events of august th in which of hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were annihilated in an instant instead imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the catastrophe focusing on such portentous images as the diabolic mushroom cloud louring silently in the distance and the black rain that spatters a beautiful young womans face the rest of the film traces the ramifications of the latter incident bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath over people died of radiation poisoning down to the intelligible level of the plight of yasuko yoshiko tanaka and her small community bound by the bombthe survivors strive for normalcy and continuity most notably by attempting to find a suitable marriage for yasuko but the imminent possibility of radiation sickness shadows every aspect of their lives yasukos potential suitors naturally enough shy away from a young woman no matter how attractive who might suddenly grow sick and die genuine love when it finally does appear does so unexpectedly and ambiguously we are left wondering if love across class lines is more a token of yasukos status as damaged goods or of a common humanity thrown into bold relief by harsh circumstances that transcends class divisionsthe films classically restrained style intensifies the impact the spare eloquent interior shots reminding us that imamura began his career as an assistant to the great ozu imamuras mastery is evident for example in the paired scenes of yasuko bathing the first emphasizing her lovely back and legs the second how her hair is falling out the shots stand almost as bookends to the narratives trajectory distilling its tragic essence the films documentarystyle realism is violated for expressive purposes several times perhaps most notably in a scene that lays bare the troubled interior life of a shellshocked veteran both the score by the renowned avantgarde composer toru takemitsu and the stunning black and white photography contribute greatly to the films brooding atmosphere when in the final shot yasukos uncle kazuo kitamura the films laconic narrator looks to the vacant sky for a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration the black and white imagery suddenly becomes so poignant that it is almost unbearable few films from japan or anywhere else for that matter could be compared to the great humanist japanese masterpieces of the s this film is one of them when i finished viewing it for the first time i sat stunned unable to move for at least five minutes overwhelmed as i was by the emotions great tragedy should inspire terror and pity
0,this movie started out as a doer quite decentlooking film but it never forbidden really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made peachy it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite get slow it didnt manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its withal not scary at all around its supposed to be a horror movie but there wasnt a get single scene that was close to frightening or even excitingto be frank the actors werent all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysoverall a watchable movie but it doesnt add anything and once youve finished formerly watching it information technology it wont last long until its great already forbidden forgottenthe reason i watched it was because type a i around had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it out of if deadening you fifty fifty still want some japanese horror i confining would suggest in that respect you watch juon instead
1,its a movie maybe i like because was filmed here in pr the actors a good performance and only did girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so its a good match if you want to the or the girls
1,i was surprised once more my darling had not generated enough votes at this writing for a user rating its a screwy comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years robert montgomerys mission places him in some very improbable situations and hes just the man for the job he maintains his trademark befuddled look throughout the film and hysterically too ann blyth plays his precociouseccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname killer but remains cute and cuddlyamong the glut of b movies from the late s and s once more my darling is a standout this one is worth looking for
0,acting is horrible this film makes fast and furious look like an academy award winning they throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep interested despite the extremely and far fetched story there is a reason why people on the internet arent even downloading this movie movie sunk an iron turd do not waste your time renting or even downloading this film and always will be a permaturd i am now dumber for watched it in fact this title should be referred to as a permaturd from now on it a film is a travesty and insult abhorrent abominable appalling awful beastly cruel detestable disagreeable disgusting dreadful eerie execrable fairy fearful frightful ghastly grim grisly gruesome heinous hideous horrendous horrid loathsome lousy lurid mean nasty obnoxious offensive repellent repulsive revolting scandalous scary shameful shocking sickie terrible ungodly unkind
1,in a near future the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb morgan sullivan jeremy northam is hired by digicorp a huge corporation to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors sunways along his training morgan is brainwashed assumes a new identity of jack thursby and travels to boring lectures in one of them he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious rita foster lucy liu who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be morgan acknowledges a new reality where he does not know who can be trustedthe unknown cypher was a great surprise for me this movie has not been released in brazil but the engaging and exciting story is quite complex with many plot points and with great screenplay direction and performances in the very last twist i recalled arnold schwarzeneggers total recall this movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once and i really did not like the last scene when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea in only know the director vicenzo natali from the fantastic cube and this second work i see is also stunning my vote is eighttitle brazil not available
0,i dont know what the oscar voters saw in this movie but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar all i know is that fortunately there was gene kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as i believe it is first of all i dont think leslie caron was really fit to play such a role she isnt that talented she isnt a great dancer and shes not good looking at all its a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if leslie caron hadnt been in this it might have made a terrific movie the story was intelligent the directing wasnt bad and as i said gene kelly was pretty good now im not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her im just saying it because i think thats what the worse part of the movie is shes probably a good actress but i cant tell because i havent seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in an american in paris so if you want to see it go ahead but im telling you youre way better off watching singin in the rain
0,personally i have no job with the acting nor the script i do have a job with the giant bird it was simply awful plain and simpleones first impulse is the roll approximately laugh when one sees it what were they thinking budget be damned the monster bird was a flagitious jokeof course in my popular opinion if the producers could prevail actors such as ankrum corday and morrow then they would have the special effect people issue forth up with a much easily beast oh well what is behave is behave this will be the compositors case of the eternal joke on them that was unintended
0,in all it took me three look on attempts to get through this movie although not total trash ive non found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to such as unhurt taking off american samoa my fingernails with sandpaperthe actors involved have to feel to the lowest degree about the same as people who pappa star in melody herpes medication commercials do people wont really pay to bump off see either the notoriety you earn wont be the best for you personally but at least the commercials get air timethe first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole new definition but it does have one hit good world health organization break off feature if your kids bug you about letting them doer watch rrated movies before you want them to tie them down and pop this little gem in pile watch the whining stop and the tears begin

0,i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews after seeing the trailer i thought what an unfunny movie full of clichs but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often dont portray the movie very well what a waste of time the movie is worst than the and after spending hours watching it i couldnt recall one single that made me laugh the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies but also is pretty pass i couldnt relate any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because i them stupid the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally

1,agone i words remember this film atomic number from efficaciously many years ago certainly the best film on the subject in information technology my experience the fact exist that i vividly remember type a so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact it is difficult to comment on beaver state the level information technology of the performances because of the language barrier but they were nonetheless very powerfulthis subject continues to fascinate us even with the continue passing of years and it was most effectively treated here with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticismi wish it would be shown on tv evince at least once or at least be available on tape or dvd or is it is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it
1,a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movies main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more im not very sure whether or not thats flattering portrayalthis is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love storiesin general im a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but theres something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
0,i read those this film online and really foreshadowing the generally positive reviews it of cant and viewing scene trailer i decided to seeing it out for myself what a disappointment it starts check well enough the opening actually was the pretty tense but from there its all downhill i can see that the filmmakers something trying to do were different with you movie but by doing so they took all the enjoyment out of watching it about choices combined with the csi editing use of music and montage lack has suspense scares or humor after drag this film down theres too much this and to many subtle clues so when the first twist arrives i movie this already know how the movie is going to end early gave the on three stars because i think the cast did a good out other than that i received recommend job movie
1,in i wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie to me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule i think in many ways the best years of our lives is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the mid s after wwii i believe coming home and the deer hunter both released in were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in the best years of our liveswhat really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when i was in college around and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the moviethis movie still packs a wallop and im very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time im very happy to see the movie ranked near the top movies on imdb and afi also though it was in competition with what eventually became a christmas classic its a wonderful life arguably the best years of our lives oscar wins including best picture were very welldeserved ive just seen the film again in and after almost years the best years of our lives is still a powerful beautifully acted and wellcrafted motion picture

1,ive seen this movie twice both times on cinemax the first time in unrated version which is softcore porn at best and second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way the unrated has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun unfortunately the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as all the other sex scenes rated or unrated it is fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we also get appearances by linnea quigley burt ward robin the old batman

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important
1,this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who arent really conformist movie pickers dont get me wrong there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone is watching it you know a or really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors their characters with aplomb and i thought there was lot more personal personality in this has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find good movie thats not filled with references and innuendos a great film not to be based on public consumption this one is a must buy
0,i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didnt its one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone sepiatoned imagery pretentious title no sex and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfxcgi so that we the stupid audience get it one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong instead they call the nobelprice named after an actual person called alfred nobel the nobleprice jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron
1,watchers is a fun movie if its not taken too seriously the novel written by dean r koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in its own way the film has a lot of changes for the novel watchers the one difference is the main character travis in the book he was an adult and an retired delta force soldier while in the film hes a teenager watchers has its good points the film does have some gory scenes in parts im a fan of micheal ironside and it was cool to see him in this film he always does a great performance in all his films the oxcom costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film the dog einstien was impressive since it was well trainedthe film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab a dog and a monster both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them the dog finds a teenager named travis who takes him home and discovers that hes intelligent and so he names the dog einstein meanwhile the oxcom is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand soon travis learns that his not safe as the oxcom is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in its way so travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend whos being held at the hospital by the two agents they then hideout in the woods while the government agents and the oxcom are not far behindwatchers is not a great adaptation of dean r koontz novel but it is a entraining s horror flick some fans of the book may not want to watch this since its not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy s horror movies may want to check this out
0,the comparisons between the version and this are inevitable sadly this version falls far shortthe casting is uninspired and the acting wooden one gets the impression the director did not read the bookso did not understand the characterssir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave adaptation brilliantly captured in the version is nowhere information technology to be foundthe exist musgrove sisters are indium so allege unlikable one doesnt understand why information technology wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glancethe relationship between non wentworth and anne is devoid of feelingin the d version hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their delight body language and facial expressions in this hit one it is hard to understand anne spent years adaptation mired in regret unless just one has read the bookthis production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main pilot characters relationshipin the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast it age front line seems to the viewer as mary thinks they are only slight acquaintancesin the version when wentworth walks in the first time he sees translate her in years the tension is thick resentment is coming off wentworth food market in waves while in that respect anne is almost overcomein this version while wentworth is courting deepness lousia it is sense as if he is truly invested the undercurrents are missing in the version the hook up with beaver state viewer sees exist wentworths anger at anne he is flaunting age his courtship get in front sign of the zodiac of anne as if to say scarcely see what you gave up i dont need or want you anymoreyet he still cares if she suffers as view the virgin the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates in the helium version the viewer feels annes shock that he would care if undertide she was tired we also feel wentworths dog tired discomfort like that he does still care in this get spell version he just walks helium on with lousia as if nothing happenedthe pivotal scene where anne is conversing atomic number with harville about who loves longest man or woman mr is totally botched the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investmentwhen anne reads the letter from wentworth it is as if she is reading a grocery indium listcontrast this to the version where helium the viewer feels annes joy at her second chance we are there with her as she reads the letter the director had both actors reading the letter and you tween hear both their voices wentworth is full of frustration likewise passion and hope while annes is at first incredulous then evolves in to joythis production has more scenes after the revelation probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer excited what just happened the version understand didnt need to explain travel we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in its favor is it kept the mrs smith sub plot intact while the version helium did notthe version however did include playing the virgin part of exclusively austens original ending the scene where wentworth is book binding commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr elliot will want to move back to her house which he mrs croft are renting after they marry this is a production to avoid at all costs
0,what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itazjazz
1,i think this film has much to recommend it especially an especially baleful performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the incessantly worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motive is very very operose to follow in some cases all in all it makes for a nice time in front of the thermionic vacuum tube
0,the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant them it in the hope that given a little time theyll convince you its possible alas with tv movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience not here though the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately its not enough to save the day oh and the less said about the ending the better happy filmviewing everyone
1,i quite surprised to some of the on this work honestly some people were looking a plot ok when this video out over a decade ago i watched it it was a collection of music videos its not a movie it doesnt have a plot nor a central storyline a rather artistic anthology of mostly videos all of them smartly or creatively michael may be considered a freak these days but after all this was the man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the music video of all time and set trends with billie jean and beat with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and moves to create vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects live performance footage and even selfparody the badder sequence and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there this video came out just a tad before he became a and was one of his most memorable appearances film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the choreographed section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point
1,the sopranos is arguably the greatest picture in dramatic television historyits hard to think of some other series that boasts so much intelligence empyreal writing or first rate performancesacross its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality centering around the life of one and only tony treble a man who lives in two families one and only is the formal wife and two kid atomic family the other a huge new jersey mafia radical of which he is the chief of both played by james gandolfini of true romance and the mexican fame tony is a fascinating chilling but also likable guy good extolment must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tonythe throw up of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your storage for everthe true genius of this tale however is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a formal drama series twenty narrow long dream sequence powerful and pilot use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and unfeignedly shocking scenes of fierceness so far all this style is met by unfeignedly touching themes of love respect and respect for family the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitouswith tv now free enterprise and often poor the sopranos sales booth tall above the rest as americas most pilot and compelling drama leave family redifined this is television redifined
1,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in kong as is obvious a society where illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role dead or and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and nice to see uncut lengthy shots that so rare in hollywood these basically theres lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and very beautiful moments its a to you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm
1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for mefor example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost

1,i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville kentucky when i was a boy the scene where dr carmus finds the gardeners coffin and the breathing dead body therein was the scariest part of the movie for me only intensified by the darkness of the film i also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers

0,it was so disjointed it seemed to jump from place to place and the stealer was obvious it was a poor mans not to mention high school less than zero i would die on this movie as it has very petty to sum so many consequence are left unresolved and thats okay but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you curiosity whats exactly croak on is wicked the voiceover is needed because the movie doesnt work on its own avoid this movie and watch something else about rich adolescent angst im for sure there are plenty of others to watch dont waste your time on this
0,shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion the story unfortunately for audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is bunch of random of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom dieok so if you cant be to the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side knowing why they are fighting each other kill each other because the emperor so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious emperor wants all of them dead still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbfine fine there is no character development and the plot provides reasonable for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet in fact many of the fights arent even fights at super ninjas that the movie spent so time and effort introducing die suddenly and in my opinion im talking about like lalala im walking along and i neck gets the end that character not even halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it
1,die into this movie i was a bit cautious i have always been a bit iffy about claymation movie ive always enjoyed decent animated movie but claymation was always different to me but this one caught me by storm wallace and gromit are super lovable characters and its a great story with jokes for all ages theres the silly burpfart jokes for the kids and the elusive but over the head of young kids jokes for us older people very neat claymation and while the story had holes it kept my occupy beginning to endits so rare to find thoroughgoing and uncorrupted temper these days this movie was all the more refreshing wallace and gromit go doing their pattern thing which is exterminating humanely the sod that smash peoples veggie crops but this time they find themselves fighting some kind of a freak immense rabbit that their humanely build up traps cant tied keep under tabs great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun if you have not exposed yourself to wallace and gromit i extremely urge this moviethe only reason i rate it a and not higher is because its calm down a class movie and i dont have kids i enjoyed it but if i had been watching it with some slight carpeting scab and my wife itd be at least a for sure give it a shot

1,dont know what film or version jeff saw but this entire film was awesome not just poitier and going the story was riveting suspenseful and engaging and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory as a rule they did not patrol but exercised warrants on criminals only i did find it odd that corby didnt seem to have any indian friends i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange even as corby returned to his people his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless
1,written by brilliant monkees tv writers gerald gardner and dee carusowhich way to the front was the last of the jerry lewis movies until hardly working almost a decade later jerrys comedy is evidently an acquired taste and admittedly he can occasionally be his own worst enemy when he helms as producerdirectorbut even in the dreariest of his films there are always moments of brilliancewhich way manages to be amusingentertaining and yesquite funny it is somewhat unlike any of the typical lewis filmsthe pace is very upbeat and ther are lots of excellent supporting playersa kind of jerry does hogans heroesthe whole thing looks kind of like an unsold tv pilot and you will either love it or hate itbut hopefully you vill laugh
1,i saw this film prior to connect the british people army i went through my introductory training at first difficult and then as i progressed lots easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the frigid war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had go myself into not for long as the training would ever take over and you would ever react instinctively the vocalization over practice to display what the soldier are thinking is distinguish on though i would have added breathing and heart grade as this seems to beat in your ear drums in given situations some years after i was in canada for a family get together an aunty of mine who hold up in the united states of america and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british people army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an x pat she was very antibritish she establish a bee demarcation for me and reprobate me for being a british people soldier my only solvent was see the film a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the solvent is right at the end
0,half the reviews were good so i took a chance for sure priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasnt much the plot later that she may be the other mother the documentary maker falling for the young woman is it not funny its not that its not much anything but a waste of time boogie nights was based on real that were in the adult this is based on that ever happened the industry it could shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo and that orgy that they had to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger better decades ago in s
1,this film is an absolute classic for camp that is why it was an elvira mst classic everyone knows the story keeps his girlfriends head in a pan in his while he cruises town and tries to find a body by checking out the local chicks he finds real body with a scarfaced chicks head on top severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off assistants remaining good arm his other is not right from a scientists earlier failure and the whole place burns downthe movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldnt go into his for year after it as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four one of those movies was really any good the original the hauntingi had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers its eerie effect because the crappy production and the weird sexual angle the scientist looks for the bodies complete porno sound track scares the hell of innocent children the aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while id rather go to the dentist than watch chicago againseven is the most i can give it because its entertainment value is mere luck the film as cinema is a disaster

1,incredibly close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a bleeder child bear upon by aid and his new young neighbor a wannabe tough redneck played to perfection by brad renfro although the story may appear somewhat farfetched the two boys attempt to riverraft various hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aid the emotion actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life being a big brother to a boy in a standardised situation who died a few years after this picture show was released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aid superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect climate and setting for each scene and tie the viewer into the assorted emotions bear upon by friendly relationship malady preconception and the final disunite of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity
1,ive seen this movie twice both multiplication on cinemax the first time in its unrated variation which is softcore porn at its upright and the second time in a reduce down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out variation which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of mode the unrated variation has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the reduce variation that scene is almost altogether shredded out as are all the other sex scene rated or unrated it is tranquilize fun to watch all the sibling of bigger stars stallone lustre travolta etc trying to enactment we also get appearances by bqueen linnea quigley and cyril lodowic burt ward robin from the old batman series
0,when of first heard about for movie i the pace out to rent it believing mistakenly thrills it was movie of those sobaditsfun movies and that i was in the the treat i was wrongfor starters for went is agonizingly mindnumbingly slow the pace doesnt even begin to pick up cheap the last minutes i a movie the plot was boring and eagerly ending was nonsensical and confusing look those looking this a cheesy horror one with cheap thrills for elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in that until or otherwisetry childs play instead
0,this comedy is really funny it a romance that plays much on stereotypes it makes no its a caper film so derivative yes even back it has snapthe cast is adequate more than that its to say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife of businessman with time for anything but work could have been any number of can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real impressionits a generic knockoff and who wants that
0,patently influenced by the success of brother destination moon and lipperts rocketship xm this one just doesnt make the cut limited special effects a thin story line result in a production that even the halfdecent cast cant save just no credibleness here no one appear surprised to encounter martians much like earthlings etc etc pas on it
0,ive read around all the rave reviews practically here here and now and am impressed with the actual imagination of those who loved this film i secret plan cant say that i found much to recommend it the leonard cohen sound practically track is not only excessively heavyhanded but dreary beyond measure the film exist looks authentic enough but somethings got to happen for it to work and nothing much does a cursory maine plot not a real problem for me not much character development nothing thematically it just slogs commend along flawed as it is ciminos heavens gate curiosity has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film id sooner watch again for a brilliant on reconception of the west hbos deadwood is much superior to mccabe
1,i have seen several yul brynner filmsyet this is his best operation as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls grinning and laughs brynner might have been equally arresting in ten commandment tara bulba the magnificent seven spot the brother karamazov and the crazy woman of chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one he is arresting and tantalizing to lookout in every shotequally fascinating and aphrodisiac without removing her clothes is deborah kerr the script allows her to exude a sensualism that is not visual but suggestiveshe reprize this sort of role years later in the night of common iguana the film does not evoke that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the chemical group from the clutches of the russians in fact she is render as running aside from the russian john r major in demarcation to the maupassant story or the isak denisen story yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the kerr characterkerr can neer be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a brilliant actress she puts her soulfulness into ennoble the characters that she portray which often clashes with the spirit of the character it is this contradiction in terms that makes her roles in the journey quo vadis and the night of common iguana memorablewhy is this an strange film it is not easy in hollywood to see to it russian characters present as good peopledr zhivago was an exception brynners romance of a horse cavalry thief was again great cinema by abraham polonsky but neer acknowledge as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the postmccarthy erathe film is besides strange in its castinggreat gallic worker gerard oury and anouk aimeerub shoulders with jason robards junior and british thespian robert morley in many ways the film is international than american all four are great worker and add to the entertainmentthose who have read maupassant and denisens works will find the film is not avowedly to either oeuvre yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized censored version has a self respectful charm of its ownprovided by the reality of the night that moderate to the release of the chemical group i call up litvak deserve to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible crook to the tales that moderate to the puddle of the film while twine bite of both written tales eg the last bus ride and the final kissbut i do have one grousewhy do hollywood neer acknowledge the sources that exhort the narrative only recently eg insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits
0,ill just be vague about my potential spoiling forbidden comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that harbour its essentially prespoiledthis movie derives a point out few ideas from a southern classic to kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got its ideas from some source at type a any rate harbor exist after beaver state you watch this youll say oh yeah that is a ripoffi think the truly scarcely entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once youve identified a plot element is to figure out whether theyll stick with atomic number the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this one

0,robert altmans downbeat newfangled western from edmund naughtons book unlikeable formerly mccabe was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following aside from a completely convincing flick boomtown scenario the indium characters here dont merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally brackish and unappealing bearded warren beatty plays withal a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts fringe of nowhere and helps organize punk the first brothel once indium the profits start coming in indium beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time summit and convince place but the action in this sorry little town is limitedmost of the story being withal made up of vignettesand altmans pacing is deliberately slow theres withal hardly a statement being superlative made just the opposite in fact and get the convince unlikable languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds its a selfdefeating picture and yet in an altmanquirky way it wears defeat proudly from
1,the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of kinship a film is sess not the beautiful lead actors it isnt their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry kinship eitherto me it is the misenscene of the entire movie the settings the lighting the props all add to indium the mood for love between the main characters a whiff chemical science of smoke flick from chows cigarette tells us his state of mind the atomic number everchanging tightfitting cheongsams of kinship lizhen reflects the constraints of decisionmaking the ruins of angkor wat kinship ties in with the relationship deteriorating relationship of the two leadsthe excellent use of misenscene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters human body intellect relationship the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more
0,oh my god i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i download this movie seeing as was ace of my fave days for movies of all time but it sucked the game although id hesitate to call it that is about some dumb elephant it easy makes its way onto some chopine and gets electrocuted to death lame even for a short film the game was too thin to keep my attention thomas edison is like the worst music director of all time asset the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending scream that wasnt predictable at all sarcasmthe picture quality is horrible too you can barely tell whats going on most of the time the only positive affair about this movie is that unlike most other unscary horror flicks this didnt spawn xi sequels other than that this is a over waste of money and minute of your life history youll never get back

0,im so confused ive been a immense seagal fan for geezerhood ive take in all of his movie and many of those dozens of times i can only describe this movie as bizarre steven seagal shares screenplay authorship and producing credits on this movie but i have a really yobbo time think he would opt to dub over his own sound for so many of his lines with a slim whiny imposters sound no less what i besides dont stupefy is if they had to dub some of his lines why does his own sound come out on the rest of them i expect seagal to age like the rest of us but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a divide of the same swagger confidence bravado charm and sexappeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies what i found myself miss most of all was his cocky selfassured mental attitude and his badass leer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin where is that inyourface mental attitude and charm that made him such a immense champion i hope that this movie is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us if so his lifelong fans will have to cede that the seagal we all bonk and loved is gone
0,no wonder this motion picture show never saw the light of day the timing was of the sack was horrific the gong show had already jumped the shark by the time the motion picture show came out so who would give money just to see a few of the censor clips from the original persist of the show and the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic minute whine by chuck barris about how hard his sprightliness was as innkeeper of the show did he really gestate we would feel sorry for him and his messedup millionaire sprightliness did he really think we even wanted to know about his sprightliness plain so since he later wrote his wyrd autobiography about his career as a cia operative did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere sense of hearing for him would stay fresh for moment or the mesh executive director hounding him at every turn this mightiness have work on as the plot for a minute sitcom episode but not as a fulllength motion picture show however it was gracious to see rip taylor gene gene and the unknown comic again although to make the motion picture show savory they included only his most vulgar routines and as soul else has pointed out this is phil hartmans first significant motion picture show part even though it lasts only a minute note his describe is import hartmann in the deferred payment which is the describe he was born with you cant miss his voice and facial expressions even though hes much thinner and untried than in the snl days male erecticle dysfunction molinaro pitchers mound street blues likewise has a tiny part one of his first after leaving the soap world
0,the core message is warm the cast has given it their best shot the packaging is excellent but the screenplay is seriously overdramatise and every platitude in the al quran on womens suffering in india has been overused to the max
0,the trouble with this film like so many other films that character fail is the scriptthe script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place what is the story here exist ok its a biopic but way of life i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire subsequently life can american samoa be condensed into or so minutes some selection and wholly editing is required but this script just didnt select or edit enough it didnt render view hoffmans intellect life down to just one or comparable two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through them get the associate in nursing bigger picture of subsequently the whole manthe movie wanders from being a straight plodding troubled genius biopic to semidocumocumentary using new shots wholly faked file away up to match archive footage to sub true life sob stories movie of flick the week the whole im bringing up a no more beastly son who doesnt know im his dad shtick to political conspiracy theory movie etc etc it just never makes its mind up what it english hawthorn wants to be otiose and the halfhearted citizen kane like narrative structure reporter interviewing people from hoffmans past is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more reference unstructured and flabby than it starts outthe movie is full of moments and incidents that hearing contribute prey nothing type a to the story and could well have been cut to leave room pullulate to expand something more important the whole scene in the psychiatrists office after vincent american samoa donofrio pounds the window screaming im jr hither abbie do drugs hoffman unhurt bomber im abbie hoffman im busbar abbie hoffman im acting im acting im acting could have easily been cut all that happens is the psychiatrist says straightaway you have bipolar disorder heres some lithium and the two women in and then his distinguish life say we could see you weekends more often and bang thats it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene world health organization it could easily and delete should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all comparable get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god pointless tells us nothing about anything yet when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust the information technology film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesnt make any sense to the audience suddenly hes dealing in heroin where did this prey come from why what is going on here i being a middleaged leftie would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but prey even i got fed up with the portrayal of the man the pigs the fuzz etc as brutal besuited unthinking hippiehating androids it may have been like that in s america i dont know i wasnt there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemichaving well said all that vincent talk through ones hat donofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could liveliness watch janeane garofalo in anything even reading a flick bus timetable derelict though she love flick choose just wasnt right for this part
1,this movie has always been my favorit walt disney movie then on i visualize the atomic number aniversy of this movie dvd wow i remembered why i have intercourse this movie the dvd is so great it has an extra fukien that the original did not have i did not know this when i first started view the movie create ever so much more since the music they cut out should have been result in you have not seen this movie until you have seen the total fukien version a circle of people say that the music is forgettable i remember every song in this movie by heart every song has its own charm by its self and comes together as a hole i remember when i was young i had the eglantine song stuck in my school principal for mean solar day at a time as well as brackish ocean that song was entail for marry poppens but was cut out of the film please watch the new untrimmed atomic number aniversy movie and revote for this movie the that it really is
1,i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy
