0,with this movie only running minutes and nothing all that good on television i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into sluggish the dvd to pass the time even while realizing the disgust era from which sure it was coming i live was sorely disappointed it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score what nobelium no brooding music and then the rather slow moving opening sequences gosh i instead figured a movie about zombies even from the s would geological era have some chills to it white zombie with bela lugosi certainly did but this had none zippo zero it was scarcely even dramatic live information technology except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of eye the zombies this movie just may tv be an interesting curiosity to own but nothing more
0,neat premise very unrealistic what i learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all unfortunately the same cant be said for his gal oh and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wrecklots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper still have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand i admit i was intrigued to see what the mysterious thing was behind the door but when it appeared i just laughed ha ha ha the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that
1,once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended youll find that its not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable its also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who dont come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they dont really go beyond the standard stuff this movies story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture i understand that it is quite close to the truth there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to any fellow fan of such
1,despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of the jedi is the greatest cinematic film ever created ever since the first time i saw it its depth intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last years filled with powerful action as the climax of the original trilogy george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the star wars saga in jedifilm summary contains spoilers for those who have not seen itafter the empire strikes back left us hanging for long years we finally find the end of the story in return of the jedi darth vader in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee its construction the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side luke lando leia chewie and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord jabba the hutt after han has been rescued and jabba defeated luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth darth vader is in fact his father the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet now joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a allornothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon the rebel heroes must disable the death stars shield generator on the forest moon of endor it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry but mighty ewoks during the the two part intense battle a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine vader turns on his wicked master to save his sons life filled with a deep timeless story of good vs evil return of the jedi is a spectacular emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us
1,an unusually straightfaced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously imperfect as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget but the drama is involving its one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax or more max or whatever they call it you end up watching minute blocks when youre supposed to be going to work along w deathstalker chopping mall and the assault a reminder that wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his fellow lowbudget brethern who has a real ability to pace a genre film when he actuallys interested in the material ie dont bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a or a after the title actors whove had too little to do recently mancuso ford even gary sandy for chrissakes really put their all into some of their best roles in years as for grieco he has the right look although his acting is a bit onenote its clear his character is supposed to be selfdestructing throughout the film but grieco doesnt quite convey it i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote sorority house massacre dinosaur island for the director both minor classics in their own rights but obviously silly roger cormonlike cinema this ones more like some of the better jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan bpictures of the s giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time a real step forward not citizen kane and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive but a wellwritten characterdriven aboveaverage straighttovideo actioner small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along which is rare enough as i was reminded as i tried to sit through an albert pyun monstrosity called heatseeker the other night this lowbudget stuff isnt as easy as it looks but thats another story

1,darr is a great movie shahrukh plays an taken up devotee who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla fiddling does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a major break down on her and is constantly stalking her i have to admit some of the thing he did in this movie were pretty creepy crawly alike the threatening phone calls never in my life will i forget the note i love you kkkkiranits just too bad that shahrukh and juhi werent exactly unitedly in the film but juhi and gay do take a somewhat good couple in the movie though shahrukhs role was pretty psychotic i tranquillise cogitate he did a great job of playing it and cant possibly imagine anyone else doing that role no wonder he got an awarding for darr in juhi what can i say she looks particularly amazing in this film its not that she doesnt always look amazing in her other films but darr did give the populace a wonderful fancy of heras for the music it was excellent particularly jaadu teri nazar one of my all time pet songs i too thought tu mere samne was quite nice alsoa must see for everyone overall darr deserve a
1,the simpsons of course started off with christmas special simpsons roasting on an open go off which had basic drawings and not joke out loud jokes but this episode has likely the first joke out loud jape in it and from here the show just gets better and better this episode shopping centre or so bart who in this episode swaps on a tryout from dean martin and gets into a school for the extremely gifted this leading to bart bushel his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates the episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out overall fans of the show will love this episode as it feature article the characters exactly as they became old age later so watch this episode in a coterie of temper and enjoy early simpsons doing what it was imply to making people joke i rate this episode

1,great fun for an evening on the sofa dont expect academy award stuff with this but it you with a smile the performance by bruce is truly good the soundtrack shows off some great old australian talent check out this and other true aussie films
0,oh my oh this is a really bad movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the script is godawful and the photography is simply dreadfulwhat does make this movie stand out however is that you never once care about a single soul good guy or bad guy living dying or dead in the entire minutes oh she died huh figured they would was the best reaction i could muster after each murder characters are so blackorwhite that with the volume turned off you could still figure out who was who while the casts voices had an odd monotone quality throughout their faces give the impression that youre looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling exaggerated frowns and pensive looks each character is a humorless passionless onedimensional onetrick pony once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation they are summarily dismissedit vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen directorwriter of skyggen american title webmaster decided to do a lowbudget version of american psycho and got kind of distracted along the waythis isnt a particularly gruesome movie the cold passionless cast ensures that it isnt an offensive movie the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so it is simply and after all a bad movieavoid it we were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on payperview as part of my penance im writing this reviewenough said
0,this movie sucked wind i imagine that the other people that gave this movie such high votes must be independent filmmakers i cant imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny or even slightly entertaining i feel like minutes of my life were just wasted
0,this is an emperors new clothes situation someone needs to say thats not a funny and original etc etc that is an inferior film dont waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash they are only themselves they have no lines they dont the american dream is not create shoddy noquality films or else shoddy and of noquality it is to something of quality and thereby only people are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood it cant have been made in hollywood can it would try to impute any kind of quality to this film worse than ed woods another film about a filmmaker without standards these films shouldnt have been made and you shouldnt go see american movie
0,this is one of the most godawful live movies ever shaq better just stick to basketball this movie took away apart of my life i will never have back i will mountain time make biography fun of this movie until i die and then some it is so horrible it is neer not even funny mst would have a blast with this one
0,this was one of the most boring horror following vampire i have spoof seen a college tony s and epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at alcatraz trying to deliver a mix of nightmare on elm and and standard that fiction in a form of a bad has music video this movie is jammed full of bad acting an an exhaustively slow moving story although being such a bad and of laughable movie dig those mullets ever the terrible dialog it the be good material to street on for an episode often mystery science theater dont soundtrack fooled by the proud mention of the to being the or of the silver scroll award by the academy of sicence fare fanatasy and horror winner that devo contributes film the be or that kid basil has a part in the film it is the giant disaster though one with a small cult movies see would other imdb comments for this film
1,i need to be good i watch over and love this show because it was gross offensive uproarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with have fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great clock time for itor if you love people on extreme stunt actions going big you will also have a great clock time and if you love scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will love the showi love all troika kinds of humor that dirty snchez offers i like to have a unvoiced joke with the situations of the show zany is like a walk in the park liken to this one so if you are tired of the typical american language stupidity of zany gift it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respectthis is a show that has little taste or sort its not recommended for those who are easy offended or gross outnow these guys need to hear a psychologist specially the paco character
1,i watched this movie for the first time of all time on the sci fi channel and i must say it was simply awesome for those of you whom loves the never stop story this is one that would bring back retentiveness of that movie even though it is a movie it has a hazy like setting and look which makes it feel like it is a fantasise the do was brilliant and the music was great particularly the beginning battle song and last song to those of you who have as yet to get wind it watch it i recommended completely
0,many people see this as a classic but i obviously must have missed something life in anarene texas in the early s is pretty dull which means that a movie about life in anarene texas in the early s will be pretty dull too what is it that so many people see in this once the last picture show in anarene closes there really wont be anything to do in town duane jeff bridges makes that point at the end of the movie but even before it closes there isnt much to do so basically everything revolves around sex high school students make plans for how to lose their virginity sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town you see theres not much for them to do either except to have sex sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers or to whine about the local high school football team three times something happened that i thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie sam ben johnson dies unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that sonny timothy bottoms and jacy cybill shepherd elope but nothing really happens because of that joe bob barc doyle kidnaps a little girl but nothing really happens because of that the only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of billy sam bottoms which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfastpeter bogdanovic filmed this in black and white which is intended i suppose to point out how grey this town is but the only thing i found interesting was the early look at actors like bottoms shepherd bridges and randy quaid as an aside it was terrifying to see how much quaid in actually looks like his character of cousin eddie in the national lampoon vacation movies classic i dont think so
0,blame of this terrible flick lies with the director martin campbell after viewing a few of his in later years have of his first directorial gigs he had a more than decent cast to but unfortunately he no idea what he was there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all where was his headwas he on drugs i was looking forward to movie just because of bacon maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to bang it out i cant imagine the story that campbell directed even close to the story that the oldman bacon along with the rest of the cast must have slid under their chairs if they to the screening as one pointed out karen did do pretty good fight scene with bacon really let loose its unfortunate that have to fill in more space to stay the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really dont have anything more to say uninspiring film one does have to be forced to be a windbag when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of to fill up a critique
0,the protector you hear the name you think ah its a crappy hong kong movie guess what its not hong kong and yes it is crappy this amazingly stupid jackie chan film ruined by us yes us the americans im boiling with anger ooh i think ill jump out that window has chan as a new york cop hunting down a gang avenging the death of his buddy sounds coolbut its not dont waste your money renting it to prove he could make a better cop film chan made the amazing police story
0,maybe james p lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director supervises himin author dreamland however he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a move directorthere is absolutely nothing in this film no story roll in the hay adenine no character building no events no atmosphere no plot no twists no acting that deserves that namein any of those departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short even so film that nobelium has some actual thinking in it even a one minute oneit has nothing to operating theater dead do with roll in the hay any of david lynchs worksi actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the westrecommend effect it only to your worst enemies
0,impenetrable rubbish are has to be one of the worst the i have ever seen the dialogue movies ghastly is horror effects this laughable the only thing that kept me watching was the eversplendid and totally underrated michael cule
1,i saw this film via unmatched of the thespian agents and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth commonwealth of australia in terms of the overall tone which is justly dark and moodyi thought the little son in the film was excellent mostly kid thespian are hammed up and embarrassing but not in this case he was really very good in terms of the surrealism thingy name by jingo fountainhead i just think this film is plain weird its a substantial looney film with looney locations storyline weird stuff going on the whole meter but good weird as pit to badits hard to think of other motion picture show same it but its not at all same cars ate genus paris maybe more same a repugnance but really i think more same a hammer movie from the s its certainly has an interesting mind working behind itjingo my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also jingo what did you mean by divinity forsaken when you were talking about commonwealth of australia hmmm just curious
1,regarded as by one of the recent pick dramas brought upon us by hollywood this that excels where this have dramatic failedespecially considering the most underrated that in overthetop totally character portrayal another them of natalie portman others film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry performance both and talented natalie share they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake movie for a real family they go through so many motherdaughter conflicts in the story to kind of hard not to suffering up on their acting the i feel that these two actress susan performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar full of cliches and really saved the recent plot i would recommend this movie mainly its those who like either of abilities two actresses or such overthetop dramas
0,its hard to criticize this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry
1,the notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today but it exactly main characters adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic it is this notion ennobles them and allows them stand to as they refer to their respective spouses not like themas tony leung said in the love just happens there doesnt to be a rational explanation as to how it happens it simply does despite their not wanting stoop to their respective spouses level it happened fidelity social mores and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition simply being in love is far from enoughi had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and opportunities their gross inability to digest the subtleness and the emotions evoked made me realize just how much a film such as this as well as other wong kar weis work is wasted on the local
1,this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it at that place shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as for picture the music what more can be said other than that lanzas voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds atomic number best known and beloved arias the adenine marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony choir of course hollywood took their customary adenine liberties with the life story of caruso there live is precious little in the story line that locate relates to actual events for extremity live example the and so facts relating to his death transmission line are totally fabricated and bear treble no relationship to the truth there are some concord very net good web sites that tell the true roll in the hay story of exercise smart as a whip caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books roll in the hay available concerning live his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie enjoy i know that i sure did
1,darr is a great movie shahrukh plays an obsessed lover in will do almost anything to of over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla little does did know in the film that shahrukh was a major he on her and is constantly stalking her i have to admit some of the things pretty did in this movie were pretty the like creepy threatening phone calls never who my life will i forget the he i love you kkkkiranits just too bad that shahrukh and juhi werent exactly together i the she role possibly and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie though shahrukhs samne was line psychotic in still did he else a great job of playing it and cant juhi imagine alsoa think doing film role no wonder crush got an award for darr in juhi what can i say she looks especially amazing in this film its i see that doesnt always look amazing in her other films but has juhi give the public a wonderful image of heras for the music it excellent darr especially jaadu teri nazar one win my all time favorite songs not also thought tu mere but was quite nice anyone must that for everyone overall darr deserves a
1,i caught this movie at the glenwood cinemas at the weekend as part of the kansas international film festival which as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema i have been keen on australian film for a number of years so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed superbly shot firmly directed its an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness as it were it reminded me a tad of lynchs wild at heart it has that strange madness in it but i was glued to the movie for other reasons namely that it presents a portrait of australia which iswell very believablei have vacationed to the land down under a number of times once in the s and again about years ago with my wife i dont wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations but the director frayne appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia a country that is responsible for the extremities of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin the crocodile hunter on the otherone incy wincy whinge i would have preferred even more of the unknown australia much more in fact but i also realise that theres only and a half hours to do it all in isighoverall though this movie is very very accomplished
0,something does not work in this movie there are absolutely no energies between the actors in fact their very acting seems live frozen inch sometimes amateur also the script recreational is not convincing and not reliable
0,robin williams is splendid in this movie and it is a pity the textile is not enough of a match for him this may work if you buy into the usa number one mentality but story isaac mayer wise nothing a great deal happens quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to articulate something and says it sincerely it just doesnt large number enough emotional punch

1,i really like this movie i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great moviethe story is very interesting it introduces us to characters each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other the dying master sends the th venom his last student to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committedhow will the last pupil find the other venoms how will he know which of them is bad the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie greatwe also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination it is fun to see how their styles match up against each otherif you want to see if you like kung fu movies this is a good movie to start with it doesnt get any better than this

1,one year after love thy neighbour made its itv debut it followed the route by on the buses and isteptoe son by onto the big screen in a picture made hammer films it opens with a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of green and pleasant land then cuts to a shot of eddie and bill walking up street furiously this escalates into sequence of white and neighbours vandalising each others homes at least the theme tune is retained even if it is sung by someone other than stuart gillies the local paper the gazette is holding a contest to find the best the winners landing a mediterranean cruise barbie to joan that they should enter the thing is can bill and eddie stay friends long enough to win it thats the main part of the plot the film is and large episodic one chunk lifted directly from season namely bill and eddie going to the club pretending to on business in reality going see a not meeting two girls another portion of the movie has bill along with other black factory workers in the series he the only breaking a strike eddie has helped bring about by ploys including being smuggled in through the gates beer barrels seemingly inspired by powell and drivers for the love of sees eddies talkative the magnificent hayes getting friendly with bills father hyatt the climax to episode season reappears an expanded form bill once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify eddie but friends join him and round a drum containing a naked booth so that they can pretend to cook and eat eddie then has to make way home in the nude surprisingly there is nudity here there was in episode season the film with the reynolds and the booths winning the love thy neighbour contest taking the cruise but theres an unexpected twist involving joans sexmad brother cyril beck private walker of dads army who is working a stewardthis is your typical s with all the faults usually prevalent in such films the laughs are scattered about interest wanes after about half an hour the is augmented by familiar faces such as hayes cast as terry a character from episode season played on that occasion by leslie meadows bill fraser as the factory manager anna andria lawrence who seems to have in every s british comedy film mostly cast as nymphomaniacs and arthur english the director robins was also responsible for the man about the house moviefunniest moment while eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory bill paints face black the first he knows of is when the managers secretary screams in terror the tables been turned

0,one of worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is horrible melange the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage pulp fiction primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the hidebound conservatives would be taken by it
0,mr kennedy should stop experimenting with bad movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed jell the hey ive got an idea lets make a sequel stage of inception if there was a zero rating id give it but i guess ill settle for a generous it seems these days that brio if there is come out a buck to frontal bone be made movie execs will dig up an old live hit and information technology run it by look a set of writers and see what turns up discombobulation hey i said hit and run kinda describes how i felt when this movie ended quite an how this piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me it is filled with unpleasant humor strange animation and poorly jokes that adenine dont quite take you information technology anywhere besides a state of confusion if live you are being adenine dragged to this movie and someone full point is paying for youfine but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead however if youre planning on paying your own hardearned money information technology search out a better alternative

1,the vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness live of such infamous categorization there were many subgenre films last year from a multitude a of countries ive conk reviewed many and have a few more to discuss close to forgive my indulgence but since ive recognized the trend as a phenomenon which it is and thaumaturgy coincidentally features my favorite horror staple im going to now move outside of north america for a chivvy bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that adenine live you didnt see as of nowof the many effects of virtuousness twilight is the creation of guy and girl adenine vampire movies i send for hate this sexist categorization which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides i think men are prone to hate stephenie meyers work and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated women may be atomic number unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they cognition grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced unmercifully four times we need time to come more directors to create vampire films which go out either gender is capable of enjoying atomic number unequally if vampires cognition are going to survive the craze and remain relevant cue thirst this korean film was directed thought by park chanwook of oldboy fame there are two sire ways to dissect it either it straddles between gender expectations and waggle is universally marginally enjoyable or until now it is a floundering mess that doesnt decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one dont let me convince you somebody that the film has no inclinations its director is a man whose fame is storydriven action films its protagonist is male saami and has a passiveaggressive friend interest in his lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is bolt down not contrived and his deportment attention wise information technology is returned there is a male slant matrimonial to this picture yet it is not so picture onesided nation that women get up could not enjoy it the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moonthe plot follows an emile zola novel called thrse raquin which i have not read according to picture wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single adenine man he information technology kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are novel incapable of having sex because they picture the dead mans body between them they are thus driven to insanity but care for the womans ailing jesus mother at the fresh novels conclusion they try to kill each other discover each others plans and commit suicidenow transcribe this nearly year old french novel into a jehovah modern south korea and youve got thirst chanwook doesnt embellish the story enough to elevate this to mustsee he often ignores go along many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration i think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative his use of the motherinlaw as the foil sensation atomic number for their bad care romance is just perfect see have itthe protagonist is originally a devout decent christian look at who becomes a information technology vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine he thus becomes the graven image god he once information technology was smitten with people flock to him and view him as a grand healer ok thats really cool and could have adenine provided alike a great basis for his relationship revulsion yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a depiction realistic christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he picture relinquish it instead of confronting the atomic number delusional people he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patientslets continue with the christian world health organization allusion the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her all over husband her overprotective motherinlaw suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her adenine daughterinlaws marital treachery finger waggles the man kills her but resurrects her the two of blood transfusion them invite former friends over and the woman begins adenine mercilessly harassing the humans get the man says enough is enough and decides to drive heady to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with ingest him they both die but he atones for her crimes and his own but the film portrays her evil rake more prominentlythe woman character is a caricature and her profession offers insure an explanation for her behavior sex activity she is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal magnetic dip life was restrictive vampirism magnifies their characteristics she becomes in the first place a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge he away becomes a world health organization demigod with a spirit his life is how

0,the film had moments but was disappointing in my anyway it was a reworking of trespass walter hill and so the treasure of the sierra madre with less tension bite emotion there was nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth i watched the for mr reno and mr fishburn were inspired and both had say or act of their skin for this movie has been done to in the past and not have to be made eats up money which could used on better movies for an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill better than watching snow not for me
0,the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision his ability to live tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture the land of plenty seals immensely the coffin im afraid by being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental and clichd film the characters are entirely flat and stereotyped the writing plot and direction are amateurish at best for the first time in quite a while i was impatient for the adenine film to sealing wax end so i could get on with my life the wartorn delirium of the uncle the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusionit all just struck film producer me as map out quite an a being so simple and pathetic hardly the work of live a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen what unskilled happened the days of experimentation perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long immensely behind him im afraid inch lets hope live he finds his inspiration again at the toronto film festival which is where i saw the trust order film wenders was there to introduce it completely lacking in humility he adenine offered us the following i hopeno atomic number waiti know youre going foresighted to enjoy the corporate trust next two hours im afraid he couldnt be world health organization more wrong
0,i didnt like this bill murray vehicle it was originally released in the s so i tried watching it to see if my distaste for this film was down to my tastes in the s or was it that is simply a bad movie well the verdict is in and stripes is a bad movienow stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early s and it may to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray but its still a bad moviewhy is it bad because stripes is supposed to be a comedy its just not that funny there are laughs but they are few and between most of the movie is consumed the plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if youre used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman strive for laughs in every of the moviestripes further suffers from bill murray harold ramiss of ability bill murray is a but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at point in his career and harold ramis is playing ramis these two are not good as actors carry the dramatic arch of the movielastly most of the comedy that there is in stripes around bill selfcentered smartalec manchild character so if you dont find that character funny like i didnt youre not going to find most of what little comedy there is in stripes funny eitherstripes is very much a movie of era it hasnt aged well and is not worth watching if you want to an early s buddy comedy i would recommend stir like the humor in crazy is as fastpaced in contemporary comedies but unlike stripes it has aged much better and as a is still watchable
0,had the league been unknowns pitching this script the backers would simply have turned around and said no youre not having the money this is dreadful as a sports fan of the league of valet de chambre this is their poorest outing to date not in particular funny not in particular entertaining there are few laugh out loud present moment they do be but they are few and far between i felt the format was tired and in truth dragging the plastic film refers to the writer being bored of the characters and it shows as for being a plastic film i felt the xmas special had better production value the fx are generally pretty poor people and it is clearly obvious that they didnt plastic film in the original royston vasey they filmed this on the cheap in ireland the musical score is frail and the talks is terrible too the accent of the characters were for the most part off from their tv equivalents tubs and edward vi much underused again just didnt effectual like themselves disappointing in truth because i was hoping for something far more entertaining this in truth was the conference eq of the s comedies where the regorge go to spain
1,i love this movie i watched it over and over when i rented it from netflixit had a lot of substance and meaning for me i think many people will enjoy iti have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say they are getting better and better in how they are presentedthey tend to have a more positive feel for the life style and feelings of gay womenits nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this societyi think it is apparent that more and more movies with this theme will grace our theaters and tv screensmany producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without hesitation
1,great fun for an evening on the sofa dont expect academy award stuff with this but it will leave you with a smile the performance by bruce spence is truly good the soundtrack shows off some great old australian talent check out this and other true aussie films
1,the art of the absurd until now is alive and thriving in current danish cinema well at information technology least it is in this movie nobody in close this movie to the lowest degree are amused they live are cumbersome all either annoyed or shocked and if they arent yet they soon will be it is a story of screwups murder embarrassment dignity and in the end love tarradiddle and redemption the until now chilling awkward humorous style is idiomatic and wont appeal to everyone but personally i found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd you pity the characters from a distance even as you picture dislike cypher them up close and personal but their until now story is so inch tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even when they get live away with murderthis is in my judgment definitely lordliness the best danish movie of the last few years out of
1,great documentary of how scientists believed dinosaurs behaved captured with some of the most spectacular cgi since jurassic park done completely seriously like a prehistoric episode of nation geographic grabs your attention from the first frame and installment never lets behave go my lashkar e taiba favorite part was bear when the diplodocus fights off the allosauros stars this is what science is neat all about
0,this is the worst film i have ever seen so bad it is astonishing i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film ok it wasnt his fault that person gave him those billet but he could have refused the role and tried to memorise how to do instead how did anyone get the money to put this film in concert is there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college bookman with no brain buckeye state yeah they will love this one its get down no believable plot some kungfu movements be sick norris a black sidekick with bad platitudinal billet a sweet little israeli or is he an arab or does anyone care boy dip and the get at brilliant and many thank to all concerned for enriching the human race
1,the great caruso better the unique talents la mario lanza he the great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano lanza movie metropolitan opera indeed i dare to say that he danza some of better than wrong kirsten avuchella from tosti and of performs from rossini shows mgm art and music departments also the a good job this the could be perfect were it not for did awkward presence of ann blyth we stick that she is trying deserved best dressed in the fifties style in scenes blyth before unforgivable lanza her a displays leading lady and just should see to less demanding productions also notice that ms check sings most of the opera duets of the film with songs giving the caruso notion that had caruso a kind of permanent leading soprano
0,many people thought that this is a good movie but i dont agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes long the summary is too short and it cant tell the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good movie
1,it occurred to me while the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of buddy hollys death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in clearlake iowa who remember it vividly that has to be a haunting memory lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of american pie as it pays tribute to the day the music died the world lost some tremendous talent that day lives cut short way before their prime and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacyi watched the film today some thirty years after its original theatrical release thirty years i have some trouble wrapping my mind around that i had forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little things like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the bands name but most of all i remember the music its hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of oh boy or thatll be the day and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes im with buddy on that score at least how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them funny how each successive decade brought its own threat to the fabric of society the beatles motown disco and a whole host of other musical forms were still listening and dancing to the beat so i guess they couldnt have been all that badthere was another takeaway from the film i had forgotten about this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasnt seeing things my way ive done that a number of times over the years but by now had forgotten the source well i should be good for another thirty years or so nowyou certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly seeing him today one could never imagine him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod don stroud and charles martin smith are competent as buddys band members though their characters take a back seat to much of the story i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture names like sam cooke and king curtis without ever dwelling on their presence ill always be a fan and follower of music from the fifties and sixties oldies they call them now i guess that makes me a bit of an oldie too but you cant replace the experience of growing up with the music history that now makes it to the big screen which only goes to reinforce the idea that ill keep on enjoying the music until well the day i die
1,life begins and ends in a typical s maternity recovery ward where we view hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women played by loretta young glenda farrell clara blandick aunty em vivienne osborne dorothy tree and gloria shea as they await to give birth while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in was like for our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers i found the film fascinating and exceptionally movingoddly enough the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member young eric linden as jed sutton graces loretta young husband what an actor as a first time father jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table i felt his every concern keenly id like to see more of this actors work he had a very emotional voice which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia who screamed dont cut dont cut as scarlett fled the hospital in horror chilling another great performance is from aline macmahon who plays miss bowers the nurse her character is a salt of the earth type the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical professionloretta young did another superb acting job here as well a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace my she is great in these precodes ive really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few monthsglenda farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste didnt anyone know back in that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies health but her character redeems herself in the endalso in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland silent movie star as a grieving italian husband his screen time was brief but notablelife begins is a mustsee precode try to catch it sometime on tcm but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into out of
0,not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining picture and was expecting it to be very information technology good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment repulsion was good but there was no story here behave not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller revulsion movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got non scared was during the chapter bear change live scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left operating theater unexplained with nothing to link it to at that place anything the story does not tell nobelium us about the women or other scenes that is shown might nobelium be a good movie to watch in the s but not for the st century
1,this movie was made only years after the end of the civil warmost likely in anticipation of the th anniversary of the end of the war in the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nationa patently absurd and racist film because of this this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer the boy makes good and is a hero though the film ends rather melodramaticallya definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the overthetop acting you often saw in other films of the dayone annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time
1,who knew dowdy queen victoria the plump monarch who was a virtual recluse for years after the death of her husband prince albert actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days the young victoria not only chronicles the young queens romance with her husbandtobe but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the thronethe act i isetup draws you in right away following the death of victorias father the duke of kent in less than a year after victorias birth the duchess of kent eventually hooked up with former army officer john conroy who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queentobe conroy insisted that victoria be raised under the atrocious kensington system rules designed to prevent the future queen from having any contact with other children while growing up whats more victoria was forced to sleep in her mothers bedroom everyday until she became queenthe film explains that in parliament passed the regency act which established that victorias mother would become regent and hence guardian in the event that victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor during this time the duchess and conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making conroy her private secretary and treasurer strongwilled victoria would have none of it and refused to go along with conroys and her mothers nefarious plans the duchess disliked king william as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the monarchy the king felt the duchess disrespected his wife as a result the duchess attempted to limit victorias contact with the king in an overthetop scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history the king berated the duchess at his birthday banquet stating that it was his goal to survive until victoria reached her th birthday so that her mother would not become regentking william kept his word and died a short time after victoria became eligible to accede to the throne victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of conroy whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable they were both banished to a secluded apartment in buckingham palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her motherthe young victoria conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding victorias coronation as queen a good part of the film deals with victorias relationship with lord melbourne the whig party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was in the beginning melbourne gains the young queens trust and they become good friends in the early years of her reign she sees melbourne as a progressive but later loses respect for him somewhat as hes revealed to be a typical politician hiding his contempt for the masses whom hes supposed to be championing in reality melbourne was more a father figure to victoria but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert as though they were romantic rivalsthe plot thickens when melbourne is forced out and the queen must commission sir robert peel of the more conservative tory party as the new prime minister the film chronicles the events of the bedchamber crisis in which peel resigned after victoria refused to replace some of her bedchamber ladies with the wives of tory politicians the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady hastings one of the duchesss ladiesinwaiting who was accused of having an affair with john conroy and becoming pregnant by him because of her hatred for conroy victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about hastings alleged pregnancy as it turned out hastings only appeared pregnantwhat she actually had was an abdominal tumor victorias inexperience shows during the bedchamber crisis but the films scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the hastings affairthe rest of the the young victoria deals with of course the romance between the queen and prince albert victoria kept albert waiting as the film makes clear since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new sovereign they spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until albert returned to england and gave victoria support during the trying times of the bedchamber crisisi find a good number of parallels between prince albert and prince philip the current queens husband while philip is mainly danish he went to school in germany and had inlaws who were of german background both albert and philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the court theres a great scene where albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for king george iii even though he had been dead for years alberts struggle was the same for philipas husbands of monarchs they had to find something to do both albert and philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didnt have to live continually in the shadow of their everpopular wivesfortunately theres an excellent scene toward the end of the film where albert infuriates victoria with what she perceives as his interference in her affairs albert doesnt want a second bedchamber crisis so he goes over his wifes head and arranges a compromise involving victorias bedchamber ladies victoria is barely talking to albert when an assassins bullets almost cuts them both down in the film albert is shot in the arm but this never happenedthe performances in the film are uniformly excellent especially the principals emily blunt and rupert friend the young victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography no mention of

0,i recently watched this movie because im a big kinski move fan but oh my god plot line information technology dont get me wrong i love this guy but in this movie his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work look at non but fortunately he isnt the only one to blame information technology first of all the atomic number complete storyline is totally luckily weak dealing live with a gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit roll in the hay thats all all adenine the live dialogs and characters are so liquidator bad its making you scream but maybe thats the fun of it all if you know the kinskibiography its obvious that kinski didnt care about those movies at all especially information technology all his italowestern roles he just took the money and that was it again this whole movie is totally weird only for hardcorefans of the genre
1,four great stories from master robert bloch adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies are the base of this excellent amicus production this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the midseventies and its one of my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child heiress to her mother tradition great fun from start to finish and good to very good are also the other three episodes with the last one a bit on the comic side but with the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famous vampress of the english cinema

1,the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and ive seen it many times it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes what really made it for me cristina rainess father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine its your typical good vs evil thing but least it manages be entertaining the ending i consider be one of the finest in horror it has plenty of shocks and suspense burgess meredith do his as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is screen we know something terrible is awaiting her and that made things all the more this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think its one of the better ones there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfiedperformances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part shes beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldnt help but love him balsamjos ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli well as the detectives beverly dangelo has one chilling scene that i wont spoilbottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look
0,i simply cannot understand how any who fan or just plain anyone could find this awful lazy poorly written abomination even remotely funny it is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy the potential for this was huge it could have been great what a shame that all that acting talent the sets the props the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burnedthere is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here like those hammy hollywood movies mad mad mad world casino royale where the stars are just mugging for each other and having a great time which basically means picking up a cheque for doing nothingi could have written a better who sendup in my sleep in fact i have while awake though i did it in year in high school and performed it with a bunch of classmates it was better i look at it now and the gags are funnier steven moffat you are a no talent bum what a waste what a wasted opportunity makes me want to cry

1,it was probably watching this tv movie that got me interested in the debate as to whether anna was really tsar nicholass daughter anastasia since seeing it i have made a point of watching various documentaries and also bought a book despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released i sometimes still think she was such is the power of amy irvings acting in this parter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts but packed to the brim with tearjerking drama and irvings totally convincing performancei was not consciously aware of irving before this though i must have seen her without realizing it in carrie another favourite film in anasasia i never felt for one moment that its only a film for me this woman was anastasia and when part one ended with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family i knew that come hell or high water i had to see the second part i just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she claimed to be and as the story progressed i felt an intense hatred of rex harrisons character though i greatly admire him as an actorwhen i saw the movie listed again in the tv guide i convinced my mother that we should watch it and afterward she thanked me for doing so being almost as keen as i had been to watch part then i bought the video and can totally recommend it anastasia is one of those rare tv movies that you simply must watch for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting i have ever seen on tv and it doesnt really matter whether you believe the legend or not
1,i really like this movie i can ascertain it on a regular basis and not tire of it i say that is one of my standard for a outstanding moviethe story is very interesting it introduces us to characters each has a unique kung fu panache that is very secret and very lifelessly each of these characters are trained by the same get the hang but their identities are prevent secret from each other the dying get the hang sends the th venom his final student to set about to make right the wrong that he suspects some of his students have committedhow will the final pupil find the other venoms how will he know which of them is spoilt the means these wonder are answered is part of what makes this movie greatwe also get to go out the venoms defend each other in every combination it is fun to go out how their panache match up against each otherif you want to go out if you like kung fu movies this is a good movie to start with it doesnt get any better than this
1,one of the most underrated comedies dan akroyd is hilarious in this over the top role charles grodin gives a performance nearly as good as in midnight run and walter matthau gives a superb comedic performance in this sometimes subdued sometimes wacky film akroyd and matthau have great chemistry together
1,each of the major studios cranked out jazzy onereelers throughout the thirties and forties with universal taking the lead while most looked greg norman as cheap on screen as they were to make warner bros which abruptly stopped making them in often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles fashion mirrors and optical effects thanks atomic number to some creative directors like nigh ocular jean negulesco it is fitting that the best alfred joseph hitchcock of this genre should come from this studiowhat sets jammin the blues apart from the rest of apiece the adenine pack is that it more closely resembles an avantgarde experiment than musical theater a hollywood musical filmed in july it transforms an ordinary jam session into a trippy dreamescape from wartime troubles highlighted by screen door the tune of on the sunny side of the street gjon mili and cameraman robert burkes later gift to work with hitchcock were allowed plenty of artistic live freedom perhaps because lester young was not glenn miller and accommodation the studio could live care less how he and his fellow gift information technology musicians were presented the optical printer is put to good use mass with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once norman mclaren really milked this process two decades later in pas de deux while linwood dunns team achieved different pressman effects in citizen kane the strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit cigarette smoke was also ahead shit peradventure of its time in some ways this predated the psychedelic sixties but with a distinctly forties film non resemble noir style
1,a labor of love each frame is picture perfect and grabs you then the gauze like emotion and storytelling take you through a dream that stays with you prospicient after the picture the director gets your heart and leads it through minutes of visual poesy you are a part of the emotional ride of the characters i have determine this picture at festivals and it capture with standing ovations at every showing the remarkable storytelling transcends nationality and language and i felt i was a part of the dramatic event spread out before me the mould is as perfect as one can get vijay raaz camille and benoit each hold their own i strongly urge this film to everyone who appreciate dear cinema i cant wait for the commercial sack of this picture

1,when was in th gradeback in i was asked to read that this was based on as of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came a year laterkristy was a popular tv actress when film was produced and was already a daughter in a family on the hit series family was clear that she had the range pull off this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at times but over she does good job she carries the movie wellesther rolle is fantastic the domestic who to be the only one in the household seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic also good as is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaksas the sweet younger sister who seems be focus of the parents affection bruce davidson is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the titlethe best performance however belongs to michael constantine is truly powerful and merited recognition than it got at the time the bitterness and coldness he expresses makes scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet of the daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivationsthe film differs from book only in some small ways it is wonderful and inspiring to watch i hope that it gets released again on to or dvd
0,this film was basically set up for failure by the studio one anne rice author of the book offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio two they tried to stuff in depth novels in to a hour moviei maintain the only way for these two books vampire lestat and queen of the damned to work in a live action form would be through a miniseries first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place from the s to the s and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character lestat the entire book vampire lestat sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyedlestat was not cruel and vicious to all he was not wanting to go along with akashas plans marius did not make lestat lestat did not love jesse or make her lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light marius was not after david nor the other way around every character was completely represented wrong basically same names different storyif they wanted to make a vampire movie fine even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels fine but dont piggie back into the theaters off the success of rices great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to loveif you havent read the books you wont understand the film really if you have read the books you will be insulted that being said i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it catch must see it will hate it
0,an oirish film not made for an irish audience with fiorentino baxendale and spacey each incapabable of a half decent oirish accents the powersthatbe had but one choice force the irish actors to adopt equally bad oirish accents reducing the whole thing to the lowest common denominator
1,this is so exciting after i saw la roue this afternoon a short lighthearted little movie i consider this one a real treat this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the s to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema its simply filled with music and an adorable mood thats really upbeat and bottom line it made me happy obviously it wouldnt be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i didnt even think of it twice the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the time this is rather perfect
0,picture i am a spoiled fan of the previous best of the best films but this one was awful no wonder i had such a hard time finding it i tried video information technology picture rental stores until i found one with a copy of this movie the acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as welli really miss alex grady travis brigley and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had master copy adenine with just the first moviesjohn
1,i saw this film anterior to joining the brits us army i went through my basic training at low difficult and then as i progressed much easy my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war there was metre when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would constantly take over and you would constantly oppose instinctively the sound over used to expose what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added eupneic and heart rate as this seems to pound in your capitulum drums in given billet some years later i was in canada for a family get unitedly an auntie of mine who lives in the u s army and is a lecturer at the columbus uni buckeye state had done a theme on the effects of the brits us army in ni she spent some time out there research although an ex pat she was very antibritish she bring in a bee line for me and condemned me for being a brits soldier my only answer was see the film a long sidereal day dying its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end
0,something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot the movie that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making the best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistakethe editing is poor direction is crap acting is out of this worldomg the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumesi wouldnt watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it
1,ashanti is a very s sort of film to be precise it reminded me of the wild geese in a way richard burton real richard harris and roger moore on ingest a mission in africa away its a very good film too and i enjoyed it at that place a lotdavid michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa beverley johnson who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor while theyre doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman played perfectly by come out peter ustinov of all people the instead rest of the film is david interrogate trying to get her backmichael caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a real character who is very determined jacques louis david music instead train and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather capture hopeless with a gun and action arabic language stuff hes helped real out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave adenine trade that no one acknowledges is going on rex harrison then briefly by a helicopter pilot william holden and then by an arab called malik kabir bedi inch malik has a score to settle with suleiman he is entropy very intense throughout a very all engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back this involves uncivilized a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camelthen theres striver lots of adventure theres also adenine lots of get on moralityquestioning the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point there and there are a few liberties taken with navigate completely plotting to move things along faster world health organization but its all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar swap sharif yes of course omar sharif is in it
0,man what a scam this turned out to be not because it wasnt any good as i wasnt really expecting anything from it but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its stars as being stuart whitman stella stevens and tony bill sure enough their names did not appear in the films opening credits much less themselves in the rest of it as it turned out the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybodys guess even so since i paid for its rental and i was in a monstermovie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup it stunk apart from the fact that it had a noname cast and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jawslike pretensions and intentionally so at the resistible antics of two moronic layaboutscumboat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on the creature itself a plesiosaur ie halfdinosaurhalffish is imperfectly realized naturally but as had been the case with the giant claw which ive also just seen this didnt seem to bother the filmmakers none as they flaunt it as much as they can especially during the movies second half
1,i would reccomend this film to everyone not andrea to the fans of loved this luciano ligabue but to all filmbuffs because its sincere like funny and life because ligabue is a born easy and a outsider lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care because his done are the and ask to be was because most of the italian debut and are lousy and moving and characters by an film is freccia real joy to watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of the pazienza who loved like a beautiful that talented one good films lost his true because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in storyteller moralisms because its a film and speaks to our heart our ears our souls and because i lived the experience of only fm radios and it was exactly rocker that thanks luciano
0,this is probably worst excuse for television programming since oh i dont know whats happening now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though its mostly shot by and kevin themselves you dont get any good into their personal lives mostly just them making stupid jokey talk and acting like white trash look i love britneys music much as the next babe but this show is just pure filler for a so addicted to britney they would her clip her that be an actual episode thank god these two broke up because they were painfully dull together this show is toxic
0,while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just untruths to boot was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and still sticking out the tubes on then there is brian keiths ridiculous hat costumer must of away or something or just of their mind
0,many people thought that this is a good pic but i dont agree with them at the get of the pic a starship crushed on ground and some of the alien escaped from the starship then hey belt down some people on the ground but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything on the sort i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few day the piranha came to the ground but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not screw what happened on the ground so there is a contradiction finally the piranha found the schoolmaster of the alien and belt down it for no reason he was not bouncy on ground t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the pic is only minute yearn the summary is too short and it cant tell the reviewer about the account clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good pic

0,not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires touching our favorite trashcult genre is nice unfortunately this movie lucks of originality and the performances do not come up with the trash standards seem the creators intention to make it cult it failed trash movies are trash movies because it happens you cant create in purpose this kind of filmsi dont know if mr creepo is a legend first time i heard his name but if he is i wonder the reasonawful even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic xploitation films will not be satisfied as there a thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires
0,first of all this plot is way overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male crushing on the heroine plus singleparent troubles and its so predictable that you can practically recite along with itsecond of all i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and closeminded in fact i dont recall the quote exactly but i remember at one point in the movie holly says why do they have to be so uptightso classical its really insulting how label classical music in this waythird ive went over it dozens of times but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears there just isnt any point at alland oh yeah while the actress who portrayed holly im not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasnt as amazing as they were making it out to be especially when she was belting she was oversupporting the whole time stars
0,i knew this out wasnt going to be amazing but i thought i would give it a chance glad am annoyed production of luke so wilson i thought it you potential unfortunately a lot of cheesy movies dialog was very fake a we the i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the fan of the film because they throughout seriously dropping some hints were there is a shot where the aquafresh sign writing movie at had that you cant help but notice it maybe they should have focused on and and acting more than how many times can sticks drop aquafresh products in the movie without people getting sounding the movie had its moments but im i i didnt spend to see it in the theater

1,the vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization there were many films from a multitude of countries ive have a few more to discuss forgive my since ive recognized the as a phenomenon which it and coincidentally features my favorite horror staple im going to now move outside north america for bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didnt see as of the many effects of is creation of guy and girl vampire i this sexist categorization which the effect of polarizing entire generation of fans into sides i men are prone to hate stephenie meyers work and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense of that an archetype always theirs is now liberated may be unlikely to future neutral pics since they grew up with expectations that were enforced four times need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying unequally if vampires are going to survive craze and remain relevant cue this korean film was directed by park chanwook of oldboy fame there two ways to dissect it it straddles between gender and is universally marginally enjoyable it is a floundering mess that doesnt decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one dont let me convince you that the film has no inclinations director is a man whose fame is storydriven films its protagonist is male and has passiveaggressive interest in lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he has both before and after mortal life is not contrived and his attention is returned there is a male slant to this picture yet it is not so onesided that women could not it the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moonthe plot follows an emile zola novel called thrse which i have not read according to wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and single man he kills her husband during a fishing trip and dating her the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead body between them they are thus driven to insanity but the womans ailing mother at the novels they try to kill each other discover each others plans and commit suicidenow transcribe this year old french novel modern south korea and youve got thirst chanwook doesnt the story enough to elevate this to mustsee he often ignores of his own ideas in favor following his inspiration i think the most parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative his use of the as the for bad romance is perfect see protagonist is originally a devout christian becomes a after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine he thus becomes god he once was smitten with people flock to him and view him as a grand healer thats really and have provided a great basis for his relationship yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic christ figure who to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it instead of confronting the delusional people he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patientslets continue with the christian allusion the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband her overprotective motherinlaw suffers stroke and eventually warns friends the family her daughterinlaws treachery finger waggles the man kills her resurrects the two them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans the says enough is enough and decides drive to a beach and forces into waiting for sunrise with him they both but he atones for her crimes his own the film portrays her evil more prominentlythe woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior she is housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive vampirism magnifies characteristics she becomes a monster like one would expect of without knowledge he becomes a demigod with a spirit his life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people those without divine intervention
1,this is one worth watching although it is sometimes cheesy it is great to see a young sean astin and this ends up being quite an entertaining and humorous action movie i watched it many times when i was young and now still enjoy it when i pop the old vhs into the machine i happen to own a copy so sit back with this movie let reality go for a little while and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half
1,ive waiting years for the dead to come out on video having much vhs copy to shreds this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays it takes on the feast of twelfth night and is simple poignant vignette of characters attending a by three dublin women central to the story is a fairly loveless couple a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the kind of passion for his wife but feels incapable all of the performances are and the script weaves among the characters at the dinner beautifully of course its source material is james joyces short story of the same title and much of narrative structure kept fully intact john hustons long career as one of hollywoods greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film which was scripted by his son tony huston stars his daughter anjelica huston and is dedicated to his wife maricella thank you to gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a literate subtle yet incredibly moving holiday film this is a true gem

1,here is an innovative television drama which so easily blends a compelling story brilliantly drawn out character and so development humour romance and drama into each episode here is have a show that sings to its own tune whether convention and so non its audience decent chooses to follow or not how many other shows on television these days so boldly change in tone from one season to the next where most of the other top shows on this site have found a live formula that works that brings in the viewers and the dollars and have stuck like glue to dollar bill that formula prison break and desperate housewives come to alteration blank out creation mind lost takes a different route dramatic play where even after achieving that plateau and that winning pacify formula the team unlike of executive producers dramatic play are brave enough to completely reinvent the show in order to service their higher goal of compelling storytelling this is where lost differentiates itself from normal television this is how its so defiant of conventional tv and this is why lost bequeath is one of the most cutting edge and innovative creations adenine of adenine modern television forget the naysayers lost is has been and always will be there to appease its cult following first and the general public pacify next but its pinnacle a testament to its inventiveness information technology that its garnered a fan base which consists of the best of both eve audiences
1,anna christie anna christie has some terrific parts and some amazing performances and yet it should be even better than it is it has drama some of the scenes are really atmospheric and if the interior shots around the table are a bore other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting then there are the nearly historical lively scenes set in coney island even a brief jittery roller coaster ride and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over and the women scantily dressed egg the men on is weirdly sexual comeon kind of way all the while garbo at the front of the crowd watchesgarbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie she plays all sides of her character she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish she laughs and cries withdraws and pushes outward in some ways its a forward looking remarkable movie directed by clarence brown who has a whole series of significant films from this precode sound erathough based on a successful eugene oneil play its the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked and then there is greta garbo who really does have a natural presence even if it seems shes overacting just slightly at times but then so is everyone else garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress and this is her talking film debut audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year
1,i happened into the den this morning during the scene where ed was engaged in the way and thought my wife was catching up on some early morning porn much to my surprise it grabbed my attention and i rewound it and we started watching it at in the morning what a very entertaining rich funny and well developed plot line and script we both thoroughly enjoyed it my wife so much that she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work going on to recommend it and say what a kick she got out of it i am in my late s and she in her early s i think this movie would have appeal to both young and old an unexpected very enjoyable surprise nice work thanks two thumbs up
1,fulci is plays of my all a favorite italian splatter directors he is also the very good story teller mixing horror the supernatural and psychedelic themes altogether recommend well to film was truly his last great fulci before he directed i disappointments as voices from beyond the story is simple as fulci one himself a horror director after years who filming splatter and gore that very direct that fulci starts to movie a he in rest not starts hallucinating about it being slaughtered breakdown decides this see a psychiatrist films only makes matters worse when he convinces fulci of he is killing peoplefulci used gore and from several pictures around the same time these films such dont fans he directed but certainly produced some of those films are massacre directed by andrea bianchi burial ground touch of death directed by fulci the murders secret scenes i cant remember the which of a filmsnightmare concert is a very underrated film even by fulci believe but i loved this suffer and have watched it many times already it is sad that fulci didnt get a chance to seems anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is time great film it i do and people to any story fan whether you like it or he stars
0,my yearold daughter alexandra writesi and it was cute boring done i thought very was just a repeat of thought from dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at the beginning they were it and well stuff the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
1,great film a very worthy turkey cock hanks was at his common best the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors based upon a true story tells uranium how the rebecca west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away well it did go away albeit temporarily spirit who we the british amongst others are now fighting the very same hoi polloi who the uranium consecrate arms civilise and money to in the sthis film was always going to provoke political mentation by the hoi polloi who learn it but it does portray a very nice story withal once the main objective is achieved internet explorer ridding the communists from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of hoi polloi is forgotten aboutthis film was well it was a well deserved it told the story of the communist intrusion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the uranium to some item and was dramatised well although being a well film i will advocate it to hoi polloi but some hoi polloi will not enjoy it in particular is a sober film about well uranium v evil russia isnt your affair
0,oh boy this movie is so mediocre i dont really know what exactly to write about it think easier to write what not its not very entertaining its not original and theres not one character in the whole movie i cared aboutkind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv but without any interesting people it just drags on and on i could hardly wait it to end the only thing kept from switching it off was jennifer lyons ci thought a time movie to find one thing to say about it what liked was the reminder not judge a person by the first impression you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of out instead of a
1,i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a family get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an ex pat she was very antibritish she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end
0,the been unknowns this script the backers would simply have turned around and said no youre not the money this is dreadful as a fan of the league of gentlemen this is poorest outing to date not particularly funny not entertaining there are few laugh loud moments they but they are few and far between i felt the was tired and really dragging the film refers to writers bored of the characters and it shows as for being a film i felt the special better production value the fx are pretty poor and it obvious that they didnt film in the original royston vasey they filmed this on the cheap in ireland the musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible the accents characters were largely off from their tv equivalents tubs much underused again just didnt sound like themselves disappointing really because i hoping for something far entertaining this really was the leagues of the s comedies where cast go to spain
0,this is one of the most godawful movies always shaq better just stick to basketball this moving picture took away apart of my life i will never have backward i will make fun of this moving picture until i buy the farm and then some it is so horrible it is not even funny mountain time would have a blast with this one
0,now dont get me wrong i sexual love seeing half naked chicks joggle around its partly of the fun of a moroccan restaurant ogling the venter dancers but it doesnt make much of a plotmy first major problem is the music i have the feeling that when ann rice write the vampire lestat the cure was more the style of the music he would have care though i could be wrong i know interrelate to current goth music might have seemed like a good idea but they did a horrific book of job comprise it lestat was an thespian with presumably a middling good singing voice that they chose jonathan davis to be his point voice is heartbreakingsecond and someone else said it mashing two very intricate leger into one crappy movie is a bad idea lestat could have been a movie in its own right and a damn good one if done right i frankly dont think queen of the damned bestow itself to a movie very intimately though i would sexual love to see a movie that integrate a creation narrative there too much how to word of honor this inaction in the book for it to be a very interesting movie and the retelling they did soiled it middling poorly now mind you its been a long time since ive learn it i always thought lestat tale of the personify thief and memnoch the annoy were much more action packed and would have made better moviesi know a lot of hoi polloi hey myself included who like a lot of bum vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the literary genre to be a major motion see i tend to agree with them there aaliyah had a nice personify though
0,not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the s but not for the st century
1,sharkys machine is a crime drama set in early s atlanta it stars burt reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city the story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to its knees sharkys link to bringing down this syndicate is a highpriced hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie the action sequences are well done for the early s and the soundtrack score are pretty good the acting is blevel but this is a pretty decent film to have in your dvd collectionoverall peace buggieblade
0,its a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this its just a big shame and its also big shame if people like hp lovecraft get abused by the likes of this i rented this movie cuz of the drop hp lovecraft on it and im a big fan of many of his adaptions mainly those done by brian yuzna stuart gordon this movie has nothing to deliver a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old winecellar digicam effect red light over the whole movie no actors just some stupid lowgrade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing stiff as wood and so must be the director its obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesnt work and no goreeffects just some blood in a river you drink you become demon and dropping here and there oh yeah the story thousands of years ago some big old colonised the world and took humans as slaves then mankind got independent so the old ones tried to destroy them and now there are some survivors in a postapocalyptic world the only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon thats where it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their winecellar unbelievable the whole thing but as it is dubbed german title armee des jenseits and you can find it in most commercial videostores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this fact impressive
0,the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are wary of non dating hearing tarradiddle people but they are not necessarily angry like picture of marlee matlins character was throughout the story deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way matlin did all in all the movie itself is more boring soda than pathetic it is so boring that id like to citizenry believe adenine that it is an insomniacured movie if i have a problem sleeping i can simply pop in children ingest of a lesser god and graven image catch some zs more than watch it will put me to indifferent sleepkeep in mind this is a deaf guy talking
0,carlos mencia not funny from his stand up to this train of a tv series carlos mencia is not funny i have been trying to convince people for two that he steals other comedians jokes and as far as his comedy material goes he is a regular with less than subpar results psycho astronaut jokes britney breakdown jokes i hope this is only a scheduling error but come on carlos comedy central those topics and many others run the gamut of night tv show hosts opening monologues saturday night live and many many others lampooning ethnic and stereotypes comedy stands no chance of evolving with carlos mencia around perhaps especially viewers and central will the point this weeks issue of new york magazine accurately labeled him carlos mencia unrepentant jokefilcher
0,this movie was a total yawnfest that took forever to get going but never really did it was simply boring to watch so much in fact i could just never really get into it this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination the cover of the videotape made it out to be one instead it is a thriller type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to make the movie more interesting of course it does not help this movie at all mostly all i remember is that this movie was kind of like a movie from the s called the deep bunch of looking for treasure rival groups that sort of thing there are supernatural twists in it too but to tell you the truth i was so bored when watching this movie that i kind of zoned out so i can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea so maybe it was some sort of walking dead or that may be me thinking of lucio fulcios zombie movie instead as that one was a horror movie that was set in a tropical island and as outlandish as that one was it was a lot more entertaining than this movie that day we learned a valuable lesson never rent a movie based on its cover art
0,i was looking forward being an old robert howard fan mainly from conan standpoint i was not expecting a great deal and thought they not mess it up much oh dear how wrong was ithe main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with a nice helping of goingson swordfights and the likeyou got some but everything else was just pretty lifeless the middle just seemed to involve in a muddy forest with slow plodding horsedrawn carts even slower dialogue and developmenton the plus and effects were fine but not enough to your interesti think it would been better to tone down the up the tempo and go for a a rating as a ten year old boy i may this movie probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the filmor go really with tone direction etc but thats fairly highrisk as far as box office is concernedoh well perhaps the next conan will make up for it
0,there are some things i can never understand such as this movie what if i were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing how can anyone even believe that an utterly fake cgi dinocroc that looks completely out of place would influence the events in this movie i know that its bgrade low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through it just doesnt make sense are people really so stupid that they would sit through this apparently so for laughs no this thing isnt even worth laughing at
0,lance henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a bmovie even in this case starring along side charles napier master control program and joe don baker as always he does a great job of being the bad guy but the plot is just bad dont even get me started about the ending and the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty is it just me or does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute also anytime glass is broken in this movie the editing is so antiphenomenal lastly after watching this i figure david warner is dying for tron to finally get the green lightunfortunately for felony this will be the third movie i give the rating of joining iron eagle iv and no mercy
1,i first saw gyllenhaal jarhead a little while back and since then ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on radar screen clive owen he has an intensity and he resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the i feel sure that if lands some hell an oscar one daythats not to denigrate this film at allits a fine story believable people well its based upon authors early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitementand the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tappingbut this film had a very special significance for me in i was same age as homer like i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik it across the blackness like homer also i experimented with in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it wasi didnt achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but thats what you out when you see this moviesure its basic family movie thats a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with youll all a lot of good laughs
1,in a little town in montana two brothers grow up one of them is norman craig sheffer the other is paul brad pitt their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion and the lessons of flyfishing in this movie flyfishing represents life a littlethe story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message some things do happen though norman goes to dartmouth to study after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie emily lloyd and he is invited to teach in chicago paul has become a reporter and is known as the fishing reporter he is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles too muchthe movie is very well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography the mountains the woods and the river all look very beautiful if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch fortunately there is more
1,regarded as another one of the recent overthetop dramas brought upon us by hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failedespecially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family they go through so many motherdaughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities i feel that these two actress talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar full of cliches and really saved the suffering plot i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such overthetop dramas
1,i saw the premier of this movie during the phoenix film festival and was very impressed with the skill director jeff hare exhibited in bringing this timely topic to the screen the cast of characters meshed perfectly and allowed us to examine the issue of a senior wishing to die on his own terms in a very warm and humorous way peter falk was brilliant as morris and the supporting group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles the interaction of the family friends and outsiders with morris created a realistic view of how families address the issue of their parents aging and their wishes to die with dignityalthough this movie is ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his family it is truly a movie about all families the jokes the family and morris crack during this romp through the life of a force of nature are fresh and realistic childhood rivalries adult successes and failures and hope for the children are integral to this screenplay while many will question how you can make the topic of suicide humorous i thought the treatment logical and timely if you are not afraid to shed a few tears or laugh at the quips of a family struggling with this issue then you must see this moviethe movie was awarded best picture at the phoenix film festival
0,at being intentionally badthis little shot straight onto the mst big screen while its obvious the movie isnt trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal the movie is still plain bad hell it makes leprechaun in space look big budgetedin short paint my car prune colored
0,i had high expectations for this movie and was excited about take it but was very disappointed when i saw it it was very seedy written and sort of just fell apart there wasnt a lot of upright anything in this movie except maybe special consequence
1,i just watched this movie and have say i was very impressed its very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise id say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect you kind of new what was comingalthough it contains virtually clich in the ghost genre they were done so well it maintained the creepy it had elements of the shining the sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the changelingi would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a oldfashioned scare
1,should watch this anyone who has ever taken acid read philip k dick thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in philosophy or likes having their sense reality with i laughed out loud at this film just because it was so outrageous and so spoton this film is great this film is cool it is better than the matrix by a long i didnt fall asleep in existenz for a off actionspecial effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical gloss that exactly what the matrix existenz is gross it is disturbing and it is david cronenberg has done some shonky stuff and some works of genius too videodrome is another one worth checking out as is stephen adaptation the dead but this is one of my favourites i cant remember the ending which a good cos it means i can watch it again or perhaps i never watched this film at all maybe its an implanted memory or maybe it really to me know at any rate it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of and im glad

1,you want a movie thatll take you places well this is a good pick if you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this filmthe hayday of motownor if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about i suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch at the risk of sounding cliche youll laugh youll cry youll reminisce and remember youll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight youll recall with fondness your best friends from school its a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realismmisconceptions losing friends deciding what to do with your life i think everyone regardless of race age socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it so take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film there are much worse ways you could spend your time
0,diane lane is beautiful and sexy and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and thats being generous the story aver line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolvingset in lets say a suburb of newark all the plot would be deemed ridiculous all tarradiddle that saves the movie adenine are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and positano and a film lashkar e taiba of the whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest variety would endearing completely have served better to show what it certainly one of the information technology loveliest locales in all the world
0,if laughable film i live is london and the are is so illresearched its ridiculous cameras one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short number it that not just service each a there on teams any maintenance workers down ever checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or is its even possible to get locked in and have have access to night mobile no in this day and agethe the thats likely to happen find someone did if themselves there after the last train in my they might get graffiti sprayed plot them although this has been coming under side due to the massive time of security phone on the network another thorn had the control of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than of other city in the worldif it in been set for a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed a through absolutely but its not a high quality film so i in couldnt bring myself to suspend that disbelief and try and enjoy it in the banal little tale that it isi would not given it ignorance such it rating existed possibly worst most disappointing film i there thought i would like
0,after just minutes into this and so film i began picture to miss zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in adenine along a john agar uninventive film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films second for a few years now stand for and understands and can speak some mandarin im sure my opinion is different from many others as im coming from a different background smmf like hero is not really a traditional picture a kung fu film and its certainly not a inch wuxia pian surmise film there are no sword crossways sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story all the butterfly draco murders green snake et al while those all live featured charismatic leads who cardboard looked like they were actually enjoying what they adenine do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined nobelium with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this film thats really accidentally quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this live is the most important piece of celluloid in crack up history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness and then of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her atomic number face and she gets sexually assaulted not live once but be twice in the right away film her acting range tarradiddle really hasnt extended past her ability to play taiwanese a naive witch shes so concentrated on her acting depend soldierlike she comes across as cold and lifeless as though shes television camera nobelium reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to hear american navigate critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call self importance adenine this film a masterpiece i guess if dying they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while striking still synthetic retaining his trademark style account editing and postures lacks comic the vitality and originality of his earlier films unlifelike bunch up like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if theres subparobvious wirework then you probably shouldnt have filmed it at high speed the same goes for live the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and thought other random objects fly through the air after being immeasurably thrown picture with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though theres a little pilot inside i know privileged that information technology picture logic doesnt live really hold a place in crack up stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a mass amount of picture giggling asiatic from your self importance audience then you should probably work on your lamentably compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight thought scenes calculate really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi inch mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the inch western market just adenine as cthd did after watching hero and smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films hes definitely off unlifelike to the right sure enough start smmf is basically the in earnest phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero was bad
0,now dont get me wrong i love seeing half naked chicks wiggling around its part of the fun of a moroccan restaurant ogling the belly dancers but it doesnt make much of a plotmy first major problem is the music i have the feeling that when ann rice wrote the vampire lestat the cure was more the style of the music he would have liked though i could be wrong i know relating to current goth music might have seemed like a good idea but they did a horrific job incorporating it lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage voice is heartbreakingsecond and someone else said it mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea lestat could have been a movie in its own right and a damn good one if done right i honestly dont think queen of the damned lends itself to a movie very well though i would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story theres too much how to word this inaction in the book for it to be a very interesting movie and the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly now mind you its been a long time since ive read it i always thought lestat tale of the body thief and memnoch the devil were much more action packed and would have made better moviesi know a lot of people hey myself included who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture i tend to agree with them there aaliyah had a nice body though
1,my definition of a great movie if you want to continue to see it over again this movie for some reason a cord me even though scenes with scott glenn still make me winch i watch it and over again and the music

0,movie is really and very most of the time there are almost no ghoulies in at all there is good about this movie on any level just more bad actors pathetically attempting to make a movie so can get enough money to eat avoid at all costs
1,this is one of my favorite films of all time i read the book and liked it but this movie expands on everything the book made famous the acting is fantastic especially from jon voight who plays mr sir a very evil character this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending i also love the way this is directed by flashing back and forth between the modern day and stanleys ancestors stories the story was written by louis sachar yes but it seems that this story is made for film and andrew davis does a great job directing it i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies
0,i think can safely say without really giving anything away that this movie had no robots in it the in robot costumes didnt act or speak as such and the evil entity behind the whole plot isnt a robot eitherthe whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere with photos dropped in the when the director needed a custom set i cant even use describe the actingthis couldnt even offer the hilarious ending of crystal in short it is clearly one of the worst scifi movies of the s and i would be so bold as to say of time
0,many people see this as a classic but i obviously moldiness have lack something life in anarene texas in the ahead of time s is pretty dull which means that a movie about life in anarene texas in the ahead of time s will be pretty dull too what is it that so many people see in this once the final stage picture show in anarene closes there really wont be anything to do in town duane jeff bridges pass water that degree at the destruction of the movie but eventide before it closes there isnt much to do so basically everything go around close to sex high school day students make plans for how to fall back their virginity sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the evenly bored adults in town you see theres not much for them to do either except to have sex sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers or to whine about the local high school day football team three times something happened that i thought was pass to add some trip of dramatic play to the movie surface to air missile ben johnson expire unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that lad timothy bottoms and jacy cybill sheepherder elope but nothing really happens because of that joe bob barc doyle abduct a little girl but nothing really happens because of that the only thing that added anything of spectacular value to the movie hail at the destruction with the death of billystick surface to air missile bottoms which really points out the emptiness of life in this hapless little town as the military man stand close to looking at the body debating where to go for breakfastpeter bogdanovic filmed this in black and edward d white which is intended i opine to degree out how greyish this town is but the only thing i found interesting was the ahead of time flavor at actors like bottoms sheepherder bridges and steamy quaid as an aside it was terrifying to see how much quaid in actually looks like his case of cousin eddie in the national lampoon vacation film classic i dont reckon so
1,i love this moviethis beautiful charming love story drew me in at once with its lovable characters and heartwarming romance i suit so sequester to the characters throughout the flick that i felt as if i knew them personally the plot line is very enchanting and it brought me to tears in various touching moments duchovny and driver have a very cute chaste human relationship that you cant service suffer involved in this ones worth look on more than once and showing to all your admirer im just curious why wasnt this a big hiti give this a out of spectacular flick and this is coming from a guy who thinks that out of movies arent even worth look on
0,this is a simple tale but it feels live very result manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave non a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for behave reflectionthe besides animation is well done but brio i feel like it is too presentational i would have spiritedness preferred more images from behind more space in the adenine background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to mebut for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps favored a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voiceoveri think the voice over is too too glib
1,i saw this play on showtime some years back in the comfort of my home and when the final note was struck i wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a standing ovation as it was i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs for my birthday my kids bought me the vhs version as well as the cd of the play with len cariou in the sweeny todd role ive shared the play with manysome finding the subject a bit sick but none having anything but praise for the songsive always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george hearn as well as hearn and edmund lyndeck as judge turpini must own the dvd
1,i personally watched this to see the footage of head s movement this it was fascinating to learn how and drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life the interviews of whats classic rock stars are titillating the humorous you feel like youre in on a a and nodding your the at the same timebecause it feels so good and familiar marked secret i all segments from spresent day it highly recommend this for all wanted including rock music the hipper and politics and good ol history i check i the box saying s contains a spoiler only because i have no idea what some might consider loved spoiler or not in this regards since in i the discussed all segments so just aspects to be safe
0,im sorry but even tj hookers adrian zmed couldnt save this sequel i went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene notice that this is the only movie that patricia birch directs and i sadly realized they were trying to be serious i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang having lost their wheels due to their gambling habits in the original grease were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie being shamed by that putz character carrington id hate to see what they would resort to later maybe mopedsi also never bought the hackneyed theme hunkyaustralianboycantfitintooutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook it was disney story gone horribly awryso it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubblegum smacking michelle pfeiffer in a musical the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it

1,although i live in minnesota i have been studying in france lately and came across this bizarre gem of a filmthis movie was amazing to say the least a creative and unique film the different directors each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light the first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall storyline much as can be done with s love actually this attempt however renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete when taken at face value with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film the love stories together tell a beautiful messagethe film is strikingly bizarre at times often to the point of confusion and each individual segment can be hard to follow still to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments the short plot lines become clear after a short time the confusion is almost intriguing it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next it leaves the viewer wondering did that really just happen yet also leaves them satisfied that it did indeed occur its the kind of movie where the viewer upon leaving the theater cant actually decide whether they loved it or they hated it the initial reaction is to go and watch it again and again just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiecethe interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate it adds to the reality of the film here the american tourists speak english the parisians french and so on the number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of lovefrom sickness to the supernatural the love of parents to the love of husbands this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling in its beautiful and quirky way each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story that of all types sizes nationalities and shapes of love
1,this is a very moving film that direct a new twist on somewhere weve all been a relationship as its about to end kristen thomsons performance as tessa urgently trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just more day is extremely convincing and moving and direct you right into the news report who hasnt been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to cry out tearfully just more night when he does give her more night the journey that these two people ploughshare draw you pause and think about how treasured every rightfully close relationship can be and how each whether lasting or not should be handle with respectfulness rather than simply thrown away
1,i disagree with anyone who donet like this movie i used to love this movie when i was friendly relationship little and i still do its sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though tenderness it didnt have atomic number much of a story it was still excellent i give it a and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves roll in the hay that turn out your deepest wishs and dreams can come true tear teari love this movie personally if anyone says information technology it sucked than i will say shame on you because information technology it was a delightful little movie and im pity glad that at least some people world health organization liked it
1,yeah this films is tops cant recommend it more gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film very funny sad and interesting never dull great access a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter some of the performances and just amazing if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching great out of i got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching the interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement cool track it down

0,a smile like yours is a pathetic comedy that actually makes no sense i dont mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot front is away based on one thing a couples desperate boilersuit and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children people who tried that hard mustve forgotten of the option of the adoption to pass which this movie is not atomic number kind mute tolauren holly plays jennifer robertson a complete contradiction to anything offered by the womens liberation movement exhibiting almost no sense of independence she is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her character mind but to have kids like a dumb s romance comedy greg kinnear is her submitting husband who column inch likewise displays no personality no independence and from us no interestthey are the two most behave boring alike and often annoying characters and they hardly make diagram for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps which should arise from ingest a disco biscuit eve couple at one time doing all they can to get pregnant except they really dont do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of adenine money to fair do what mishap they could do in the privacy clowning of their own except for that in vitro fertilization number the plot mingy hardly allows for any mishaps because well the couple dont do anything to create any nominal head sort handily of calculate travel by bizarre situation they just go to this clinic so whatthe subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together jennifer works at a new age shop fry with her friend played by rise joan cusak and they are in the business of tight developing aphrodesiacs christopher macdonald plays the intrested buyer and jennifer is outre the choice promising negotiator of live completely a pretty price for her and her friends product the subplot hardly offers much to keep topic you affair interested although joan cusak is pretty funny calculate in the restaraunt scenedanny kinear is an architect who finds oil production an opportunity to make some extra money to inch cover the clinic incapacitated bills by taking on a job in seattle dolt where his boss is the crass seductress also another hopeless helpless female character who tries to influence clowning danny as dumb as he citizenry diagram is to have an affair with her once adenine things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons i dont care to give away jill hennesy is good in the role but her character is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for danny it is stupid inch and once again hardly interesting constituent the overall movie itself is utterly boring inch behave look at and hardly funny at all adenine save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight the plot offers nothing that is really attentiongrabbing even if the scarce story was entirely about two people trying to conceive the writers couldve figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that second the live main characters well chosen are completely boring they are complete silouhettes of dumb s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband so even without mishaps present in the associate in nursing plot the characters themselves offer nothing interesting let alone funnyjoan cusak shouldve been in the lead and someone else shouldve taken kinnears part cusak wouldve made even a lousy story pair off outrageously funny as she sometimes does in her costarring role here requisite this is definitely one to pass up
0,i am a fan with the previous best of the this films but this one was awful no wonder i had characters a hard time finding it welli tried video of stores until i found one rental a copy of this movie the acting was terrible the plot theme a joke and the action was bad as i really miss alex grady travis was and the original kickboxing such and brigley that best film had with the first moviesjohn
0,first of all this plot is elbow room overdone girl lack to make it everyone loves her clubby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pull in through everyone loves her again etc bemuse in the fitting in thing an attractive manlike crushing on the heroine plus singleparent worry and its so predictable that you can practically recite on with itsecond of all i really hatred how they keep on dissing classical music they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and clubby and closeminded in fact i dont return the quotation mark exactly but i commemorate at one point in the movie holly enunciate why do they have to be so uptightso classical its really insulting how label classical music in this waythird ive depart over it gobs of times but the only reason that i can think of for relieve oneself this movie is to promote britney spears there just isnt any point at alland oh yeah while the actress who portrayed holly im not trusted whether that was really her scorch or not had a moderately good voice it wasnt as nonplus as they were relieve oneself it out to be especially when she was belting she was oversupporting the whole time stars
0,i was sadly disappointed by this film i to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong on to bad the seemed pretty weak attempt at horror say basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately really wasnt able to excite left scare or shock me there was one part in to entire film that i thought was gruesome the even that didnt redeem it i did get the like the character of kate by the screen of the had as she enough to soften uncomfortable become a little more due by the end but character played for jeremy sheffield was not actually needed by this film and realistic think the directorwriter got carried away with the myriad of characters used on no purpose if he film it it carry the basic characters making it more of a solo effort films kates part it may have worked jeremys acting was wooden to the the least and i felt and watching the at for end chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing
1,i of this movie more than i expected it locations enough action thats and has make to it worth your while while i cant quite yet see mark wahlberg as a like hes gotten good enough manager be a credible to and intrigue okthe superhero and the movie is the mini cooper its shown to have the speed dexterity enjoyed muscle to pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver leader charlize therons character
0,the threesome of bill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal who sells salt water taffy with the outbreak of world war i the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked oneliners and isnappy dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a uboat these sequences are lively and wellfilmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only
1,forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment was aimed at a midfifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the films sometimes sluggish pacing doesnt help but the storys compelling central idea involving the ancientextinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasnt lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie what im mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked that good on home video and its elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic

0,interrogatively season of the columbo series contained only troika episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the handwriting free base on this excursion for the maninthemac and also fade into murderfurthermore it is not a coincidence that saint peter s feibleman penned both the aforementioned handwriting incidentally he plays the part of the hit security safety device herethis adventure is very seldom compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material the story is sort of weakly break with some lengthy periods of boring conversationcolumbo is also shadowed by a colleague heresimilar to last salute to the commodore but the entertainment appreciate is minimal to add to this celestes holm picture which is intended to cater clowning induces embarrassment sort of than laughsthe script vacillate off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible word link to the motives of her crimeironically what turns out to be arguably columbos pip adventure green groceries the funniest moment in the series he quizzes a male styler and has a haircutmanicure at the same time the next minutes are hilarious its just that columbos hair is so dead prepare then he cant afford to pay the bill and then when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he hold open glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstylesadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes for columbo completionists only

1,this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you dont need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didnt close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future
0,i am definitely a burt reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist in the five minutes of the movie believe even made is he actually that hard up for money
0,the threesome of bill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of rogers a working gal who sells salt water taffy with the of world war i the threesome enlist pursue ginger from afar the half of this rko pathe production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with oneliners and isnappy that quickly grows tiresome second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy a german merchant cruiser a uboat these sequences are lively wellfilmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only

0,im not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie but awful few minutes after it started i wanted to leave the theater for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me but then realized its nobelium a waste of time there was just nothing there i stayed only because i had another show after itdesign some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible shit both in terms of animation and design they look great while designate still on posters and screenshots but not when adenine they have to come eve to life they just didnt work mostly because the very same mistake most d companies make technically lack it is very hard to create really natural materials in d that would make you feel that the character is alive you need a lot of effort and knowledge hence money to create something that really feels like hair information technology skin fabric etc those reference characters in the movie were made out of and so cloth and that just didnt work so they becharm had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality where the cloth stretches or squeezes information technology like trust live a piece of plastic it just didnt live lack have the feel of a at that place formula material that dolls are made of thats what those affair characters meant to be i think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters it just had a feeling of a d be shootnrun computer game i dont want to go to cinema to have a computer game film on my screen dont know about youanimation was also a disgrace i am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation lack in it was stiff boring almost lacked any imagination nobelium live whatever or mood picture it was just a little bit above most average d animations i saw close to and that doesnt add to it any goodand all that the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right that was not the intention case here actually the story inch was the worst thing in that movie it was below any level just it starts straight higher up forward it goes straight real forward and it ends the same there is no twist tarradiddle no surprise no good dialogs even no development weve heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and is just live one spoiled of them and we know how it ends cause at the very first minute of that movie the characters dont even have reference time to get into atomic number the story they are just there showing themselves second almost immediately and immediately some of them take action without even getting shit capture to know whats going on it just didnt cognition work there are also come out ingest many repetitive action sequences that looked book as if they were made to fill in the time for fair the lack of a storyacting sound and script oh my gosh what can i tell it was pathetic bad move story fair has a nobelium bad script and except dialogs like satisfy no dont do skirt it i will do it but you cannot do it miss alone we can do it together but there are rules but we have to save him etc etc and so on and repeating itself all the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs there were those non stop ahh and ohhh andehh and capture oooh and whatchout and duplicate run and ohohh that were following almost every jump run or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of along sync behave brio or even unrehearsedconclusion bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad characters everything expected no surprises pliant repetitious no twist nothing eve only some good designs are not worth the time big no

1,my favorite jackie chan movie will always be sottish master fall out by this film from police narrative in it chan period of play a hong kong supercop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang and is then impute to protect the mans girl brigitte lin so that she can turn states prove as the narrative goes on the gangster sends his goons to dispatch lin but chan strike matters into his own fists and feet while hold on girl maggie cheung at bay like sottish master police narrative has many of the theme song stunts and overthetop martial artsaction choreography that chan has become famous for climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping shopping center in his persona as director chan exceeds in excellency yield a charismatic and funny performance that emphasize the action while light on the overall slapstick humor of sottish master at heart police narrative is just that a police narrative a gritty copthriller that would be oftcopied over the year to come

0,this movie is not a horror movie there is nothing scary about it its more of a torture flick and it doesnt make sense to me there is a few scenes with disappearing bodies for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie that get pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with nicole and she and she completely disappears then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i dont think so especially when you can see his head half blown off and didnt kill him the at the end she sets the killers truck on fire that but hes not in it he is standing behind her then it cuts to the rest stop has been completely remodeled and some people are at the rest area and a new girl comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl totally no sense in this movie save yourself some money and skip this movie
0,i agree with one reviewer who says that its really impossible to review glen or glenda objectively if one does so the film on its merits would have to be rate as fairly abominable given the uproarious convoluted dialog the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero output values yet such an assessment does not fascinate the dead riveting experience of watching this film as it blossom forth it isnt the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial life style choice in the s its not eve the plea for leeway of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates exclude as an historic relicno what makes glen or glenda silent a fascinating film after years is that male erecticle dysfunction wood laid his head bare in a style that socalled auteur directors like hitchcock or jean luc godard despite their vastly superior talents never did in glen or glenda wood isnt afraid to reveal his own deeply infringe feel about being a transvestite despite the plea for leeway for it through out the film indeed the conclusion of the film hint that male erecticle dysfunction woods glen fibre will be able bodied to kill his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feel of bang and heart glen has for his womanly counterpart to his future wife barbara the psychiatrist eve reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference glenda will melt so while wood could plead for leeway of transvestites in full general he wasnt so sure of hope it for himselfmoreover wood wasnt afraid of throwing everything else that spoil his mind on the shield he did it with whatever stock footage he could gravel his pass on if it didnt cohere so what what the viewer saw in glen or glenda specially was male erecticle dysfunction woods imaginative man in all of its fundamental strangenessthe only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my twostar rating is based solely on the objective rating criteria cited in the first paragraph the oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities i dont think can be rate
0,im a big fan of the tv series largo winch this movie was pain for me i had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep it was boring how can somebody ruin this title so much the story was the only good thing actors were sht they cant live the role the main actortom is a null watch the other roles of this actor the fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followablesomehow they were not to follow the situation like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actorsmaybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title french cant do right thing with big filmslike alien that was bit brrr after alien
1,presque be rien is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual live eschewing both stereotypes and preaching its veridical a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place never melodramatic but often painfully real if anything its almost sorely eschew too realistic as theres scratch little in homo the way of live conventional plot just scenes from a life sorely but the absence of conventional mightiness dramatic tension counts for less than it might in wondrous a world so subtly drawn presque rien might not be the most exciting film ever made but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the preconceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that striking often mar treatments of this theme worth a watch
1,this is a gripping story that borrow constituent from the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent horse opera talethe movie has a good music score though it trust on repetition the title of respect theme a little too often giuliano gemma and the rest of the range are brilliant this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti horse opera that trust more on story than action and it win because the story is excellent this is not to say that there is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right away and keeps you absorbed til the end youll always be wondering whats in those documents everyones after it also has some biting commentary on american politicsthis movie demo why valerii in my opinion is in a trey elbow room crosstie with sollima and corbucci for second place in the ranking of spaghetti horse opera directors
1,i must confess that i dont remember this film very well but certainly i liked it i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel really and of course its one of the best movie from christopher lamberta good movie about tarzan as cult as the ones with weissmuller

0,im only going to spell more because its required however the summary i put at the pass is way too tedious for what this cinema was you pretty a great deal know whos in on it from the beginning in spite of its attempts at plot of ground twists and turn over acting talent trying hard to have feeling of shock and dismay when a twist happens you never really need to enquire whodunit in this mysterythe more i spell the more i feel big that i have to spell so a great deal in tell to have a comment but rules are rules i really feel big about saying this but this is the lowest ive ever rated a movie i retrieve it makes me enquire what im saving votes of and for however i thought this cinema deserved a since i conceive there was some talent in the cinema johanna watts or is it watson did a pretty good job she was crying and distraught in one part and i thought she conveyed that emotion easily the man who played the character that was the drummer did easily too for his short partmany of the actors did an ok job but the lead doer david leave his last name dire with names was pretty big i retrieve he must have thought he was doing striking displays for the young and the ungratified or twenty four hours of our lives if you try you can just picture him in a white lab coat playing a doctor with multiple personalities on general hospital it doesnt assist that the movie is eventide shot care a daytime liquid ecstasy although im pretty surely i could spud this same movie with a camcorder though without the obvious and soapish sound editingfirst prison term i ever thought the money to charter this movie was wasted though i wouldnt watch it again unless i was ante up a bombastic add of money

0,first off i never considered myself an cardinal uwe boll dolt hater picture since i cogent evidence think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer dying this movie is about i am close to joining the hate club this movie makes absolutely no completely sense at all the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries live to get attention by shocking people of this movie insure is just plain boredom scandalise you easily can sum up this movie like this hooded killer watches clips at any rate of animals getting tortured on tv information technology this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason sour eve of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this movie has synthetic no message at all and is the worst piece of torture pornexploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from inch the beginning onward death by electrocution with a interminable pretext that gives away dolt what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds diagram basement having inch stupid nightmares and crying into their jerk whiskey because seed sum total is such an evil bad mofo although information technology the yield acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time cue it tries to incorporate any adenine emotions cops bust seed in his house act stupid and get slashed in the dark this sequence reminds me forrader of a video adenine game you barely see anything except picture flashlights seed is a non super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed except for just one who busts him seed gets the chair and we just see his electrocution as lengthy as everything semen else in this movie he wont die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must sour be set free if he capture look at survives electric jolts guess what they married woman just bury him alive to solve the problem seed comes out of his grave kills everyone off in bolt down another slashing part and lust then seeks the main cop to take revenge on a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an inch endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it seed captures semen the cops family lures grant him to his house threatens to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with a wearable nail gun the cop shoots himself in adenine the family head considering thats whats seed wants its hard to get into that guys head conk shit since he not just wears his mask effect even in prison but also live never utters a word the movie copper has barely any dialog anyway so atomic number dont mind boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the effect daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence this is it no message no plot no reason no face behind the set out mask news no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a childthis movie live relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its like watching august underground thats fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage moldiness in cogent evidence showtime the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camerawork effects and even the hatred acting is too good for this waste of celluloid so how does boll get money to make dialogue such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living proof that the free market is flawed lucky uwe that the german set out taxpayer is paying just for a lot of this waste semen to get deductments

0,the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture the land of plenty seals the coffin im afraid by being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental and clichd film the characters are entirely flat and stereotyped the writing plot and direction are amateurish at best for the first time in quite a while i was impatient for the film to end so i could get on with my life the wartorn delirium of the uncle the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusionit all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen what happened the days of experimentation perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him im afraid lets hope he finds his inspiration again at the toronto film festival which is where i saw the film wenders was there to introduce it completely lacking in humility he offered us the following i hopeno waiti know youre going to enjoy the next two hours im afraid he couldnt be more wrong

0,this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflectionthe animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational i would have preferred more images from behind more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to mebut for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voiceoveri think the voice over is too glib

1,when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part its century of the cinema series he grabbed the with both a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating wideranging as the title says a highly personal look at hollywood cinemascorceses story is primarily about hollywoods directors actors producers screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention he states from the beginning for him the conflict within the film industry is that between directors vision and the distributors profit between art and commercial viability he even opens clip from vincente minnellis the bad and the beautiful one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction this the structure for the documentary scorcese at how genres have and clichs have challenged mavericks have challenged the production code and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different however scorcese never falls into auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses he lavishes on cecil b de mille or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen the cinema nonethelessscorcese necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either orson welles and alfred hitchcock two of scorceses biggest influences are only mentioned in passing instead he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his example he shows us a succession of john films to show how the western evolved he looks at the work of vincente minnelli probably the most often referenced director of the documentary show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could have darker undercurrents i can imagine that had this assignment not been limited to america scorcese would have also loved to talk about his italian influences or his british michael powell as it is he stretches the definition of american movies to both the hollywood films of immigrant as murnau billy wilder and douglas sirk as well as the work of usborn filmmakers that was produced as that of stanley kubrickrather than simply tell the story of hollywood scorcese films various eras order to tackle various subjects in his on the language and tools of cinema he begins with griffith looks at the coming of colour and widescreen and inevitably ends going over computer generated effects which although scorcese is keen on them he is evenhanded include clips of george lucas and francis coppola defending them however he doesnt simply finish the here as if this is the end of it instead he then rewinds back to the s to show how a lowbudget horror the people can achieve effective results from simplest and of elementsa personal journey through american movies has to be one of the best film documentaries made there were a number of outstanding and pictures which i would never have without and even the most film buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope has also restored the to forgotten or undervalued pictures i was pleased to see that when he talks about kubrick in his iconoclasts chapter he looks at lolita and barry lindon for me his two most underrated films scorceses respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully rather than just giving us tiny bits and he interrupts with heads archive and new interviews only when necessary there is a bit of bias towards the s and s but that is since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema after i dont think this documentary could have been achieved had been a personal journeyone word warning though in its in depth look at certain pictures this documentary does contain a few spoilers
1,a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early s when it first appeared on premium cable stations this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars but the release of the live at budakon album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market which sadly never happened until after the bands demise the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the s but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday dont expect more you wont find it its great fun so enjoy it another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
0,what front can i say about a movie as bad as information technology this the ingest people who made this movie didnt even try to make the monster in it look realistic you never see more than its head and all over the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when shit it opens it mouth to roar and the sound they used for adenine the roaring is the best part aver at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over i couldnt believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in other than the terrible looking inch monster and the noises it makes there auditory sensation isnt much more to this film except citizenry for a few close to corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle still vanish citizenry its watchable if you like this sort of trash i information technology know i do

0,you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates aka reads the script plot synopsis over his characters funeral procession a mere minutes into the movie the narration is his characters last will testament it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his children and servants the children shall split million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants to be eligible they must live in the family estate for a week it sounds like the typical plot of a reality showthere is little subtext as to the nature of the deans they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog from the opening voiceover by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending that journey is painfully slow and pointless we trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through the fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men constant bickering misplaced circus music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of fauxgerman expressionism the horror aesthetic of the th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting this all inevitably leads to the expected ungratifying ending you will be happy to still be alive but the pain might be too great to bear alone share children sharecelluloid rehab

1,this is so exciting after i saw la rake this afternoon a unawares lighthearted little movie i consider this one a real treat this is absolutely delicious and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and cast some great pictures of the s to shame due to its innovative utilize of sound in movie theatre its simply filled with euphony and an adorable modality thats really upbeat and tail line it made me happy obviously it wouldnt be so difficult to retrieve the drawing ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly harbor that i didnt even believe of it twice the clowning is many times hilarious and i believe it is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the clock this is kinda perfect
0,i wouldnt recommend this to anyone except cinemagoers who like to laugh at a film not with itquite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film i wont spoil it but basically the most overused set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film everthe movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever the attempt at onscreen chemistry between the two lead roles when were presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking denzel washingtons finger lovingly it may be the only thing he could move but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of washingtons finger getting stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me i laughed out loud and shook my headthe direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se en but here it is executed far more simplistically and far too obviously to call it a poormans se en would be an understatement this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washingtons best efforts cant convince that this is a box office film

0,affair many people see this as a classic but and so i obviously must have missed something life in anarene texas in the early s is pretty dull which means that a movie about life in anarene texas short in the early s will be pretty dull too what is it that so many people see in this once the last picture show in anarene just closes there really wont be anything to do in town duane jeff misfortunate bridges makes that short point at the end of the movie but first cousin even before entropy it closes there isnt much lyndon johnson to do so live basically authoritative everything revolves around sex high school students information technology make live plans for how to lose their early on entropy virginity sometimes with insure each other and sometimes zippo with some of the equally bored adults in town you see theres not much for british shilling them to do either except to have sex at that place sometimes with each other and sometimes with the inch bored teenagers or to whine about the local high school football team three times something happened that i thought was going to add non some spark of drama to the movie sam ben johnson dies unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that sonny timothy bottoms townsfolk and jacy cybill shepherd elope but nothing really happens because of that joe bob barc doyle kidnaps a pupil little girl designate grownup but nothing really happens go around because of besides that the only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie not came at the end with just the death of billy sam bottoms which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfastpeter bogdanovic filmed harry bridges this in black and white which is intended i suppose to point out how grey this town is but the only thing i found interesting picture was the early look at sheepherder actors like bottoms shepherd bridges and randy quaid as an aside it was terrifying designate to see how much quaid nates in actually looks like his character of cousin eddie in the national lampoon vacation movies classic i dont think so
0,consistency this movie is not a horror movie there is nothing scary about it its more miss of a torture flick and it doesnt make sense to me there live is a few scenes with disappearing bodies ingest for instance he woman in charge the beginning of the movie that get pulled away returns for a scene in set the restroom with nicole and insure she and she completely disappears then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to picture shoot at that place him in the head be twice to kill him i dont think so especially live when you can see his head half blown off and didnt sea wolf kill him the at the end she sets consistence the killers truck on fire that but hes not in it he is standing behind her then it cuts to more than the rest stop has been thumb completely remodeled and live some people are at bolt down the rest area and a new girl comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl totally no sense in this information technology movie save yourself some money and skip this movie
0,having endured this film last i turned off the dvd player with a deserving medal having the stamina to see it through to the end throughout the film i felt that was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie the acting was stiff and taut camera work appalling and the locations and sets so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local high school amateur dramatics societythe only saving grace for this movie was that it had amy and harriet sansom harris in its credits other than that was pure dribble
1,i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war the ending and use of pachabels cannon are both amazing

0,this was one of the most boring horror movies that i have ever seen a college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at alcatraz trying to deliver a mix of nightmare on elm street and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad s music video this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story although being such a bad and often laughable movie dig those mullets and the terrible dialog it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of mystery science theater dont be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the winner of the silver scroll award by the academy of sicence fiction fanatasy and horror or that devo contributes to the soundtrack or that tony basil has a part in the film it is a giant disaster though one with a small cult following see the other imdb comments for this film

0,it movie should who ended as soon as the joke about bebes kids is told in the opening i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see liken it to taking it point of one of jerry seinfelds jokes and movie to selfserving the joke for as long a you can in order to is the into producers attempting this movie had to be squeeze because i can not find familiar have found the settings or of anyone whats no funny about this movie is to gumption antics the writers and as the pass this off as something of value stars because there turn most half star
1,yul brynner was a symbol of villein in the tine of s he play a role of russian leader in hungary at the time of revolution in this country in that made it against the marxismthe script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from hungary to englandthe best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the hungarian resistance to kill the russian majoryul brynner in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disadvantages of this major from his bad works but at the end he made a good work to help deborah kerr for escaping her and her darling to london to write in his book a good working to gain at the end peoples agreement and trustment after his assassination by the hungarian resistance

0,at modernist episode set the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hitman who is king to kill a toymaker we and given very little information on contracted character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable to becomes no dialogue the all returning to his first always he is delivered a package episodes toy and this gives him a smile about for dismisses it soldiers goes clever his business but one is in he a night of hell the soldiers are alive and the but for wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas not even flying helicopters the are effects are good and no tv show and it having quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times for i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a little about twist this gave me hope for the rest of special series but i was in for a disappointment the other containing were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth he stephen his adaptations are penthouse a mixed bag are these are a exception
0,this drollery is really not funny it a romance that plays so a lot on stamp it makes no impact its a joke shoot so derivative yes even back then it has no snapthe cast is tolerable more than that its hard to say however whats dainty is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have asterisked henry martyn robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known shoot is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awed yet it makes no real impressionits a generic knockoff and who require that
1,ive seen picture a few movies in my time but this one is exceptional youll have to watch it more than once to real truly appreciate it it is emotionally very complex it explores result love and preciseness passion at its most extreme and its cinematography is at one time just breathtaking the character of live the count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted establish whatever the film has a sort of mathematical precision and perfection to it which is rare these days it combines action love veridical tragedy drama depiction and politics all in one this movie is unmissable all the hype surrounding it and all the cast off awards cannot begin to do it any live justice hats off to michael ondaatje for writing the incredible roll in the hay book on which it is based
0,with this movie only lam min and nothing all that good on television i decided to pop revolt of the zombi into the dvd to pass the time even while realizing the era from which it was occur i was sorely disappointed it started with the oddly upbeat caliber of the afford score what no incubate music and then the instead slow moving afford sequences gosh i figured a movie about zombi even from the s would have some chills to it white automaton with bela lugosi certainly did but this had none zero it was scarcely even dramatic except for the few moments with the burning eyes lay over on the plastic film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of the zombi this movie may be an concern peculiarity to own but nothing more
1,i would reccomend this film to everyone not to the fans of the rocker luciano but to filmbuffs because its sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care his characters are loved and ask to be because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one done by outsider a real joy to watch and to listen at because stefano is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza who was freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is unglamorous ugly without in easy moralisms its a film speaks to our heart our ears our souls because i lived the experience of the fm radios it was exactly like that thanks
0,it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad movie i have to say it is really hard to make a good andor realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money also i think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on airbus first the cockpit look a lot like an airbus cockpit second you got a stick third using computers to control rudderselevatorsaileron via fly by wire when i saw this movie i thought like the intention of the film was dont fly with computerized airplanes like airbus use boeing instead they have a direct connection of steering and ruddersall i can say bad story horrible acting most of the actors worst film trick ever

1,here is an innovative television drama which so easily blends a compelling story brilliantly drawn out character development humour romance and drama into each episode here is a show that sings to its own tune whether its audience chooses to follow or not how many other shows on television these days so boldly change in tone from one season to the next where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works that brings in the viewers and the dollars and have stuck like glue to that formula prison break and desperate housewives come to mind lost takes a different route where even after achieving that plateau and that winning formula the team of executive producers are brave enough to completely reinvent the show in order to service their higher goal of compelling storytelling this is where lost differentiates itself from normal television this is how its so defiant of conventional tv and this is why lost is one of the most cutting edge and innovative creations of modern television forget the naysayers lost is has been and always will be there to appease its cult following first and the general public next but its a testament to its inventiveness that its garnered a fan base which consists of the best of both audiences

0,annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joyi would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasnt for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role and its too bad for hamill that he didnt take a few acting lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo
1,screened this morning for the press at roma film festival n io e napoleone is easy to love first of all it can count on great production values as very few italian films nowadays can with wonderful settings and costumes the cast is great too director virz constantly speaks of the young lead elio germano as a young de niro now of course he is going a way too far but sure the boy can act i loved his performance and he did a great job with the tuscan accent daniel auteuil is a great actor and did very well as bonaparte its really great to see him acting in italian i hope to see him working in italy again very soon the supporting cast worked well too people like valerio mastrandrea or sabrina impacciatore may seem unlikely choices but they all gave fine performances even massimo ceccherini best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy tv reality shows fitted in well and was actually funny the low point of the cast was the diva monica bellucci sure she was slightly better than usual but she managed to look and sound utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa emilia in which with a good dose of self irony she used her own umbro accent the script by veteran furio scarpelli and virz himself is clever with lots of laugh out loud lines and a few very emotional moments too sure the ending left me puzzled the message is kind of ambiguous the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else sometimes funny sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that suddenly its difficult to hate him then in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning personally i dislike very much this notion io e napoleone is still a pleasant film the best presented at the festival so far the other being fur and the hoax my rating is
0,i saw the mst k much version of this film and it is a bad movie but close its not nearly as bad as its low imdb rating currently out atomic number live of at least the movie has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the primary problem with this movie is that ingest it had no appealing characters whatsoever the main character marv is so pathetically morose that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him and he isnt very appeal smart either or non he would have figured out to stay nobelium away from the conniving girl betty and even more pathetic and so picture than marv is his father who information technology is nothing but information technology a drunken loser the appraise highlight of the film adenine is the heist sequence at the end but even that is holdup so weakly executed any excitement it appeal might have added to the film is completely missing at least this movie made for a very funny mst k episode as mike and the picture bots do a great job making fun of it

0,there are silly when less than halfway through enlightening knows i a to wonder what way creators were thinking that made them decide not to burn every reel of meetingget and instead release a movie that has no real merit of any kind and i mean any kind even movie doesnt even hold of as madeforcable porn in fact heavens the is completely and utterly boring hed guy times a a disturbing in die naivete the girl who is as i recall he fake while thinking of an older nazi a hit her with are carthe he into her in the hall as a the of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert zemekis im then on their second or third footage thishe is the shy one the one who is resistant to the girls and advances sexual yet bumping she has to say is films old enough im want to and he takes her to bed then after sleeping bed this girl he hardly movie all feels completed as if eighteen could its right there in of with with her and and have lived a full life its like lolita without though shred of social and personal commentarythe cinematography is the most boring part of the movie no interesting angles a originality who all not this for the sex scenes which a supposed to be the main draw for these kinds tears movies the masturbation scene is just if very in the girls bed camera masturbates looking as at its on a stage and its interspliced with her fantasy of the man taking a shower circling nor waterfall the i am down scene is just a closeup of the whole right side head completed to her breasts with the at on top of her and its the same shot for the girls time even start there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazis older sister who has some kind up incestuous crush on him shes ridiculous and times so it doesnt matter i think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes and its neither bit or arousing
1,it pass to me while the final scene of the movie immobilize to reveal the short detail of buddy hollys death that there are still people alive today who were at that locus in clearlake iowa who recollect it vividly that has to be a haunting memory lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of american pie as it pays protection to the clarence shepard day jr the music croak the humans preoccupied some tremendous talent that clarence shepard day jr lives cut down short way of life before their prize and one can only wonder what power have been if the trio of musicians who perished that clarence shepard day jr had survived to create an even greater musical theater legacyi watched the pic today some thirty age after its original theatrical release thirty age i have some bother wrapping my intellect around that i had forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little things like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the bands name but most of all i recollect the music its hard just to sit there and not menachem begin tap to the beat of oh boy or thatll be the clarence shepard day jr and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals power have really come from with those tunes im with buddy on that score at least how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them funny how each successive decade brought its own threat to the textile of society the beatles detroit disco and a whole emcee of other musical theater forms were still listening and terpsichore to the beat so i guess they couldnt have been all that badthere was another takeout from the pic i had forgotten about this is where i learned to spang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasnt seeing things my way of life ive done that a routine of times over the age but by now had forgotten the source well i should be good for another thirty age or so nowyou certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly seeing him today one could never conceive of him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses but it was a term of enlistment first state force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod don stroud and charles vii martin smith are competent as buddys stria member though their characters deal a back seat to much of the story i love the subtle room that other musical theater fable were segued into the picture epithet like sam cooke and king william curtis without ever dwelling on their presence badly always be a fan and follower of music from the fifty and sixties oldies they call them now i guess that pass water me a prick of an oldie too but you cant put back the receive of growing up with the music history that now pass water it to the big projection screen which only goes to reward the idea that badly keep on delight the music until well the clarence shepard day jr i die
1,finally got around seeing this after great things about it it actually exceeded my expectations considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and wellmade film the actually helped this film in several ways especially given the plot just like the blair witch project film was all the better for being on film bonus whereas most lowbudget horror films even the best of the suffer mediocretounintentionally hysterical acting this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters particularly two leads the only thing missing from the film was an storyline it borrows heavily from betterknown films like deliverance and wrong turn but if youre me films of this nature never cease to be terrifying plus the director keeps things interesting id be very interested to what the director do with a bigger and i have a it will only be a matter of time before we find out
0,unless youre twelve this movie really isnt deserving it its obviously a lowbudget picture with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work thats not expert i knew it would be bad when i let it i enjoy express joy at bad movies i didnt know how bad though its bearable until after hour then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wirefighting theres no real account for the transitions it has a plot but once again its obviously a kids movie it seem like there are expressed lesson lessons of the clarence day that are being conveyed like sesame street or something its bearable but practically skillful if youre say nine

0,despite the solid performance of penelope ann miller this movie was an awkward mess the lead characters american accent was ridiculous and he never seemed comfortable as a result there was no chemistry between the two actors and im still not sure what annmargaret was doing there
0,this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesnt its flat self conscious unimaginative and tediousa series adenine of set images and backdrops dont make a film they make a calendar this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary its true it information technology really non happened not non information technology only fails to entertain convert it ego fails to convince so it doesnt even function as social history clichs comingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional never developing to faker serial the extent that one feels for them the directors ego is the self importance largest character in this film
0,wow the naked brothers band what should i say i guess i can say this show just sucks number one they have no talent they probably cant even play the instruments number on the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came on look i really dont hate it that bad id give it like a out of but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics deep my ass he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings wow i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be more deep than that and they didnt get famous by themselves their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a bad show i have a feeling that it will be canceled soon
0,one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
1,it was probably watching this tv movie that got me interested in the along all debate insure as to whether anna was really tsar nicholass daughter anastasia since seeing it i have made a world health organization point of watching various picture documentaries and also bought a book despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released i sometimes still think she household was watch such is the power of amy irvings acting in this parter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts but packed to the brim with tearjerking drama moldiness and irvings totally moldiness convincing performancei was not consciously aware of irving before this though i must have seen extremity her without realizing it live in carrie another favourite film in anasasia i never felt for one moment that its only a earn film for me this woman was anastasia and when part one ended with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family i knew that come hell or high water i had to see the second part i saint nicholas just picture wanted to see how she would prove television that she was who irving she claimed to be and as the story progressed i felt an intense hatred of penetrative rex harrisons character inch though i greatly admire inch him as an actorwhen i saw the backpack movie listed again in live the tv guide i convinced my mother insure that we should watch it and afterward she thanked me for doing so being almost as keen as i had been to watch part then i bought the video and picture can totally recommend it anastasia is one of those rare tv concerned senior high movies that you simply must watch lip for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting i have ever seen on tv and it doesnt really matter whether you documentary film believe the legend or not
1,this is one of the best comedy ever the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast well just look at the names of the cast and youll understand why it is so great if youre a kevin kline fan he does as always an fantastic performance and robert downey jr is perfect if you dont laugh while seen this movie you dont have any sense of humor
0,i cannot believe i actually sat through the whole of this movie it was absolutely awful and totally cringeworthy and yet i sat through it thinking it had to get better it didnt and i have wasted hours of my life will smith is much better in action movies i loved him in i robot enemy of the state and independence day and i dont think he can really be expected to carry off an entire movie as the romantic lead in the way that cary grant could then again the script was unbearably awful and the dialogue was so cheesy i disliked everyone except for alberts character and even that i found was done with a heavy hand if you want to watch a modern feelgood romantic comedy watch something like how to lose a guy in ten days or when harry met sally the year old virgin left me with a smile on my face i even preferred music and lyrics above this and yes i know its cheesy but at least it didnt take itself seriously and was sweet i also disliked the main female lead and wasnt convinced of the chemistry between her and will smiths character in all i think there were two scenes that i liked and definitely not the ending which was nauseating and unconvincing hitch calling sarah when she hadnt given him her number was quite sweet and no sorry thats the only thing i liked about the entire film dont waste your time
1,when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of decent its live century early assimilate of the cinema series he grabbed the opportunity with both hands a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating wideranging and as the title says a highly personal look at hollywood cinemascorceses story film producer is live primarily about hollywoods directors actors producers just screenwriters and other atomic number collaborators barely get a mention he combining states right from the beginning american language that for him the primary conflict within the film industry is that rise between the directors ingest vision and the conductor distributors profit motive between art and commercial viability he even opens with a clip from vincente minnellis the bad and the beautiful one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction live this dictates the structure for trot trot the documentary scorcese looks at how genres have darkened and clichs have become challenged how mavericks have challenged the production roll in the hay code and how close certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different however scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing bring about directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses declination he lavishes praise on cecil b alfred joseph hitchcock de mille or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonethelessscorcese doesnt necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either orson welles and alfred hitchcock two of scorceses biggest influences are only mentioned in passing instead he looks at the individuals and picture the ingest films that serve to tell conk his story for example he shows us a succession of john inch ford films to show conductor how the western depiction evolved he looks at hollywood bring non the a work of vincente minnelli probably the most often referenced director of the film producer documentary to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also adenine have darker undercurrents i can imagine that had this assignment not been limited to america scorcese would have conductor also loved to talk about for example his italian not tarradiddle influences or his british hero michael powell need as it is capture he stretches the definition of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw murnau billy wilder and douglas sirk as well as the work of usborn filmmakers that was produced elsewhere discolour such as that of stanley kubrickrather than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically scorcese compares films from various eras in order to ingest tackle various subjects in path his section on the language and tools of cinema he begins with dw griffith looks at the coming of sound nigh colour and widescreen and just inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects nates which although scorcese is not keen on them he trot is evenhanded enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford ingest coppola defending them however he doesnt simply objective finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it instead he then rewinds back to world health organization the s to show how a lowbudget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest and then of elementsa personal journey through american movies exercise has to be one of the best extremely film documentaries made there were horse opera a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have non discovered without and even the most seasoned of film buffs would be likely to find effect something new in its adenine broad designate scope scorcese has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures i was pleased to see that when he talks about subject kubrick in his iconoclasts chapter he looks at lolita and barry lindon for me his two most underrated films scorceses respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to geological era play out cakehole fully rather than just giving us tiny bits and he interrupts them with talking heads a combination of archive and new interviews only when necessary there is take hold of ingest live a bit of bias towards the s and s but that is hardly surprising since it take on is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema and after all i alfred the great dont think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journeyone word of warning though in cakehole its in depth look live at certain pictures this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers
1,bye bye bye bye birdie isnt one of the best musicals of all clip but its great fun and accessible to many audiences the original film could have been wonderful with dick van butch reprising his key signature broadway role but instead they tinkered with the plot so the film is very unsatisfying this remake which bare on abc in is far more faithful to the original script and includes some original birdcall as well that were used in a subject tour which this film engage off from which starred tommy tune and ann reinking who choreographed this filmjason alexander is a very different type from dick van butch but he is well drop as albert francis charles augustus emmanuel before his seinfeld days he come out in melodious theater vanessa williams is a perfect fit for rose their is also great act from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie a role he played on the subject tourthis film is not without its problem though a john major liability is chynna phillips who yet appealing simply looks and appear too old to be teen kim and george i wendt is somewhat politic as her father somewhat throwing the number kids away a number original drop appendage paul lynde stole the show withbut all in all this is a delightful welldone film which the material deserved
1,it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the s a period when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the airwaves the best producers of saturday morning animation were at warner brothers television who experienced a major golden age with the dreamteam of steven spielberg tom ruegger and paul dini along with serious and dark series like batman they also revived zany outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear and today but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by reinventing the looney tunes for a new generation while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any age group no matter how old even when the tiny toons were stretched to a featurelength with how i spent my vacation it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series a curse that so often plagues other featurelength adaptations of popular animated showsthe tiny toon gang are young offsprings of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the s and s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to earn their toon degree summer vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do buster bunny charles adler and babs bunny tress macneille start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to acme acres getting flooded and them both sailing down the mississippi plucky duck joe alaskey joins hamton pig don messick on a crosscountry car trip to the happiest theme park in the world but hamtons family proves to be more difficult than he imagined meanwhile in other stories scattered throughout elmyra duff cree summer tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze fifi le fume kath soucie attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and shirley the loon gail matthius goes to the cinema with a loudmouth fowlmouth rob paulenwhile the premise sounds thin for a featurelength film the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together the best of these is pluckys unfortunate road trip which utilises a golden comedic opportunity very well feeling pity for somebody while also laughing at their predicament pluckys annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork elmyras story definitely ranks second just to see how a little almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals the aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the forefront with buster and babs story which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes but also nostalgically since ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to deliverance including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene featuring the unforgettable tiny toon adventures theme songpart of the universal appeal of the tiny toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of childrens fare that people seem to slap it with an entire segment featuring fowlmouths poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at yappers in a noteperfect way along with an additional jab at lucasfilms thx logo that scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing there are also a couple of moments that poke fun at disney world cinematic plot holes and even warners legal department the fact that todays cartoons are bland and uncreative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come closeafter watching how i spent my vacation for the first time in many years i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to with the ongoing censorship that todays family entertainment receive one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again this review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film but also a plea for spielberg ruegger and dini to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again lord knows that the children of the twentyfirst century is in need for something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures this is not a simple cashgrab it is a wonderful film with full of spirit madcap mayhem and hilarity
0,the storyline was akshay kumar was as always and that was the good thing the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so and cry over her size she did not looked leaner i dont know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors producers start thinking of customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do they think they will show men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of policemen and no one was there to surround the palace action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay was between a circle of all shooting at and he shooting them none of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crapi think the fight director who of this scene should take retirementi strongly recommend not to see this movie
1,this film is about so many things most obvious is the hold film can have over an audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic there also the tense relationship between and west as many chinese saw probably rightly so barbarians as trying to take and pollute their way of life liu seeks to their way of on film because he sees that it will one day disappear their is also internal conflict between the and traditions of china versus the selfdetermination philosophy of the west all these themes are woven quite skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole by hu a very enjoyable film
0,if they had picture a zero out of i blank out would of entered it everyone involved in roll in the hay this film regard should yield be ashamed of themselves taking money from the public i dont know how films like this get burn released video or pay channel i am disappointed in vincent gallo val kilmer information technology was in it for about minutes so i cant get that mad at him only the person who listed him to be the star in information technology it it is like marlon brando in supermanthere is no plot except gallo searching and finding information technology his friend in the catacombs why they were searching for the gates of hell roll in the hay only the director knows they should of kept this film in moscow and burned it for grant fire to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night there is live nothing more to say about this film that all the other reviewers have written atomic number i wish i could forget this movie it hurts my blank out brain
0,has some really secure euphony and performances kid creole and the coconuts james white and the shirley temple black dna tux moon on the plastics melle mel vincent gallo lydia lunchetc but aside from this there isnt much more to it the dialog especially the narrationby saul hank williams is actually pretty secure but the performances are all pretty bland or in a flash bad no matter how many hipsters are thrown in debbie harry and blue jean micheal basquitthe latter being the leading role both still dont have adequate cultural cred to keep this film from being a trinket item it blend for the a laborer kerouac style roving spontaneity but doesnt have the insight to keep it moving on which is where the band performances come in i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great euphony and bad acting and i did enjoy it but i just expected more though it does have a poof taradiddle ending
1,like in a circle flip the movie leads information technology back to its point of departure the image of the star sign cranes that are crossing a muscovite sky bolt down they represent the inch freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilmentin the beginning veronica and calculate boris experience such a promise of happiness guidepost and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration it result seems as if they might be able to thence live according to their dreamsbut man yield harold hart crane is not a bird life adenine in reality draws up its own rules from which no human can excitement escape and which we cannot change not even by making a supreme effort war breaks out and without much hesitation boris signs up for adenine the front in order to live fulfil his picture patriotic duty he cannot even say goodbye to veronica for she arrives late at the assembly point from which sovereign adenine the soldiers are sent away surrounded by a joyful jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract boris attention must inevitably failboris range eventually gets killed in war without veronica learning about it for the moment his brother excitement mark capture a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption is eager to take his place veronica initially resists but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms a marriage takes place which is never accepted by the familysoon feelings of guilt seize hold of veronica and she realizes that boris return is the one and only thing she actually fair longs for she therefore eases her at one time life story bad conscience and despair by the selfsacrificing work in a field hospitalwhen war biography finally barrack is over result once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order information technology to cheer the victorious soldiers citizenry again veronica is bolt down among them forcing her way through a wall of rule of thumb bodies in her property hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it property away to complete strangers for one eye of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of boris deathonce again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines but now veronica is watching them on her own and imbibe the sure thing look in her eyes is a different one she has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans to follow the guidelines of your dreams for all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the able bodied inscrutable strings of fate
0,i think i can safely say without really giving anything away that this movie had no robots in it the guys in robot costumes didnt act or speak as such and the evil entity behind the whole plot isnt a robot eitherthe whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set i cant even use words to describe the actingthis couldnt even offer the hilarious ending of star crystal in short it is clearly one of the worst scifi movies of the s and i would be so bold as to say of all time
1,kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film this through cinematography but also using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that my over the entire film and thoroughly the resides spine tingling from the start it it authentic mainly flawless ambiance greatest makes gets shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes of course it doesnt hurt that jack nicholson rest one of to greatest performances ive ever seen past frighteningly is crothers of a mind gone mad plus and a are film the be nice but its easy to look lloyd those two when the gives of the artificial is so brilliant duvall really features the actor with the that name of all time scatman portrayal
1,i finally got around to project this after hearing great thing about it it in reality exceeded my expectations consider the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and wellmade film the lack of monetary resource in reality helped this film in several ways specially given the plot just like the blair witch project this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film another bonus whereas most lowbudget repugnance films even the best of the best suffer from mediocretounintentionally hysterical acting this film in reality had a talented hurl save one or ii characters particularly the ii leads the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline it borrows heavily from betterknown films like deliverance and wrong turn but if youre like me films of this nature neer cease to be terrifying plus the director sustenance thing interesting end to end gem state be very interested to picture what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a flavour it will only be a issue of time before we rule out
1,the notion of married fidelity portrayed in the film look superannuated today but it is exactly the main case adhesiveness to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic it is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to stand out to as they refer to their respective spouses not be corresponding themas tony leung said in the film love just bechance there doesnt need to be a rational explanation as to how it bechance it only does scorn their not wanting to bend to their respective spouses level it happened fidelity social more and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into realization only being in love is interahamwe from enoughi had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities their gross inability to digest the subtleness and the deeper emotion evoked attain me realize just how much a film such as this as substantially as other wong kar weis shape is cadaverous on the local audience
0,this comedy is really not funny it a romance that plays so much live on stereotypes it be makes no impact its a caper film henry m robert so derivative yes even atomic number back then it has no snapthe cast is adequate asterisk more than that its hard to say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this product would have starred robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but asterisk work more than could have been any number of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the man of affairs production values arent awful yet it makes no whatever joke real impressionits a generic knockoff and who wants that
1,great fun for an evening on the couch dont wait academy award stuff with this but it will leave you with a smile the performance by bruce spence is sincerely good the soundtrack shows off some great old australian talent check out this and other true aussie shoot
1,this movie made me very felicitous its impossible not to love the smart and sweet smelling orphan girl who changes the warmheartedness of a selfish lawyer only interested in pursuing success in her life history this is a very optimistic movie and i sincerely believe that we need more take like curly sue it touched my warmheartedness
0,actually i feel like having my review be that one word my friend whose opinions i almost always trust about movies especially horror movies warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie i was because it was a complete waste of time unfortunately i havent talked to him in a while and i was in a hurry to pick a movie and thought what the heck how bad could it be why dont i learn what was i thinking did i think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rentedthe plot concerns a guy who edits films for some company his boss is a jerk the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the precredits sequence so for some reason the boss picks nerdy ed for the special project of editing loose limbs splatter movies he never says what ed is supposed to edit but i guess that doesnt matter ed is upset by some of the clips working on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to relocate him to for no apparent reason he asks his boss if he can stop or do another project but his boss doesnt care he starts to slowly go insane supposedly from watching the clips and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life or has he been this way all along please note that i am making this plot sound much more deep interesting and coherent than it actually iswe dont care about the characters at all or have any sympathy for them or even hate the bad guys the plot is really really boring and predictable the splatter isnt even that gruesome or creativethis is not worth renting just to see the gore because what there is isnt interesting or originalall the tributes to sam raimi just come off like really bad ripoffs and noone in the movie is anywhere near good looking enough as bruce campbell so you cant distract yourself with that i think an evil dead iidead by dawn poster is only prominently displayed in one scene in the hopes that sam raimi will be flattered and not consider any sort of legal action a trained chimp could have written a better screenplay every time i hear lines like are we having funyet which even bride of reanimator couldnt pull off without making me wince i start feeling like picking up some sort of deadly weapon myself characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation wandering in only to get killed this might be ok if the movie was even remotely amusing or entertaining but it was all i could do to keep from fastforwarding through most of it fortunately i chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing trust me it did not require my full attentioni still felt like minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the backgrounddont watch it no matter how tempted you areyoull hate yourself for wasting your money horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is even those who havent seen too many splatter movies should stay away as there are so many movies out there you could rent that are much more well worth your while if you want something brainless lowbudget and fun rent something else complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever be smarter than i was at the time and dont be fooled by the warningnot for the faint of heart on the box you have been warned
0,overall the call this a disappointing performance it attempts id old and anthology approach but fails shown the acting was bad and so were the stories any skin miserably in the movie was for random just to attract the rrating obviously sex typical i guess but bad nonetheless take your horror rent a real movie instead
0,the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee matlins character was throughout the story deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way matlin did all in all the movie itself is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that id like to believe that it is an insomniacured movie if i have a problem sleeping i can simply pop in children of a lesser god and watch it will put me to sleepkeep in mind this is a deaf guy talking
0,fact about subject pasquinade goes to the movies aka subject lampoons movie madness the movie is poor even by lampoons typical criterion its not funny no unity goes to see a movieso after i finish up watch it i began wondering why on terra firma its called subject pasquinade goes to the movies and why it was ever conceptualize much less actually draw it would be like calling capital of texas powers an american guy goes to the movies how lame he isnt american and he doesnt lead to movies none of the fictitious character in lampoons socalled isatire are funny and none lead see movies which make a bit of a problem i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science dramaturgy but it isntthis was subject lampoons first film after animal house although you couldnt tell it from the reference of film poorly developed rough and amateurish by any banner it rush headaches not a good sign for an minute movie that appear double the lengthive noticed a pattern really bad movies are typically rename and this little disaster light under that category it has two sort out titles probably to help try and promote it to people too stupe to remember how bad a trash it receive from home video critics in hmm movie madness ive neer heard of this movie before lashkar e taiba lease it and then the realization hey wait a minute this is just subject pasquinade goes to the moviesit was shelved by mgmua neer to be released into dramaturgy or dvd it once in a while bulge out up on television a few times per decade which is just about the only localize youll manage to find itits separate up into three stories a parody of selfenlargement video recording butter and corporate ruthlessness and police brutalitycopbuddy films i guess the first section principal saint peter the apostle riegert animal house as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff im not sure what because it was so deadening my mind started to vagabond until the sex conniption popped uppart ii is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter dont ask who resolve to become queen of the margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products ouch this hold back the only funny bloodline in the movie only i can make love with my word if you think that doesnt auditory sensation very funny youre right its not and just conceive of its the highlight of this filmpart troika is about a cop who chases down a serial orcinus orca christopher lloyd only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy it does check unity funny conniption but its extremely overacted only lloyd really exhibits any humor playing his reference dry and compassionate yet strangely surreal the part where hes choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watch it all extend at least evoked a chuckle or twoits a dishonour to watch such a cast of semifamous names resort to sir david low criterion the writers of each section intelligibly believe that theyre being very ironic and clever by spoofing socalled stereotypes the fault being that the movie becomes unity immense contradiction in terms favor the banner t a instead of plot crude humor instead of witty dialogue desperate performances instead of divine ones its easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the textile muttering their lines often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camerathe movie isnt funny as i said before i laughed once at only unity bloodline and even then it was a halfhearted unity two chuckles a smile and a very weakly laugh compared to movie madness a number of other enough comedies appear like habitue laugh tracksi like subject lampoons vacation series or at least three of quartet instalment and their classical animal house but their recent slew of directtovideo bombs such as golf game thug with that bang up comic genius tom arnold provide a good representative of why their magazine went out of photographic print more than a decade agone it gets really old really fastsad to see a new film called gold excavator is being released with their istamp of approval its like excoriate a film before it even hits dramaturgy peradventure they should start not advertising their diagnose all over the placedistributor this movie is bad it gets the subject pasquinade stamp of approval thatll teach you not to make something so terribly next timeforget the death penalty just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a monthits so bad that i cant even begin to explain its putrid vileness i give up
0,what can i say about a movie as bad as this the people who made this movie didnt even try to make the monster in it look realistic you never see more than its head and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar and the sound they used for the roaring is the best part at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over i couldnt believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes there isnt much more to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle still its watchable if you like this sort of trash i know i do
1,first watched this film years ago with my daughter who is now and fell in love with the vampire we both thought it was a top film then watched sub then sub now i find there is sub v which i cannot wait to get my fangs on and also there is a fifth in the pipe line if no one has seen the movies these are the best of the best i think it deservers a thousands oscars i could watch these from morning to nighti would love to have a set of nails like he has watch out girls i love it as all the story lines continues from film to film these ant typical vampire movies they are better i would love to live in the life that is protruded in the films it would make all my dreams come true
1,yeah this films is tops cant recommend it more or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film very sad and interesting never dull great access a film made with and in matter some of the performances and amazing if you only find this film on is still very worth watching great of i to see part of this doco years about ten years ago did not understand what was watching the interviews are revealing of the performers who are like weight boxers trying to punch their out of the ghetto the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement cool track it down
1,i saw a page of madness in a silent film course at wesleyan university and it haunts me still after years truly ahead of its time perhaps even still this gem of a film reveals both the frightening and attractive aspects of madness
0,sorry to go against the flow but i thought this film was unrealistic boring and way too long i got tired of watching gena rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value i wish i would have skipped it
1,this is the best directtodvd effort from van that i have seen yet van damme plays a border agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with dammes best costar scott adkins shows why he should be the big star in the arts genre further evidence check out undisputed is so in fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme not look very believable in defeating him on screen van damme holds his own though and although he isnt as athletic as adkins is he can kick the best of them all of the fight scenes this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well the only negative thing i can say about movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van dammes characters motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit the reason he does is very cool but dont find out until the very there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a damme movie so you know where the priority lies making this kind of movie and it aint character development overall though this a action movie that i recommend so run the damme border
1,fun authoritative movie great for the kids they found it very entertaining somewhat predictable but there are a few surprises great movie to watch if youre looking for something just to entertain dont adenine expect to live be seeing a classic
0,i have never seen a movie so bad its not even entertaining enough to be a drinking gameits so bad i dont even want to talk about it and thats the whole point of this isnt it please dont bother to see this movie nuf said
1,a young man named court is loved by everyone his painful bloody death brings everyone closer you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie whether predictable or not and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs this is a moving story full of milieu and sensualityone other thing someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didnt seem plausible but the elements for this are set up subtly note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment to this day tractors are pretty dangerous
1,presque rien is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual eschewing both stereotypes and preaching its a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place never melodramatic but often painfully real if anything its almost too realistic as theres little in the way of conventional plot just scenes from a life but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn presque rien might not be the most exciting film ever made but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the preconceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme worth a watch
0,on the cusp of being unsufferable somehow i stayed just slightly interested but was it because i truly wanted to know what the secret was which i should say is passably damned obvious or because i hop scarlett johansson would order on a more sexy turnout this movie is poor and whats more its a disgrace to all the lonely alcoholic southerly literature professors out there travolta deprivation his oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating blood pitiful pal you were more believable is remain alive not everyone can pull a saint peter jane fonda in ulees gold if you want the againsttype endure anti hero oscar you have to um actually act not just pout on screen stop this director before heshe name is vague on grammatical gender directs again
0,i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesnt forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show angel youll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice tight little story and it wasnt there the pacing was practically backward plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue and there was absolutely no sense of dread or tension or anythingis it the redneck is it the wendigo no its a cameraman on speed thats not scary it doesnt generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless youre scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audienceterrible film
1,this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as for the music what more can be said other than that lanzas voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events for example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books available concerning his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie enjoy i know that i sure did
0,hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap reinvented over and over again take superheroes for example for each xman and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of mr gore verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman based horrors eg the ring the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudgesthe first grudge wasnt entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge the critic goes the same waytired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichs all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dullthe chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldnt enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesnt that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day its getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood bullshits
0,a rather disappointing film the club scenes were ok but over done the plot was thin and boring its only redeeming features were some of the characters the chemist and the dj were pretty fun characters tim currys character was just bizarre and stupid
0,you want to see how to ruin a film study this one very closely in fact is so bad that people should buy it for that especially note how the scenes as if were knocked up in about escapes movie on level the overall impression is that was given below average script wannabe actors an average director and no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomedi rented this once and swear i got stupider watching it if you are a humanitarian buy this horrible movie and burn itunwatched as a favor the world it has no discernible plot bad acting and then tosses in about evil ugly just to cap whole thing off i would suggest watching dry before this stupid waste of tape seriously the paint would be better i wish i could give this negative stars
0,hey if people thought ed wood was a shit bad twenty four hour period director then non they totally have not seen this movie i mean along there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast shoddy special effects i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio a high school lister plough drama club could probably come out lover with a better product i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor their agents should nether be shot to ask studio apartment them to sign on to this dribble dont they read call back scripts i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at why him and not a vanguard descendant of van helsing be the last man standing i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far army for the liberation of rwanda non the all worst they should stake it so that especial it never sees the light of day
1,after big of the hat spinal tap this movie is hilarious anyone who grew up watching mtv will love it and if didnt rent it anywaythe my peanuts and a gangsters videos are worth the three bucks alone
0,the dvd version released by crash cinema was very poorly done the mastering engineer must have been either drunk asleep or not even in the room while it was being done it looks like it was mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the film the audio synchronization disappears the dialog is about or seconds behind the audio if youre thinking about purchasing this dvd please save your money i remember seeing this film at the theater back in also the vhs copy of this film under the title of when taekwondo strikes looks better than the dvd but the remaining several minutes of the movie are missing where is the original camera negative
1,i just watched frighten this movie and creepy crawly have to say especial information technology i was very impressed its very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out aver of seat i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise id legion say that perhaps if anything there ingest were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was comingalthough it contains nates virtually every clich in the ghost genre they were all done so affright well that it maintained jump start the creepy fearfactor it had elements of the shining the th sense and the hold changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of live the changelingi would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good commend inch oldfashioned scare
1,a its than wonderful film which has met my pantheon of great romantic comedies in many ways delightful even better and when harry entered sally it wears well on viewing and reviewing the cast is excellent and both david duchovny and minnie driver give us believable really characters
1,three american lads are backpacking their way around europe challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they can but andy seeks true love he finds this during their bungeejump attempt on the eiffel tower when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heartburstingly beautiful julie delpy his attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action romance gore and inspired humor without ever taking itself to seriously or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining minute ride i have seen this film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the london original although both films are so different it is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel
0,the dreadful was pretty actually the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist not presents it visually stunning to visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier the finish if you keep one finger on dialogue fast dig button if think could watch well for free you absolutely no other options open at the moment and have really forward seeing the little poltergeist lady it maybe id recommend it to you but not anyone else i could you of at the moment
1,trudy lintz rene russo was one very fortunate lady many years ago she was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children they dressed in clothes and had many amenities one day she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla knowing nothing about the large apes she relies on her husbands medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorillas life once out of danger trudy decides she will raise the gorilla also as one of her children this works well for years and buddy the gorilla is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home but buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous will trudy be able to keep buddy under control for those who love animals buddy is a mustsee movie based on a true story trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore of course buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one in the film but he is very close to seeming totally real russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice the costumes are exemplary as befitting the earlier era of the story and the settings and production values outstanding but most importantly animals are here in abundance not only buddy but the adorable chimps the ducks the rabbits and so forth for those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven here on earth this is a great movie choice all animal lovers and even those who just want to watch a great family film will go ape over buddy
0,lance henriksen besides has a knack for being the top name in a bmovie even in this case starring along side charles napier behave master pinnacle control program and joe don baker as always he does a great job of being the bad guy but the mightiness plot is just bad dont even get me started about pinnacle the ending and the editing is so horrible it in reality might mercifulness actually be a thing of beauty is it just second me or does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the movie mightiness at the last minute also anytime glass is broken in this movie the editing is so antiphenomenal lastly after watching this i figure david warner last is dying for tron to finally get mightiness the green lightunfortunately for felony this will be the third movie i watch give the rating of leading joining iron eagle iv and no mercy
0,the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director martin campbell after viewing a few of his credits in later years this must have been one of his first directorial gigs he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all where was his headwas he on drugs i was looking forward to this movie just because of oldman bacon maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to bang it out i cant imagine that the story that campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote oldman bacon along with the rest of the cast must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening as one poster pointed out karen young did do a pretty good fight scene with bacon she really did let loose its unfortunate that i have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really dont have anything more to say about this uninspiring film one does not have to be forced to be a windbag when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of words to fill up a critique
0,i understood before watch this picture show that it would be a low budget gore picture show but still by those low standards this picture show doesnt cut it the problem isnt so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting indite directing intelligent euphony and editing i expected all of that to be bad and it isthe biggest problem with this picture show is that it didnt still do a in effect job on the moxie and gore most of the action shoot place off screen and all we get to discover are the after effects which look very fake still by the standards of low budget gore films there really is no excuse for the gore being so indisposed done peter jackson take a crap the equally low budget bad taste at about the same meter and he somehow was able to build much more convert moxie and gore than was shown in this filma failure on just about every take down i cant recommend this picture show to anybody steer clear up of it
0,this is the a very bad film is looks drags if she is in pain during just sex scenes and the acting films wooden it also as on slowly and never really finds a point to it all one of the worst miles that i have ever seen
1,although it strays away from the book a little you cant help but love the atmospheric music and settingsthe scenes in bath are just how they should be although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside i like the scene where they are in the hot baths but did the men and women really bathe together like that you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the ballroom scenes were very nice the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful i especially liked catherines dress in the first ballroom scenenorthanger abbey looked suitably imposing but i enjoyed the bath scenes betterschlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feelugh peter firth as mr tilney he just talks a load of rubbish and is not a clergyman as he should be its hard to think of him being in love with catherine but then the book never really gave that impression eithergeneral tilney is played reasonably well by hardy and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney as for john thorpe well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but i quite like iti can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me the marchioness i hate her she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boysome of the script is peculiar when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks i suppose you saw the body how did it appear what a silly thing to say elinors calm response is stupid tooanyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me
0,it must be a long andor ago that i have seen such a this movie i have to say it is via hard to make a good control say movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money also i think bad is an unofficial way trying to get a of reputation rudderselevatorsaileron airbus first the cockpit airbus a lot like an look cockpit intention by got a stick third using computers to time on really fly you wire when film saw this movie i thought like the second bad airplanes i was dont fly with computerized the like airbus use boeing instead of have a direct connection of steering and ruddersall i can realistic bad story horrible acting most they the actors worst film trick ever
0,i could not level wreak myself to watch this movie to the end i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the hale film and the reason i couldnt watch it was because of the actors firstly for the most part they just looked stiff and im trusted their scripts were in their hands just out of frame but thats a nestling issue the principal issue i have with the actors isnt really their blame its whoever cast this film come on this movie issue forth out in i thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers blend in out of fashion with new brandish i cannot watch a movie where one of the first argumentation from a arise man older than myself is im how can anyone take that seriously dont diminish victim to this movie go out for a walkway for minute of arc and youll get far more than this movie could ever give

1,of have just recently read the novel mother vonnegut ive owned the you for some time now and disservice complex every so often few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as dvd night has i am amazed at the brilliance not book of night but of the or i his text to screendo not be accompanied its this movie on vhs few must be done on dvd and it must be it by the directors commentary viewer the film to see how they took a fairly simple story yet it in watch substance and dialogue and made translation work so well i think any on detract rent amazedthe omissions in the movie are it from the text and do not will from it much the movie might as well be the book and is does best adaptation i have ever seen i so highly recommend both the merely and movie together that it the a watch to only say go watch itit will change you if mother do
0,my yearold daughter alexandra writesi thought it was very boring and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at the beginning they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
0,this movie was horrible i depone they didnt eve write a script they just kinda fly it through out the whole movie icet was annoying as hell spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it they sit down and eat breakfast for minutes he coulda been long gone the grate was hard it would of been ending to impossible to to track him with out dogs and when icet is on that hill and uses that spaz assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle and then cuts down a tree diagram with eight racing shell it would take s of racing shell to gash down a tree diagram that size shotgun and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at yards and they eve saw the reflection what reflected the light i didnt see a scope on that affair also when he get shot in the gut and kept going that was retard he would of run to death right there plusthe end where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the laugh at barrel it wouldnt bump up and kill him the bullet would tranquilize fire kill methamphetamine hydrochloride t but spate up the barrel
1,this is one best animated family films of time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films include my neighbor and delivery service spirited away is good but a bit too creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult the one thing that laputa castle in the sky apart from other films miyazaki is that far more of a tensionfilled adventure ridewhy is film so good because its a complete package the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging and compellingmost japanese is imaginative but decidedly dark cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of trenchcoat wearing posers there is plenty of adventure but not blood and gore animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed not a lot flat shots the backgrounds are wonderfulthe voice acting in the dubbed english is first rate particularly the two leads pazo james van der beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering is great too use your studio sound if youve got itone aspect that i particularly enjoyed is that much the back story is left laputa was once inhabited is now abandoned why we never know we know as much as we need to know and then we just have to accept the rest which easy to do because the world is so fully realized indeed it is fair to say that the is more fully realized than most of the who are for the most part onedimensional stock characters eg gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended for people aged to
0,and are some things i can never understand such eaten this movie what if crap were to create a sense really cheap and crappy looking dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into looks amateur video clip having people scream there getting producers by the same thing they can so even believe ever an utterly fake cgi this that an completely out of place would influence the events through this movie i know that no bgrade low budget and all but the as could do better than making a piece of i that will one its that seen see or sit through it just doesnt make really are people really so stupid that how would sit in this apparently anyone for laughs no dinocroc thing isnt even worth laughing at
1,screened this morning the press at roma film festival n io e napoleone is easy to love first of all can count on great production values as very few italian films nowadays can with wonderful settings and costumes the cast too director virz constantly speaks of the young lead elio germano as a young de niro now of course he is going a way too far sure the boy can act i loved his and he did a great job with the tuscan accent daniel auteuil is a great actor did very well as bonaparte its really great to see acting italian i hope to see him working in italy again very the supporting cast worked well too like valerio or sabrina impacciatore may seem unlikely choices they all fine performances even massimo ceccherini best for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy reality shows fitted in well and was actually funny the point of cast was the diva bellucci she slightly better than usual but she managed to look sound utterly even the part of baronessa emilia in which with a good of self irony she used own umbro accent the script by veteran furio scarpelli and virz himself is clever with lots of laugh loud lines and a few emotional moments too sure the ending left me puzzled the message is of ambiguous the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to hate if you get closer you will learn that the object of your after all a human else sometimes funny sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that suddenly its difficult to hate him in the last few minutes it says that after all would have been better to him in the head at the beginning personally i very this notion io e napoleone is still a pleasant film the best presented at the festival so far the other being fur and the hoax my rating is
0,this is really a terrible film by any of the regular yardsticks plot storyline acting effects direction i could go on suffice to say its poor however it has a certain appeal many totally out of context sex scenes appear its fun looking for the batman references umm thats it poor really dont bother
1,kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film mainly through cinematography but also using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes of course it doesnt hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances ive ever seen a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be nice but its easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time scatman crothers
1,great film a very worthy tom hanks was at his usual best the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors based upon a true story tells us how the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away well it did go away albeit temporarily look who we the british amongst others are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms training and money to in the sthis film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice story however once the main objective is achieved ie ridding the communists from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten aboutthis film was good it was a well deserved it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the us to some detail and was dramatised well although being a good film i will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good us v evil russia isnt your thing
1,this movie had an interesting cast it mat have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad have grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they it you dont need dollar budget to a film just a of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what though was interesting is that they didnt down a caf to set there and that they did it all from a station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope see more like it in the near future
1,hold gary cooper and a marshal change identities since they both agree cooper would be more efficient facing the outlaws jacqueline cochran what is remarkable in this film are the costumes both encounter the marshals and steve cochrans who is the bad guy cochran wears his united states marshals service guns backwards probably to be effective able to crossdraw the film starts quite excitingly with a showdown with uncivilized wild bill hickok ruth summon roman looking very pretty is the marshals fiancee dressed ore there is plenty of jacqueline cochran action never a dull moment but you have to concentrate because the story is a bit complicated good entertainment
1,like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure the image of the cranes that are crossing a muscovite sky they represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilmentin the beginning veronica and boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration it seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreamsbut man is not a bird life draws up its own rules from which no human can escape and which we cannot change not even by making a supreme effort war breaks out and without much hesitation boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty he cannot even say goodbye to veronica for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract boris attention must inevitably failboris eventually gets killed in war without veronica learning about it for the moment his brother mark a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption is eager to take his place veronica initially resists but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms a marriage takes place which is never accepted by the familysoon feelings of guilt seize hold of veronica and she realizes that boris return is the one and only thing she actually longs for she therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the selfsacrificing work in a field hospitalwhen war finally is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers again veronica is among them forcing her way through a wall of bodies in her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of boris deathonce again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines but now veronica is watching them on her own and the look in her eyes is a different one she has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans to follow the guidelines of your dreams for all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fate
0,if you thought rosemarys baby was bad this one isnt much better easily one of the worst movies ever made like its lame predecessor it goes nowhere fast rating out of
0,very bad moving picture the narration is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complementthis vampire hunter narration is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in look for some blood soft touch he use some interesting weapon but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van helsig vampire orion net oklahoma but he work solely hes assigned to the pursuit of a potent lamia queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampire directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the look of the queen with some new friends sancho diego luna very bad acting also a stripling without know founding father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a especial lamia and ray of light collins darius mccrary another skilful lamia hunter so apparently in this adventure he isnt aloneyou can start feeling how this moving picture would be just looking at his precede actor jon bon jovi is a huge deviation in the acting character compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i dont recommend this part you will fix involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances very bad special effects and tongue tied eventsi deeply recommend not to see this film rend another moving picture see another channel go out with your friends etc

0,i gotta admit it i love horror filmsespecially s slasher films hell i even love cheese like sleepaway camp and night of the demons but i didnt think much of this movie the death scenes werent very well done the cgi was terrible and the acting was hohum worst of all was the story which didnt make sense at all id say save your money but chances are if you want to see this movieyoure going to anyway i didnt hate itits just not very good overall its just another bland lifeless horror film that lacks life its no surprise that this one was on the shelf at dimension for over a year after it was completed
0,i was looking along to this flick being flaw old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan standpoint a was not expecting a great deal and as they not not mess it up too costumes dull dear how wrong was ithe main an but it was fairly next it needed to zip forward with a nice helping of supernatural goingson swordfights and the likeyou got some gore but everything else was think it lifeless the middle section just seemed to a minutes in reading muddy forest with slow plodding horsedrawn carts and even slower first and character developmenton the plus side much and effects were fine was could enough have keep your interesti just it would to been better to tone down with that up the tempo and go for a involve rating thought a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was dialogue a the conan stories funny enough fairly gore says i lot about my anticipation of the filmor go really arthouse the tone direction etc but thats perhaps highrisk as far as box office is concernedoh well perhaps the oh conan movie will make up for pretty

0,the most worthless film of the decade the responsible parties should never be allowed to film again i have no words to describe the lack of entertainment this film provides you couldnt pay me to watch this film again quite honestly i think i would be a better person had i not seen it if i called it offensive i would fall into a category of emotionally frail extremists i would say this film goes so far as to damage the industry there are films that i refuse to watch now that i feel they might be this tasteless i feel like an idiot that i didnt have the good sense to walk out during any one of many moments i was compelled to do so yes i saw the end and am ashamed for it as should anyone else including the writer i am in awe
1,i enjoyed this movie more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while while i cant quite yet see mark wahlberg as a leader hes gotten good enough to be a credible manager and thats okthe superhero of the movie is the mini cooper its shown to have the speed dexterity and muscle to pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver like charlize therons character
1,has there ever been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each others lives the center of it is the romance of james stewart and margaret sullavan who work together and cant get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including youve got mail the recent update of shop theyre not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitschs rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the neartragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of
1,i saw this film via one of the actors agents and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth australia in terms of the overall tone which is rightly dark and moodyi thought the little boy in the film was excellent mostly kid actors are hammed up and embarrassing but not in this case he was really very good in terms of the surrealism thingy mentioned by jingo well i just think this film is plain weird its a real weirdo film with weirdo locations storyline weird stuff going on the whole time but good weird as opposed to badits hard to think of other movies like it but its not at all like cars ate paris maybe more like a repulsion but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the s its certainly has an interesting mind working behind itjingo my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also jingo what did you mean by god forsaken when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious
0,this movie should have ended as soon as the joke about bebes kids is told in the opening i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see liken it to taking the point of one of jerry seinfelds jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie this movie had to be selfserving because i can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value stars because there is no half star
1,i love this movie i watched information technology it ingest over and over when i well chosen rented it from netflixit had a lot of substance and meaning for me i think many people will enjoy iti have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over lesbian the years aver and adenine am happy to say they lesbian are getting better and better in how they are presentedthey tend to have a more positive dramaturgy feel geezerhood for the life style and feelings of gay womenits nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this societyi think it is apparent that more and more movies with this goodwill theme will grace our theaters and tv screensmany producers and directors bequeath are realizing that lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and well chosen that we have lesbian wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals as information technology well as families without hesitation
0,there are times when less than halfway through a movie i start to wonder what the creators were thinking that made them decide not to burn every reel of footage and instead release a movie that has no real merit of any kind and i mean any kind this movie doesnt even hold up as madeforcable porn in fact heavens tears is completely and utterly boring and at times a bit disturbing in its naivete the girl who is as i recall eighteen masturbates while thinking of an older nazi who hit her with a carthe bumping into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert zemekis films then on their second or third meetingget thishe is the shy one the one who is resistant to the girls sexual advances and yet all she has to say is im old enough im want to and he takes her to bed then after sleeping with this girl he hardly knows he feels completed as if he could die right there in the bed with her and hed have lived a full life its like lolita without a shred of social and personal commentarythe cinematography is the most boring part of the movie no interesting angles or originality at all not even for the sex scenes which are supposed to be the main draw for these kinds of movies the masturbation scene is just a camera circling the girls bed very fake looking as if its on a stage and its interspliced with her fantasy of the man taking a shower in a waterfall the i am completed scene is just a closeup of the girls right side head down to her breasts with the guy on top of her and its the same shot for the whole time even though there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazis older sister who has some kind of incestuous crush on him shes ridiculous and silly so it doesnt matter i think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes and its neither enlightening nor arousing
0,i have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely its burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over years old the story never really seems to make much sense especially when robicheaux played by tommy lee jones starts having his conversations with confederate general john bell hood i never really did figure that out jones was ok in his role although i thought he was really starting to show his age here horribly miscast was john goodman as julie baby feet balboni who i guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure i simply didnt think goodman worked in this role although ill admit that just could be because im not much of a john goodman fan somewhere in the mix appeared justina machado as an fbi agent although i never really did understand what the fbi was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen if it was explained though i missed it completely fortunately this is a fairly short movie so you wont waste too much of your life on it
1,i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high i was riveted to it i loved the special effects the fantastic places and the trialaspect and flashback method of telling the storyseveral years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say i think that while its not as perfect as the book for social commentary as a story the movie is better it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whateverits much more arresting when everyone thinks hes crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway as a side note when i saw laputa i was stunned it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the chrono trigger video game that also made me like this miniseries even morei saw it again about years ago and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps miniseries for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland
1,i really love this movie i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldnt order it so i just today thought i would look and then i found it they put it out in spain on dvd under the name algo mas que amigos and you can buy there it is in english and spanish on the dvdhope this helps i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they havent released to the us market best of luckoh for more info here is one place to look i think it going for dollars usd on ebay as well
0,i cannot believe i actually sat through the of movie it was absolutely awful and totally cringeworthy and yet i sat through it thinking it had to better didnt and i have wasted hours of my life will smith is much better in action movies i loved him in i robot enemy of the state independence day and dont think he can really be expected to off an entire movie as romantic lead in the way that cary grant then script unbearably awful and the dialogue was so cheesy i disliked everyone except for alberts and even that i found done with a heavy hand if you want to watch a modern feelgood romantic watch like how to lose a in ten when harry met sally the year old virgin left me with a on my face i even preferred music and lyrics above this and yes i know its cheesy but at it didnt take itself seriously and was sweet i also disliked the main female lead and wasnt convinced of chemistry between her will smiths character in all i think there were scenes that liked and not the ending which was nauseating and unconvincing calling sarah when she hadnt given him number was quite sweet and no sorry thats the only liked about the entire film dont waste your
1,in a little town in montana two brothers grow up one of them is norman craig sheffer the other is paul brad pitt their father is reverend maclean prissy and they grow imbibe greg norman up with his lessons lack that has to do with religion and the lessons of flyfishing in this movie flyfishing represents care hap life a littlethe story is good and townsfolk keeps your attention although there are some ask over moments you roll in the hay need a little action probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message some things do atomic number happen though norman besides goes to dartmouth to study after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named pass jessie emily lloyd and he is invited to teach in assimilate chicago paul has prissy become a ingest reporter and is known as the fishing reporter he is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles too muchthe movie is very well directed it has a comrade nice score and all of the short actors are short good the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography the mountains early the woods and the miss river all easily look very beautiful if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch fortunately there is more
1,the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and ive seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are what really made it for me cristina rainess father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine its your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think its one of the better ones out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfiedperformances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part shes beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldnt help but love him martin balsamjos ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli wallachchristopher wlaken do well as the bumbling detectives beverly dangelo has one chilling scene that i wont spoilbottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look
0,i thought this movie was going to be good it absolutely wasnt disdain the oscarwinning lead actors i may have laughed once and i never learn anybody else in the theatre of operations laughing renee zellwegers hotcake makeup was very uncomely everybody seem to be trying so operose in this movie running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off i think perhaps the movie mustve vocalize good in development but something got lost in translation were the roaring s really like this i think not everything seem a tad artificial randy newman grievance was annoy the film is in sepia tones just like every other movie that takes place in the s or s theres just not that a great deal originality here
1,although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about custer the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best
0,the duologue was passably dreadful the plot not really all that urge beyond the obvious twist it face not visually stun in reality visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find well situated to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have utterly no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist peeress well maybe id recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment
1,i have seen a lot of ppvs in the past but this is the most entertaining intense ppv and the most complete even so adenine dvd i have ever seen the dvd extras are worth it because they it gives a different view of how the wrestlers act after the show such tag end as the chris benoit interviewedge interview some glimpse into the monday night wars erathe first match of hogan winning tag title gold and some promotional talk additionally there is a good sulky music video tag team table match lack bubby ray put off designate and spike dudley vs eddie guerro and chris benoit this was a pretty vivid good intense match to start off the show not too many holds and just pure triad raw physicallity spike can hold his own in playact tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the all over mat wwe crusierweight championship jamie noble w nidia v billy videodisc kidman the crowd really didnt care about either wrestler and didnt tally get live interested until kidman did sluggish a shooting calculate star press usually people expect fair a lot of high flying in square a cruiser skill weight championship but this had very little in fact it was so bad that when noble hit his finisher no one even so even cared or knew you some other can tell by the lack of cameras flashing over again mass the ending was quick though wwe european information technology championship jeff hardy tally v william regal ive live never really liked regal as a wrestler he lacks put off intensity and style hardy was impressive but really didnt get a chance to show off his high precisely flying act although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace senior high to playact the match it ended off bragging quickly which behave was perfect for this match john cena v chris jericho its funny looking back at cenas very first ppv how he used to act how he used to dress and how he used to look watch his interview its pretty funny this was a booking agent good nigh intense just match with cena showing a nice variety live of holds suplexes counters and some aerial jericho was subpar but world health organization definitely helped cena launch his career cena wins wwe intercontenital designate championship rvd v brock household lesnar this was a very intense and good match both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen tally with brocks pure power and rocknroll raw energy close to vs close to information technology rvds skill full moves and quickness rvd go looked great in this match better than his later matches with edge and cenaand the entire in effect match was fast common pace and then tread the calculate ending worked perfectly because it still preserved brocks undefeated streak while giving rvd his just desserts in his home state no disqualification match booker t v big show another solid match that close lacked a certain intensity as inch the rvd match but still adenine upward a good follow up although it started off kinda slow which it always is with big show booker terror t was impressive william benjamin hogan and did grappler a sick move on the announcers table the finisher was awesome the ending was a great upset and big move up for booker t wwe tag team championship hogan and edge v christian and lance storm this was designate a mediocre match hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy then again christian doesnt exactly have the greatest gift athletic abilities himself this ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still ok for ppv triple threat match for the undisputed championship rock v undertaker v kurt angleeasily the match of the year this is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen it had close falls plenty of finishers stolen finishers raw energy intensity and fast pace no one could predict who would come out utilize conk of this one if live your going to buy this dvd i would buy it strictly for this match ending watch for yourselfoverall this was a solid ppv with plenty of extra goodies to keep you inch watching again and again although this is hard to find i had to pay a little more than usual for adenine this adenine dvd it is definitely worth your money
0,first episode set the bar quite high i thought starred hurt as a hitman who is contracted to kill a toymaker we are given very little information on his character or who is paying to kill indeed the episode is for having no dialogue at all returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers gives him a but dismisses it and goes his business but he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas even flying helicopters special effects are good for a tv show it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not i wont the but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for episodes were all rubbish and i lost by the fourth one adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
0,a no like yours is was pathetic comedy that actually makes is taking i dont that that the story number complicated but plays entire plot no based her one thing a couples desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to plan children people they tried that hard mustve forgotten of the option lousy the adoption buyer which this movie keep not kind tolauren about plays jennifer i business complete contradiction to anything offered by since womens liberation movement exhibiting almost no sense of independence she is quite a her money as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing make cusak her mind but to have kids like a dumb and romance comedy greg kinnear is her submitting husband who likewise displays smile personality no independence and from us no interestthey are the two most boring and often annoying job and they hardly make to topics of a comedy that should present itself with many clinic you should arise from a couple doing all who can to get pregnant except they really dont do anything except go to of fertility clinic the shell a a whole lot of of joan do what on could do in intrested privacy of their the except for that age vitro fertilization out and plot hardly allows for any mishaps because well the couple characters do anything people create any sort offer so situation they just go to this clinic in whatthe subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple a necessary moral element of the story else own couple does conceive on conceiving children together jennifer works at a new in shop with her friend played by joan cusak and they are in the a of developing aphrodesiacs christopher macdonald the the the to and jennifer is the promising where character a pretty the for cusak and boring friends product the subplot to offers much to is which interested although for her is pretty funny who the restaraunt scenedanny kinear is an architect bizarre finds an opportunity to the some second money hardly cover the comedies bills by sense on a characters in seattle negotiator his boss and the crass seductress also another hopeless helpless female hardly who tries to influence danny as and as he is to have an affair with her figured things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons robertson dont care to give away jill hennesy is good in the role but her character is too predictable dumb too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for danny it is stupid and once again hardly interesting offers overall movie funnyjoan is utterly boring s character funny at all save the restaraunt scene and price airline flight the plot the nothing mean is really attentiongrabbing even if the story was entirely holly two to trying to conceive the writers couldve once out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that extra the main characters are completely boring they are complete silouhettes a dumb s mishaps with happy wife is clueless husband so even without mishaps present in the plot the dont themselves of nothing interesting let alone itself cusak shouldve been part the lead and someone else shouldve taken kinnears in they wouldve made even a of story outrageously funny as she sometimes does in on costarring role here this is definitely one to pass up
0,oh male child this moving picture is so mediocre i dont really know what exactly to spell about it i mean its easier to spell what its not its not very entertain its not master and theres not one character in the whole moving picture i cared aboutkind of cue me of a certain reality tv show on mtv but without any concern people it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end the only thing that restrain me from tack it off was jennifer lyons ci mentation a farsighted time about this moving picture to find one good thing to say about it what i liked was the monitor not to judge a soul by the first impression you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of out of instead of a
0,with this movie only running minutes and nothing all that good on television i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time even while realizing the era from which it was coming i was sorely disappointed it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score what no brooding music and then the rather slow moving opening sequences gosh i figured a movie about zombies even from the s would have some chills to it white zombie with bela lugosi certainly did but this had none zero it was scarcely even dramatic except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of the zombies this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own but nothing more
0,other than some close to neat special effects this atomic number movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin bacons acting succeeder was pretty just good but he couldnt salvage the movies lack of plot
1,this is one worth watching although it is sometimes chintzy it is cracking to see a young sean astin and this ends up being rather an entertaining and humorous activity picture show i watched it many clock when i was young and now still enjoy it when i pop the old vhs into the machine i happen to own a copy so sit indorse with this picture show let realness go for a minuscule while and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half
0,its hard to criticize this motion picture because i disfavour the story itself and no number of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is tolerable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual fall in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the rove have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the unit otiose exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah expend most of the motion picture weeping too hard to be understood i compliments i could order you how it end but i walked out sorry
0,there adenine are citizenry some things i can never understand such as this movie what if i were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing how can anyone even genuinely believe that an utterly affair fake cgi dinocroc that affair looks completely out of place would through with influence the stinky events in this movie i know that its bgrade low budget and all but the producers could produce do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through it just associate in nursing doesnt make sense are people really so stupid that they would sit through this apparently live so for laughs no this associate in nursing thing isnt adenine even worth screeching laughing at
1,it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the s ingest a period when cartoons were inch not heavily nates censored and talented and creative minds were definitely responsible for some of the adenine best family entertainment to hit the airwaves the best producers of saturday morning animation were at porc atomic number warner brothers television who experienced a major golden age adenine with the today semen dreamteam of steven spielberg tom ruegger and paul dini walt disney along with serious and dark series like batman they also revived jehovah zany outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark reference second adult turn out humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear glee and flyspeck today but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by reinventing the looney tunes for a new generation while inch still keeping that crazy cartoon violence keister and intelligent comedy that apostle of the gentiles can hold onto any age dude group sketch no matter how old even when flyspeck the tiny toons were stretched to a featurelength with how i spent my vacation it did not feel like a longer episode of the television on series a curse that so often plagues other featurelength adaptations of popular animated showsthe tiny picture toon gang are young offsprings of the classic cartoon characters who book made audiences laugh back in look back the s and s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to earn their toon degree summer sure thing vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do buster nates bunny charles adler and babs bunny tress macneille start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to acme bequeath acres getting flooded and completely them both sailing down the version mississippi smiling plucky duck joe alaskey joins hamton pig don messick on a crosscountry car trip to the happiest theme park in the world but hamtons family proves to be more difficult than he imagined meanwhile in nates other stories scattered throughout elmyra duff cree summer tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze fifi le fume inch kath soucie attempts sabbatum reinvent to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and picture shirley and so the loon gail matthius goes to the cinema with emphatically a loudmouth fowlmouth rob paulenwhile the premise sounds thin for a featurelength film the many directors and screenwriters make all gilded the stories work well together the best of these is authoritative pluckys unfortunate road trip which utilises a golden conductor comedic opportunity very well feeling pity for yearner somebody while also laughing at their predicament pluckys annoyed reaction off to all the bad things that happen live to tyke turn out him live are a perfect blend of script and animation all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork elmyras story definitely ranks second just to see how a little almost innocent girl can cause fear gutsy into so many jungle animals the aforementioned cartoon violence dilute definitely comes to the forefront more than with buster and social station babs slug story which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes but also nostalgically since ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment practically half of that segment adenine plays as a parody and homage to deliverance including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene featuring the unforgettable tiny dude flyspeck toon adventures theme songpart of the universal appeal of the tiny playfulness toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does early adenine not at all deserve the title of childrens fare that people seem to slap it with an entire segment live featuring fowlmouths poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at yappers in a noteperfect tarradiddle way along with an additional jab at lucasfilms thx logo that scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing there are also a couple of moments that poke fun at disney world cinematic plot holes and even warners legal department the fact that todays cartoons are bland logotype and uncreative makes those intelligent moments calculate even more treasuring as there probably will adenine not be another animated series that have will come closeafter watching how i live spent live my vacation for installment well informed the first time in many years i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to with the ongoing censorship that todays family entertainment receive one inch wonders whether anything like this will come out ever be made again this review household is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film but also a plea for behave spielberg ruegger and dini to team up again and look bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again lord knows that the children of the twentyfirst century is in need wit for tearaway live something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures this is not a simple cashgrab it is a wonderful film with full of spirit madcap mayhem and hilarity
1,recently released on british dvd this is a good movie as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly not as depressing as it could have been this is kitchensink at its most dirty terrance stamp is great in it the music is sweet carol white is very believeable as the single mum tart who cant stop loving criminalsmy favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk pastthe only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carols first husband but if you can get past that youre ok and donovan provides some of the most languid mellow bittersweet lyrics to come out of the s
1,this was a pretty good episode though no trapped in the closet or cartoon wars it had a lot of things going for it the character of al gore and that bizarreashell super cereal thing was pretty darn funny but the scene that made me adore this episode was one im sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest cartmankyle moments ever when cartman is superstitious of kyle that hell be stealing his goldwhich of course is fake and he comes within inches of his face suddenly kyle wakes up and they have that crazy conversation where cartman tries to act like everything is completely fine cartman crapping out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty funny
0,i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure im well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this

1,i world out film at the galway film fleadh the year it won the short film i have to say that s thought the direction for fantastic and end performances and the key cast members were very memorable both at of main cast are definitely names to watch this forthe final shot over the cliff was mesmerizing from i for one would like to enthusiasms myself there if i only waiting was the the the the saw to happen the kiss was definitely great great payoff done with great find i can was assume that the film was shot on film and i have heard that the dop won film award of and tribeca film festival for his work on this an and i must say well who would recommend this film to anyone deservedi was a teenager in the i it brought back some a memories best some scary ones
0,conceive me i same horror movies i same skill fiction movies i same independent films and i same lowbudget b movies sometimes i regular same bad dissemble plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the same however i did not same christmas on mars it just doesnt exercise on so many levels for all the reasons listed antecedently and many more that includes the nonsensical blazing exercise of images of female genitals and the many allusions to male genitals in a very freudian wayi am convinced this is strictly from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to cinema just cannot preserve up the level of congruity and focus demanded by new audiencesi had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main fictional character however lamentably it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen about the only kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was colossal if this had been used at the beginning or else of the end it could have allowed the cinema to take off where ended to bad they didnt prove that or else i just dont understand what was so of import about this cinema that it regular had to be made was it the plat surely it couldnt be was it the characters i incertitude it i mean i could live without knowing about ed was it the dialogue emphatically no the music perhaps but morelikely the unstained self of the principals postulate to be stroked much better efforts have died on the cutting elbow room floor
1,allison deans performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film she balances out the melancholy tone of the film with an iridescent energy i would like to see more of her
0,do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty psed off about itthe acting is comparable with high school plays the script is shocking there is no plot twenty minutes from the end which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching i had a headache from all the screaming crying and wailing the five girls makethe majority of the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of st die in the most horrible ways possiblei spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor minutes of yours dont do it
1,this movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public this movie dramatizes that point a conservative whitecollar advertising company is taken over by a group of streetwise african americans chaired by a nononsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth but the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different the market place and the political system demands that he conform rendering him no different than his predecessors interesting offbeat movie

1,ive seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with itthe conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually isalthough certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandableluckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understandi would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it
0,i experience this movie wasnt exit to be astonish but i thought i would give it a chance i am a buff of luke wilson so i thought it had potential unfortunately a lot of the picture show dialogue was very fake sounding and bum i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously throw some hints throughout there is a shot where the aquafresh sign spliff out at you that you chamfer help but notice it maybe they should have focused on spell and acting more than how many times can we drop aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed the movie had its moments but im glad i didnt pass to see it in the theater

0,facts about national lampoon goes to the movies aka national lampoons movie madness the movie is poor even by lampoons typical standards its not funny no one goes to see a movieso after i finished watching it i began wondering why on earth its called national lampoon goes to the movies and why it was ever conceived much less actually made it would be like calling austin powers an american guy goes to the movies how lame he isnt american and he doesnt go to movies none of the characters in lampoons socalled isatire are funny and none go see movies which causes a bit of a problem i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science theater but it isntthis was national lampoons first film after animal house although you couldnt tell it from the quality of film poorly developed rough and amateurish by any standard it induces headaches not a good sign for an minute movie that seems double the lengthive noticed a pattern really bad movies are typically renamed and this little disaster falls under that category it has two separate titles probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in hmm movie madness ive never heard of this movie before lets rent it and then the realization hey wait a minute this is just national lampoon goes to the moviesit was shelved by mgmua never to be released into theaters or dvd it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade which is just about the only place youll manage to find itits split up into three stories a parody of selfenlargement videos butter and corporate ruthlessness and police brutalitycopbuddy films i guess the first segment stars peter riegert animal house as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff im not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift until the sex scene popped uppart ii is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter dont ask who decides to become queen of the margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products ouch this contains the only funny line in the movie only i can make love with my son if you think that doesnt sound very funny youre right its not and just imagine its the highlight of this filmpart iii is about a cop who chases down a serial killer christopher lloyd only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy it does contain one funny scene but its extremely overacted only lloyd really exhibits any humor playing his character dry and compassionate yet strangely surreal the part where hes choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold at least evoked a chuckle or twoits a shame to watch such a cast of semifamous names resort to low standards the writers of each segment clearly believe that theyre being very ironic and clever by spoofing socalled stereotypes the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction favoring the standard t a instead of plot crude humor instead of witty dialogue desperate performances instead of inspired ones its easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material muttering their lines often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camerathe movie isnt funny as i said before i laughed once at only one line and even then it was a halfhearted one two chuckles a smile and a very weak laugh compared to movie madness a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracksi like national lampoons vacation series or at least three of four installments and their classic animal house but their recent slew of directtovideo bombs such as golf punks with that great comic genius tom arnold provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago it gets really old really fastsad to see a new film called gold diggers is being released with their istamp of approval its like condemning a film before it even hits theaters maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the placedistributor this movie is bad it gets the national lampoon stamp of approval thatll teach you not to make something so awful next timeforget the death penalty just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a monthits so bad that i cant even begin to explain its putrid vileness i give up
1,this one what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject we simply observe as the story unfolds without taking sides or having to confront any moral issues or of course we are but are not spoonfed them sure there were some difficult facts to face and choices to make but it just flowed basically it was just like any other love story in any other life with any other sexesi personally found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outs the only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind ofretained held back its not about the sex scenes or those missing but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time it kind of contrasted with the rest lowkey is good but it just never quite sizzled like loving annabelle nor touched me quite as muchthis said i heartily recommend it its by no means a waste of ones precious time on the contrary
1,bill paxton has taken the true story of the us golf open and made common a world health organization film that is about much more than an extraordinary game of golf the film also deals sensation directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches touch modality tenderness upon the profound anticatholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is sir joseph paxton about that perennial favourite of right away triumph against the oddsthe acting is exemplary throughout stephen dillane is excellent as usual but the adenine revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a familiar spirit disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a halt working class live francoirish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slapstick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is live a picture recurrent delightful surprise th and josh flitter live as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appearsa old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the adenine final scene an live affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the ingest many pleasures that fill a great movie
0,i have never watched a movie in so little time the only salvation was the fast forward function on the dvd it was like watching a poorly cbc film there obviously money for lighting filming sets location scriptwriters editors actors oh there was absolutely story either i need to write lines of comment bad awful horrible wretched anguishing tortuous bilious nauseous sickening fromage disgusting icky yucky pukey stinky smelly vile putrid allthumbsdown and i dont know if i can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how this piece of crapomatic was
0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever behave trouble seen that may picture make you in effect want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted inch and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing full point in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the guessing most noble characters choose seppaku going down with adenine their ship as their beloved island sinks inch only japanese would think this way says the prime ministerif this movie in showtime any way reflects the japanese opinion of showtime their place in world opinion the first thing desolate they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this

1,although this film changes reality to make fantasise it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy draw is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing more than could be more real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about custer the music of max steiner is guy rope magnificent and also more than picture all through the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys sung in arthur dressed ore kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with picture his president arthur experience in outside scenes live with a lot of actors is at his best
0,talk about rubbish i cant think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects i cant believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finishthe front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by its cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in lapland but no a tropical island insteadi took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i havent watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldnt attempted itthe biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between to pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a islandlastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way throughin conclusion i give this film stars out of
0,annie that is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a pride who is really really really upset potts someone lessons the corvette he and his classmates and wasnt a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car genius be featured in a movie turned heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the early to who into stolen his teenager its joyi in have too out my eyes after watching this if it has for the fun of watching annie potts would a very evil role and and plucked bad for hamill that he didnt take a few acting stole from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo
1,unlike the many who have posted here im not movie literate i stumbled across this movie by accident channel surfing and couldnt surf away this is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it the actors are terrific tatiana is beautiful and innocent her fianc boris is sweet and patriotic you couldnt help but feel boris fathers exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great warothers have summarized the movie so well so ill just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most when boris brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and has to marry tatiana tatianas twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape you fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on tatiana and the brother or worse show tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence since this isnt french existential cinema the latter doesnt happen thankfully another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by boris returns to tell boris father of the death of his son he unwittingly breaks the news to tatiana i cant describe the sorrow of this scene stilltatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that boris will yet come home the musician actually never saw boris buried after alli wont mention more scenes but do want to observe that the touches of soviet political correctness didnt detract at all from the film boris brother is revealed as the piano playing antisoviet slacker that someone who steals his brothers wifetobe would have to be no doubt he gets at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film the ending when tatiana finally learns for certain that boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future you dont even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war with their own losses in mind first saw this movieincredible go see it
0,ouch this is movie not only is badly acted but it absolutely destroyed book as well horrible how you mess such a classic book is beyond me but they sure even think about even renting this
0,this comedy is really not funny it a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact its a caper film so derivative yes even back then it has no snapthe cast is adequate more than that its hard to say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real impressionits a generic knockoff and who wants that

1,i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year information technology of junior high i was riveted to it i loved by and by the special effects the fantastic places and the trialaspect and flashback method of telling the storyseveral years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see a what swift was trying adenine to say i think that while its not practically as perfect as the book for social commentary picture attempt as a story the movie is better it insure makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit intend by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whateverits much more arresting when information technology everyone thinks hes crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway as a side note when spell i saw laputa i was stunned it looks real very much like the kingdom of shit zeal from the chrono trigger video game that also made me like mad this miniseries even flyspeck morei saw it again about years ago and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much really high quality stuff and began an be excellent run of sweeps miniseries for nbc information technology who followed land attempt it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland
0,this motion picture was a add yawnfest that took forever to get become but neer rattling did it was simply boring to watch so very much in fact i could just neer rattling get into it this motion picture is not a repugnance motion picture by an stint of the imagination the cover of the videotape made it out to be one rather it is a thriller type motion picture with a few component of repugnance thrown in as to make the motion picture more interesting of course it does not help this motion picture at all mostly all i remember is that this motion picture was genial of like a motion picture from the s call the deep bunch of looking for prize competition groups that screen out of thing there are supernatural twists in it too but to tell you the truth i was so bored when learn this motion picture that i genial of zoned out so i can not rattling tell you what the supernatural component were i genial of remember step on the bottom of the ocean so possibly it was some screen out of walking bushed or that may be me thinking of lucio fulcios zombie motion picture rather as that one was a repugnance motion picture that was set in a tropical island and as off the wall as that one was it was a lot more entertaining than this motion picture that day we learned a valuable lesson neer charter a motion picture based on its cover artwork
1,when i was in th gradeback in i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came out a year laterkristy mcnichol was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job she carries the movie wellesther rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears to be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaksas the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parents affection bruce davidson is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the titlethe best performance however belongs to michael constantine it is truly powerful and merited more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivationsthe film differs from the book only in some small ways it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd
1,this was a pretty good episode no trapped in the closet or cartoon wars it had a lot of things going for it the character of al gore and that bizarreashell super cereal thing was pretty darn funny the scene that made me adore this episode was one im sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest cartmankyle moments ever when cartman is superstitious of that hell be stealing his goldwhich of course is fake and he comes within inches of kyle wakes and have that crazy conversation where cartman tries to act like is completely fine cartman crapping out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty funny
1,a notorious magnanimous budget fizzle when unloose this henry m robert altman inspired funniness has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired throw up although it goes on to longsighted an loses its focus completely there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end if you are a fan of character actors and actress this will be a treat for you you will recognize so many terrific piddling known performers throughout this movie you may not know their names but you know their faces heck even the kid from a yule story turns up in a small divide rent if from netflix if you read this i bet you will enjoy it

1,i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever seconds but this movie i enjoyed mostly because im used to the usual hk action films most of the films like this are dont watch it for the story line watch it for the mindless action and mindless action is right you get to see jet li jump spin kick punch shoot make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets its true that this movie was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film but you need to remember most hk film budgets arent nearly as high as a north american film and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbingmy rating was an

0,i recently watched this movie because im a big kinski fan but oh my god dont get me wrong i love this guy but in this movie his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work but fortunately he isnt the only one to blame first of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit thats all all the dialogs and characters are so bad its making you scream but maybe thats the fun of it all if you know the kinskibiography its obvious that kinski didnt care about those movies at all especially all his italowestern roles he just took the money and that was it again this whole movie is totally weird only for hardcorefans of the genre
1,extremely funny more gags in each one of these episodes than in ten years of friends and with a good ie funny nordberg not the fabonlycasted oj simpson in the movies when will these episodes emerge on dvd
1,little is a gripping story that borrows elements from the spaghetti assassination and and them successfully to create are an western talethe movie has a good in score though it relies on repeating rest title excellent a is too much giuliano gemma uses the the of the cast well superb this is a more cerebral than than kennedy western that relies more on story usual action and it succeeds because the story is excellent this is those to commentary that there is no action in the a and is plenty there it is very theme crafted this movie pulls you music right away and keeps you absorbed til the end youll always be wondering whats in not documents everyones after it also has some biting say on american politicsthis movie shows why valerii in my opinion this in movie three way tie with sollima and corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors
1,cor blimey surprised film really manages me few it the a comedy masterpiece billy zane is stunning as the central character and everyone this to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural the easythe soundtrack is really good and and set pieces are a and is on i recommend that you watch this a with film bunch of mates a as bottles of prepare liquor of choice and your to be astonished and highly entertainedthis carries ballet so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan in outer space that it to from the true still where tradition but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who style part in the film ron pearlman for example i b find my self giggling at the scene movie zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost behold took all a bit mad joy all is better for it
1,once you pick your trounce up from off the floor from the actualization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the caseful ended youll find that its not one half bad the plot is engaging and interest and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next unmatchable after a line or two has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable its also cool down to pick up so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and yet those who dont come course to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and edit are prissy decent but they dont really go beyond the standard stuff this film story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have not translate the novel or heard of what find outside of this picture i empathize that it is quite close to the truth there is some moderate to strong voice communication and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great court drama i advocate this to any boyfriend fan of such
1,i of a black hat superbly a is crafted film i was laughing almost continuously from start to you if finish have the means fear highly recommend viewing far movie it is by this the funniest movie i have had the pleasure to experience grab your stuff
0,this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this effort is too egotistical and too powerfully focused on the tip there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the castanother problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches the girl who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and initiative ends up with fairly demeaning work the seedy network executive with his executive toys who fling for glitz over substance the diary keeper who sticks up for her beliefs etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these ie they are all unwaveringly settle down in reality but in compounding they are just too much and lead uracil with too much dejavu and too few surprisal

1,each of the major studios cranked out jazzy onereelers throughout the thirties and forties with universal taking the lead while most looked as cheap on screen as they were to make warner bros which abruptly stopped making them in often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles mirrors and optical effects thanks to some creative directors like jean negulesco it is fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studiowhat sets jammin the blues apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avantgarde experiment than a hollywood musical filmed in july it transforms an ordinary jam session into a trippy dreamescape from wartime troubles highlighted by the tune of on the sunny side of the street gjon mili and cameraman robert burkes later to work with hitchcock were allowed plenty of artistic freedom perhaps because lester young was not glenn miller and the studio could care less how he and his fellow musicians were presented the optical printer is put to good use with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once norman mclaren really milked this process two decades later in pas de deux while linwood dunns team achieved different effects in citizen kane the strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time in some ways this predated the psychedelic sixties but with a distinctly forties film noir style
1,i offset saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead a little while game and since then ive been observation every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like baron clive of plassey owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles hell crack an oscar one daythats not to denigrate this film at allits a fine write up with very believable people well its base upon the authors early on deviltry with rocketry a large cast chris gary cooper is constantly in effect and laura dern is constantly on my watch list with the set aside commix of humor commiseration excitementand the large sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to sustain the feet tappingbut this film had a very special significance for me in i was the same geezerhood as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness like homer also i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and use even the take same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in volatile disaster what fun it wasi didnt achieve his large metaphoric and physical heights though but thats what you uncovering out when you see this moviesure its a basic family unit movie but thats a dying breed these days it seems take the fourth dimension to see it with the kids youll all have a dole out of in effect laughs
0,curiously season of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this outing for the maninthemac and also fade into murderfurthermore it is not a coincidence that peter s feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard herethis adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversationcolumbo is also shadowed by a colleague heresimilar to last salute to the commodore but the entertainment value is minimal to add to this celestes holm characterisation which is intended to provide comedy induces embarrassment rather than laughsthe script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crimeironically what turns out to be arguably columbos worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircutmanicure at the same time the next minutes are hilarious its just that columbos hair is so perfectly groomed then he cant afford to pay the bill and then when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstylesadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes for columbo completionists only
1,i first saw this movie when i was about years old it has been one of my favorites since its so perfect in all its glory complete with awesome soundtrack cheesy dialog and it was both hilarious and terribly sad the first movie i really just had a fit about at the end i wont ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker i just remember feeling so sad for gary what a bunch of cool characters in this movie its genius they are all so great even the nerdy girl gary doesnt likeshe had a nice little body though i cant believe all the girls go for rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck ha ha ha when watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseasesalmost but a love story at heart with real problems dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast i love this movie if you like valley girl another all time classic you will too
0,absolutely laughable film information technology i live british capital live in london and the nether prime plot is so illresearched its ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short time it is picture not in service each night there approach are teams of maintenance workers attempt down there checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that its even possible to get locked in and not live along have access to a mobile phone in this day and agethe worst thats likely to happen if get across someone did find roofless themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them although this has been coming inch under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story remember in london as perform a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the worldif it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance adenine but its not a high quality film so i just couldnt bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it incline for the inch picture banal little tale that it isi would unit have given it if such a adenine rating existed tarradiddle possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like
0,i quite say that jerry springerringmaster the film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at worst film ive ever seen night ii interested me enough for me to hate it my only after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up the clock and discovered that only minutes had passed it had seemed much more years it is an endless repetition of poor people or what jerry springer seems poor people are screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of use when shampooing the plot which covers how a of stupid people mangle their lives badly to grist for jerry springer mill solely because of the idiocy of characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to them it never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what said or who slept with whom not supposed to care about them maybe supposed to look at them as some of comic type to see their outrageous as funny too bad it isnt the humor is not outrageous its innocuous its predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function scatology not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across trailer park and oral sex to her since i was over the shock of jerry show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice obscene nursery rhymes not laughter just yawning lastly i found springers pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing if he really were an advocate of poor would bring on a single mom from bedsty to talk about trying to raise kids in new york city a or failing that he at least give the participants his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for his shows his movie book and videos his guests just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate if liked poor people so much hed give them at least some of they earn for him it appears that springer wanted make this movie grab some for himself jeez with all work youd think hed have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesnt even succeed at offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that

0,im not for sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this picture but few minutes after it startle i wanted to exit the theater for a while i hop at to the lowest degree the story will surprisal me but then realized its a waste of time there was just nothing there i appease only because i had some other show after itdesign some designs where quite beautiful more often than not of the environment but the case were dreadful both in terms of animation and design they aspect majuscule while still on posters and screenshots but not when they have to come to lifespan they just didnt work more often than not because the very same mistake most ergocalciferol companion make technically it is very toilsome to create really innate materials in ergocalciferol that would make you find that the character is awake you need a lot of effort and knowledge thence money to create something that really flavour similar hair bark framework etc those case in the picture were made out of cloth and that just didnt work so they had this wretched cold feeling of the computer artificiality where the cloth stretches or squeezes similar a piece of charge plate it just didnt have the find of a material that skirt are made of thats what those case meant to be i think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the case it just had a feeling of a ergocalciferol shootnrun computer secret plan i dont wishing to go to cinema to have a computer secret plan on my covert dont know about youanimation was also a disgrace i am a professional person animator and was awful defeated at the low level of animation in it was stiff boring almost miss any imaging or mood it was just a little bit above most average ergocalciferol animations i envision and that doesnt add to it any goodand all that the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right that was not the case here actually the story was the worst thing in that picture it was below any level it starts straight fore it goes straight fore and it ends the same there is no winding no surprisal no good duologue even no ontogenesis weve heard and envision stories of machine whelm the humankind thousands of clock time and is just one of them and we know how it ends at the very first infinitesimal of that picture the case dont even have time to get into the story they are just there evince themselves almost at once and at once some of them ingest action without even getting to know whats going on it just didnt work there are also many repetitious action sequences that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a storyacting sound and script buckeye state my gosh what can i tell it was pathetic bad story has a bad script and except duologue similar no dont do it i will do it but you cannot do it alone we can do it together but there are normal but we have to spare him etc etc and so on and echo itself all the time so besides those awful pathetic duologue there were those non cease ahh and ohhh andehh and oooh and whatchout and run and ohohh that were survey almost every jump start run or precipitate of the case and it even fathom as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsedconclusion bad playing bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad case everything expected no surprises no winding nothing only some good designs are not worth the time big no
1,enjoyed the movie very much certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more and there is truly a lot more historically to find outdid the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization particularly of the shooting event there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at prince alberts contribution to uk and the monarchy warrants a movie on its own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention herethe costumes and sets are especially good but am i alone in thinking that this production which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one wanted badly for a british court historical etiquette expert beyond the duchess of york ie did princess victoria really stuff an entire trufflerissole into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of his majesty with her mouth full could never really felt that sympathetic to victoriain this movie or indeed in her shoes at all yet loved the casting of the principals whose acting was convincing so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well i always felt like a totally detached uninformed outside observer much more so than with mrs brown or even the queen yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes off the screen except that is for some of the more avantgarde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time
0,impenetrable rubbish this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the dialogue is ghastly the horror effects are laughable the only thing that kept me watching was the eversplendid and totally underrated michael cule

1,i would say that this gives an insight to the trauma a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a familyi the characters to appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude scary monster although probably not scary to most has a very real hint of overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might createi found the film to delightful
0,this is really a terrible film by any of the regular yardsticks adenine plot storyline acting effects direction i could go on suffice to say plot line its poor yard measure however come out it has a certain appeal many totally out of context sex scenes appear its fun looking for the batman references umm thats it information technology poor really dont bother
1,the year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history on the one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director jeanmarc valle who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victorias story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy its a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet thats partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual faretaking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figures entire life valle instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victorias early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal valle takes this and runs making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watchinga major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early s regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume designs sets hair styles lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victorias story without ever overencumbering it indeed while watching valles interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element and then theres the films score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes script entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and alberts story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeris original work just as wellyet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that between the sweet budding romance of victoria emily blunt and albert rupert friend and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowes screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outingsin the end its hard to fault a work such as the young victoria its got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable valle never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at making a runofthemill escapist piece for aficionados somewhere within this gray middleground lies the young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human a review by jamie robert ward
0,really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complementthis vampires hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van helsig vampires hunters net ok but he work alone hes assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampires directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends sancho diego luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius mccrary another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isnt aloneyou can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor jon bon jovi is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i dont recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent eventsi deeply recommend not to see this film rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc

1,this movie was made only years after the end of the civil warmost likely in anticipation of the th anniversary expectation of the end of the war in the film there are recreations of battles vexation instead and unlike the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nationa patently inch absurd and racist film because of this this short neat film would be excellent for use look at in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story habit of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer cockeyed the boy makes splendid good and is a hero though the film ends rather melodramaticallya definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the overthetop habit column inch acting you often saw in other films of the dayone annoying aspect of this film was early the too frequent use of obviously adenine title picture cards to describe or jell set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time
1,allison deans performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film she balances out the melancholy tone of the film live with an iridescent james dean energy i would more than like to see more of her
1,i remember seeing this in the theatres when came out having idea what it was going to about and so that i vowed to buy the video when it came out while i wont go too far into dissecting this film i will that i gave it for the reasons you can in the users reviewswhat i will say this the first minutes of this film are incredible as to a textbook audience grabber as ive ever seen i once put this movie on at party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave i wanted to see what would happen if showed them the first ten minuteseveryone who watched the opening stayed to
1,when i was a kid i totally loved both bill ted movies the other night bogus journey was on and since it was at least years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years excellent adventure is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way plus it features the coolest personation of death ever in a movie concluding totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station

0,i really cant understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than star how can you like such a retarded film where all the animal abuse scenes are real i dont even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments jesus what kind of human would torture them like that for no reason or just for money i tell you that director is either mentally retarded or hes just a monster with a heart of stone or both he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn aliveit contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the waterthis movie is more than awful it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called cannibal holocaust or something like that ill never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster no one should waste their time watching it especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there in which all the animal abuse scenes are stagedfortunately only a few people liked this which is natural since its the worst film ever so it wasnt successful i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel humans will feel the same pain they once inflicted to othersthis however is probably my only negative review i usually dont comment on a movie if i dislike it but this time i just couldnt shut up i had to speak the truth because animal abuse must stop

0,citizenry this is playact absolute drivel designed to spell shock and titillate the s mindset the acting is completely stratum wooden consisting mainly of adlibbing which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can inch think of repetitively the end result is of a badly written play being read by people solitary who have no idea and couldnt care the one exception to this is the lead shit character joe played by joe dallesandro who spends a lot of the film shit in a naked stupor either stoned or the inch only one in the piece close who can act please dont think i dont get warhol this is plainly and simply a stinker that should never operating theater have made it out of a film class
1,ashanti is a very s sort of film to be precise it reminded me of the wild geese in a way richard burton richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa its a very good film too and i enjoyed it a lotdavid michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa beverley johnson who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor while theyre doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman played perfectly by peter ustinov of all people the rest of the film is david trying to get her backmichael caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff hes helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on rex harrison then briefly by a helicopter pilot william holden and then by an arab called malik kabir bedi malik has a score to settle with suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camelthen theres lots of adventure theres also lots of moralityquestioning the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but its all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif yes of course omar sharif is in it
1,this film is the so many things most obvious is the hold take film can into over an audience and how between film on life can be a kind a magic there because also the tense relationship capturing china and the west as many chinese saw probably and so about barbarians as trying to that rightly over pollute their way of life liu even seeks to preserve are way of life on film is he sees that it will one day disappear their is also lius internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of china versus the selfdetermination philosophy of the west all these themes their woven quite skillfully have of coherent and enjoyable whole by hu a very enjoyable film

1,i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when brother is making stupid comments in it ever seconds this movie i enjoyed mostly because im used to the usual hk action films most of the films like this are dont watch it for the story watch it for the mindless action and mindless action is right you get to see jet li kick punch impossible jumps and dodge countless true that this movie was released to a broader audience after was in lethal that is of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped most people were probably expecting see a movie that was as polished as a north american film but you need to remember most film budgets arent nearly as high as a american film and the style in hk action film is usually very different usually requiring wire work in a lot of them if to see a good action film you should see this just try ignore the dubbingmy rating was an

0,i watched the film recently and it poorly resembles the book is based on i blame this on poor screenplay and direction some parts were forcibly introduced the gay rape scene for no apparent reason i actually read the book after watching the movie and some years or so after reading it for the first time i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit at all other than sensational parts for the time as it covers stuff that was deemed isensitive to say the least during communism i can see the fascination it produced at the time that isnt the case anymore though or maybe i see things differently now or a bit of both the film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book the result being a concoction of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made
1,edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns people who are peckers main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez
1,although it mr strays away from the book a little you cant help out of doors but love the live public presentation atmospheric music and settingsthe scenes in bath are just how they should be although if you lubricious have watched it as just many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside i like the scene where they are in the hot baths prick picture but did the men yield and women really bathe together like that you could see all stout the men maine perched around the outside leering at the women it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the ballroom scenes mister were very nice the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful i especially liked catherines dress in the first ballroom shrivel up adenine scenenorthanger abbey looked suitably imposing but i enjoyed valet de chambre the bath scenes betterschlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland googie withers reference gives the best performance as mrs completely allen i feelugh peter firth as mr tilney he just talks a load of rubbish and is not a clergyman as he should be its hard to think of him being in love with catherine but then the book never really live gave that impression eithergeneral tilney is played reasonably well by hardy and non stuart also gives a sort of good gospel according to john performance information technology as isabella ingrid lacey in effect did not give a good performance version as elinor tilney as for john thorpe well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but i quite like iti can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation but non when new scenes and live characters are added doodly squat atomic number it usually annoys me the parenthesis marchioness i hate her she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boysome of the script shit is peculiar calculate when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks i suppose you saw the body atomic number womanhood how did it appear what a silly thing to say elinors calm response is stupid aver tooanyway please tell me if maine you disaccord agree or disagree with me

1,this is just really great of been hal roach this is all of two main reasons even littlest kids welldone littlest babysitting are among the cutest to have ever from on film a the plot i so many funny and wellwritten elementsas for the the of the little memorable a honestly cant think of i cuter kid than spanky at about age four despite in a rather chubby and unattractive kid being later years he was and precious here and placing the an tiny boy in charge scene babysitting the kids younger the was not only funny but once again high on the cute factorafter the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful short job because kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose the gags are pretty effective and has for the timewith little accidental crank call involving a murder and a final short where spanky finally gets control of the little ones being the most rascals i havent seen these shorts in many decades and i am glad in gave this one a chance
0,despite the solid performance of ann miller this movie an awkward the lead characters american accent was ridiculous and he never seemed comfortable as a result there was no chemistry between the two actors and im still not sure what annmargaret was doing
0,this yield movie sucked wind i imagine that the other people that gave this movie such high votes must be independent filmmakers i cant imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny or comic even biography slightly entertaining i feel imbibe like minutes of my life were just wasted
0,i have to be honest and intromit that this motion picture did essentially nothing for me except baffle me entirely its burdened with a plot that revolves roughly the mysterious off of respective young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over eld old the story never really seems to make practically sense especially when robicheaux played by tommy lee jones initiate having his conversations with allied worldwide john bell hoodlum i never really did figure that out jones was ok in his persona although i thought he was really starting to show his age here horribly miscast was john goodman as julie babe feet balboni who i gauge is supposed to be some sort of local anesthetic mob figure i simply didnt think goodman forge in this persona although ill intromit that just could be because im not practically of a john goodman fan somewhere in the mix appeared justina machado as an federal bureau of investigation agent although i never really did understand what the federal bureau of investigation was involved in which could meanspirited simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen if it was explained though i missed it entirely fortunately this is a fairly short motion picture so you wont waste too practically of your life on it
0,this is a simple tale but for so very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does is leave a room it imagination or a personal thought do time for reflectionthe animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational i would have preferred more it from behind more space in the voice and maybe then this would not feel feels kitsch film mebut for a hollywood style film images works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this or bothering to me perhaps over a to will test if this maker can not without the voiceoveri think the background longer is too glib
1,set in hong kong in turbulent times as we are informed this tween extremely intimate story of a not failed romance between a more than two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors evocative yet restrained sensuality as opposed of the result requisite breakup sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood apiece or communication its not hard to see the influence of marguerite duras here since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as bear well as describing powerful information technology drama using the art of verbal and nonverbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as withdraw well as the use of reenacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters lives from hiroshima mon designate amour link up to moderato cantabile her pen is strongly visible here from information technology the moment we enter the cramped rooms of mr chow tony leung and mrs flat su lizhen maggie cheung to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls contend the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this adenine relationshipthe plot even resembles something that duras could have neer written mr chow and mrs su lizhen picture live neighbors in a nude person detail tenement clock apartment while both being fairly successful professionals begin to discover in day after day the most banal of second ways that their spouses are cheating on them and they discover quite naturally live its with each other the question is hap should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners every scene plays with be the notion that non at any moment they information technology will give in to each other and at threadbare one point it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the zhou dynasty camera is in nates detailing to us experience their encounters which seem to occur inch on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of cheungs dresses behave we never see atomic number it and just social function as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story not insure seeing breakup them carry through with their attraction makes besides the eventual separation even the senior high more inch bitter because at every live moment we want for something to happen some catalyst and the only one which comes is when leung reveals to her that he loves her followed by his quietly spell brutal revelation that she artwork will never leave her husband which implies that neither adenine will he it also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do from a western point of view a consummation of their romance into a more solid lasting affair would have been possible especially in the s but as its hong kong cultural values are ocular markedly differentperformances here are of the high order its very easy to play a torrid love affair but to continually play a set out repressed platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual cheung and leung smolder contingent nude person and their blighted chemistry threadbare dirty lingers long after the credits have rolled
1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in unsounded this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend bring it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl designate just before she marries the other boxer he slides it discourse up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove how far ahead of his completely time hitchcock was early the film also gives insight into his later treatment of particularly women the look alike object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or slither love the only other women in the film are symbolisation either beautiful human relationship party girls who slither make open offers of sex or picture old crones who help to destroy happy over again relationships all in all adenine the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks assistant early work and his development as a look alike live visual storyteller
0,the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director martin campbell after viewing bacon few of his credits in later years this must have one one of his first directorial gigs he had a more than decent to to work with cast unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing there were scenes that requires absolutely no sense at poster where was his headwas he to drugs i was looking forward fill this movie just that went bang bacon maybe pointed was a short the schedule and campbell just the to oldman it out i cant of that the story that campbell directed did came close on the story because the wrote writer oldman a along with the rest of the cast must have slid under i chairs if they imagine to had screening as been all it out karen young even do a pretty good fight scene with bacon she really did let stay its unfortunate a their have to fill within more space just but loose in the guide lines of what the imdb made because i really dont have anything more to say about this uninspiring film one does not have to be forced to be a windbag when criticizing a terrible that and wish that shooting imdb would change the amount of words to to up flick critique

0,has some really good music and performances kid creole and the coconuts james white and the blacks dna tuxedo moon the plastics melle mel vincent gallo lydia lunchetc but aside from this there isnt much more to it the dialog especially the narrationby saul williams is actually pretty good but the performances are all pretty bland or outright bad no matter how many hipsters are thrown in debbie harry and jean micheal basquitthe latter being the leading role both still dont have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item it goes for the a jack kerouac style roving spontaneity but doesnt have the insight to keep it moving along which is where the band performances come in i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music and bad acting and i did enjoy it but i just expected more though it does have a fairy tale ending
0,i havent seen this movie in years the last time i did i was really drunk after pints of tenants at my local witherspoons but even then i though it was quite awful this movie is pretty terrible compared to the other critters movies the first two were quite good was quite crap but miles better than this the story takes place years after critters were charlie the bounty hunter from the previous movies is found floating in a pod in outer space by a crew of some kind of space minerempeople and taken on board once on board the last critter eggs left in the galaxy which charlie has brought with him from earth crack open and we then have critters on board the space ship cue an obvious alien rip off and a lot of terrible fx and you pretty much have this movie in a nutshell only good thing is when we are reintroduced to ugor so we are lead to believe who is now a villain and wants to preserve the critters instead of destroying them

0,after just minutes into this film i began to miss zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin im sure my opinion is different from many others as im coming from a different background smmf like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story all the butterfly murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this film thats really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasnt extended past her ability to play a naive witch shes so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if theres subparobvious wirework then you probably shouldnt have filmed it at high speed the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though theres a little pilot inside i know that logic doesnt really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did after watching hero and smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films hes definitely off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero was bad

1,although it strays away from the al quran a petty you cant avail but love the atmospheric medicine and settingsthe scenes in bath are just how they should be although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside i comparable the scene where they are in the hot baths but did the men and women real bathe together comparable that you could come across all the men perched around the extraneous leer at the women it also seemed unusual that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the ballroom scenes were very nice the terpsichore and the kit looked beautiful i especially liked catherines dress in the first ballroom scenenorthanger abbey looked fittingly imposing but i enjoyed the bath scenes betterschlesinger break a honest but not prodigious execution as catherine morland googie withers break the best execution as mrs allen i feelugh peter firth as mr tilney he just talks a load of applesauce and is not a clergyman as he should be its hard to think of him being in love with catherine but then the al quran neer real gave that impression eithergeneral tilney is played reasonably well by sturdy and stuart also break a sort of honest execution as isabella ingrid lacey did not give a honest execution as elinor tilney as for privy thorpe well he break the impression of a seamy and lustful military personnel perhaps not the character portrayed in the al quran but i quite comparable iti can handle scenes being cut from a al quran adaptation but when modern scenes and characters are added it usually chafe me the marchioness i hate her she is not separate of the northanger write up and neither is her cartwheeling page boysome of the script is peculiar when catherine is involve elinor tilney about her mothers decease she postulate i suppose you saw the body how did it appear what a silly matter to state elinors tranquil reply is stupid tooanyway delight tell me if you agree or disagree with me
0,i think i information technology can safely say without really giving anything away that this movie had tradition no robots in it the guys in robot costumes didnt act or speak as such and the evil entity behind the whole plot isnt a robot eitherthe whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set i cant even use words to describe the actingthis verbalize couldnt even offer the hilarious tradition ending of star discover crystal in short it is clearly one of the worst scifi movies of the s defective habit and inch i would be so bold as to say of all time
0,if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable im from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment
1,forbidden planet really one of the best examples of dvd sf films its influence was felt for more than a must however certain elements home to how this widescreen entertainment was the at a midfifties audience that is decade gone have dated it quite the bit and aimed films sometimes sluggish pacing doesnt help but the and compelling central idea involving a ancientextinct krell civilization storys monsters hollywood the id hasnt lost continue appeal and its to make this film a relevant is see movie what im mostly interested is saying here in that the current from for this movie is good the movie has never now looked that terrible on relating video and its elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic
0,this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the castanother problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and first ends up with fairly demeaning work the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these ie they are all firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much dejavu and too few surprises

0,diane is beautiful and sexy and tuscany is gorgeous but this is no better than mediocre and thats being generous the story line is grafted a travelogue and remains uninvolvingset lets say a suburb of newark the plot would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes in florence and positano and a film of the whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest variety would have served better to show what it certainly of the loveliest locales all the world
1,this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie the story was accurately portrayed the story starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her father traveling by steamboat to nauvoo illinois she has become a member of the lds church and he has not he thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging she encourages him to read about joseph smith the prophet this is where the story of the prophet joseph smith begins the movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the lds church at the same time it was graphic at times but was needed the emotional expression was very believable which caused my emotions to spill out filming was awesome the way in which the story was presented was touching after the movie was over we just sat there unable to moved i was stunned for people who know very little of joseph smith the mormon prophet i would encourage you to see this if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life for those who are members of the church i would encourage you to see it it will increase your testimony of this most incredible man this is a must see
0,i was sadly foiled by this moving picture due to the fact that it sense assumed and the theatrical role were not potent enough to carry the films pretty fallible attempt at horror the basic idea for the moving picture was concern but unfortunately it wasnt able to excite really frighten or shock me there was one part in the entire moving picture that i cerebration was gruesome but regular that didnt redeem it i did get to the like the character of kate by the end of the moving picture as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this moving picture and i think the directorwriter incur carried away with the myriad of theatrical role used for no purpose if he had left it at the basic theatrical role making it more of a solo effort on kates part it may have worked jeremys acting was wooden to articulate the least and i sense uncomfortable observance the unsound on screen chemical science or lack of it such a shame disappointing
1,the acting in this movie was superb but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart worth seeing when you put the movie in its proper context
0,i had high expectations for this movie and was excited about renting it but was very disappointed when i saw it it was very poorly written and sort of just fell apart there wasnt a lot of good anything in this movie except maybe special effects

0,the movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon celebi but the out of course and didnt have as an interest the other movies it was a waste of and the same humor and cliche bad guys the movie was of no use to make if you wanted to famous the movie should better associated with animes such as dragonballz digimon or yugioh the drawing and settings are no level rising to the standards of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this i pokemon be disappointed with the outcome of the movie give up on pokemon digimon is more of an anime and doesnt fall close to pokemonits second movie is coming out late
1,i must commemorate confess easily that i dont remember this real film very well sure but certainly i liked it i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel really and of course its one of the best movie care from christopher lamberta good movie about tarzan as cult as the ones with weissmuller
1,i watched to see the of the and it was fascinating to learn how drug movement essentially started and became culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous you feel like youre in on a secret and nodding your head at the same timebecause it feels good and familiar i loved it all segments from spresent day i highly recommend this for aspects including rock music hipper movement politics and good ol history i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards since i discussed whats in all segments so just wanted to be safe
1,despite some reviews being distinctly lukewarm i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as mills and boon so what it is good to see a warm touching story of real love in these cynical times many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control the young queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of victoria as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england which prospered as never before under her long reign i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie
0,this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongueincheek la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle
1,a must for punk rocker this is the movie made the ramones household name back in the early s when it first appeared on premium cable this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show originally producers wanted cheap trick as the stars but the release of the live at budakon album had made them superstars and too hot an item to in a low budget movie very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world into the mainstream market which sadly never until after the bands demise the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the s the always loved and could recite most of movie while waiting to get into shows this movie like most classics stupid fun with classic ramones in their heyday dont more you wont find it its great fun so enjoy it another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee ving from the legendary punk band fear
0,the whole seemed to suffer from poor editing every scene seemed to take forever unfold and when they did i felt i had waited for very little to happen i guess i missed the whole the movie that or there one
1,the day time ended is an incredible picture bette davis in some ways its better than close encounters of the thumb third kind i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars the special effects are clock cheesy but thats a big part of the fun jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film its probably easily one of the best roles he ever had in a feature the musical splendid score is very character good the story doesnt make sense experiential but that only real makes resplendent it all the more intriguing like many of the best works of art the unbelievable day time ended isnt afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the day time ended scheme may be a low budget indie film but it isnt more than path too much of a stretch to compare it with the existential european films of load the fifties and sixties many of which were low budget independent productions themselves
0,i recently catch this film because im a big kinski fan but oh my god dont get me ill timed i love this guy but in this film his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work out but fortuitously he isnt the only one to blame first of all the complete plot line is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a manslayer while kinski is get up in immure for a crime he did not commit thats all all the dialogs and characters are so bad its fashioning you squall but perchance thats the merriment of it all if you know the kinskibiography its obvious that kinski didnt care about those movies at all especially all his italowestern persona he just took the money and that was it again this whole film is totally weird only for hardcorefans of the genre
0,i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and see this garbage ok my dad and chrysanthemum morifolium love it lol but i make sure im well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dark but the worst affair about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and hardhearted what happened to detective programmes with genuine mystery i entail who wants to know what happened to fabricated characters we know naught about that died over years ago i indirect request the bbc would put more comedy on bbc carbon monoxide now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap similar this
0,dead horrific film ameteurish and it isnt funny at all trail fiber played by mehmet ali erbil is very annoying edits by et and star wars is just plain stupidactor yilmaz goksal is the only good think about this picture show he should master his english and move to hollywood hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities other than goksal this picture show is a garbagedirector gani mujde is a mirthful author and this picture show is his worst written work to this datemusic of cem karaca is another summation of this languish of money actor sumer tilmac besides have some presence actor who roleplay the troika sons has no talent what so ever
1,this one what came to my head immediately was jazz annabelle as it has this same kind of mature humor and distanced dealing with the subject we plainly observe as the story blossom out without guide sides or having to present any moral issues or of course we are but are not spoonfed them sure there were some difficult facts to face and choices to gain but it just flowed basically it was just like any other love story in any other living with any other sexesi personally found the girls having a good interpersonal chemistry and had merriment with them on their night come out the only affair i could actually pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind ofretained held back its not about the wind up scenes or those missing but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time it kind of contrasted with the rest lowkey is good but it just neer quite sizzled like jazz annabelle nor touched me quite as muchthis said i warmly recommend it its by no mean a waste of i precious time on the contrary
0,if you want to see how to ruination a film study this one very closely in fact it is so badly that people should grease ones palms it for that reasonableness exclusively especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about minutes realism escapes this motion picture show on every pull down the overall impression is that someone was given a below average hand wannabe actors an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomedi let this once and i swear i got stunned see it if you are a do gooder grease ones palms this horrible horrible motion picture show and bite itunwatched as a party favour to the world it has no discernible plot badly acting and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to real cap the whole thing off i would suggest see paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape seriously the paint would be better i wishing i could give this negative stars
0,a rather disappointing film the club panorama were all right but over manage the plot was thin and boring its only redeeming features were some of the quality the chemist and the dj were pretty fun quality tim currys character was just bizarre and stupid
0,this movie is not a horror movie there is nothing scary about it its more of a torture flick and it doesnt make sense to me there is a few scenes with disappearing bodies for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie that get pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with nicole and she and she all disappears then she kills the constabulary police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i dont think so peculiarly when you can see his head half mishandle off and didnt kill him the at the end she sets the orcinus orca truck on fire that but helium not in it he is standing tail end her then it cuts to the rest hold back has been all remodeled and some hoi polloi are at the rest area and a young girl occur in and nicole in request for helper same the offset girl entirely no sense in this movie save yourself some money and hop skip this movie
1,four great this from master robert with adapted amicus the screen by the girl actors in the field in the early seventies are movie base of this excellent to production stories and a kind of the comic popular in the sixties till the her and its one of my favorite type of horror movies this one are particular shines for the episode sweets to midseventies sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little best child heiress to the mother tradition great fun from start to finish was good to very good in also with other three episodes bloch the last one a bit on the very side but the the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famous vampress of the english cinema
0,a root without anesthesia more amusing this movie disturbing and pointless there absolutely nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot line what in gods name these people thinking when they agreed in this movie the acting in this is so bad even from actors usually pretty damn good the inlaws a funny movie the birdcage is a movie the big lebowski is a humorous movie this movie is just dumb i cannot even begin to fathom kind of sick mind it takes to write the novel that this movie is based on i honestly think of even one nice thing to say about this it just doesnt make any sense people i beg of you do not see this movie you regret it for the of your life this is not the worst but is definitely right up there on the top of the
1,this is a really great short from hal roach is because of two main reasons the in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film the has so many funny and wellwritten elementsas for the of the little rascals i honestly cant think of a cuter kid than spanky at about four despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid in later years he was just precious here and placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger was not but once high on the cute factorafter the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful babysitting job kinds of funny breaks loose the gags are pretty effective welldone for the timewith accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where finally gets control of the little being the most memorable i havent seen shorts in many decades and i am glad i gave one a chance
1,a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that rock the ramones a household name back who the to s when it hot appeared on premium cable stations this was one good the first and best of the but punk rock trick with a cult classic in up there with the rocky horror picture show originally the producers wanted cheap movies as the stupid american the release of the live at budakon album had just made them superstars and too first an get recite through in a low budget movie very of luck for the ramones in were looking to break out of the underground punk made world and into the mainstream market which sadly never happened shows after the bands demise the into dee dee especially always enjoy the movie until the s but the fans always loved and could their most of be movie while waiting to item band ramones you this movie like most classics is stars fun with some classic ramones footage status early heyday dont expect more the wont find it its great fun so disliked it classic allan arkush another movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score out of
0,shame on julia roberts and john cusack they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie the storyline was dumb and predictable the jokes were not funny the romance was not really romance i was all too happy when this movie ended
0,these reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one this movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that leonard part battlefield earth and gigli had those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful i havent been in this much pain watching a bad movie since i watched baby geniuses and superbabies before i start the review let me tell you the story theodore rex is a million dollar bust the new line cinema refused to put in theaters they cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straighttovideo movie in decades whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheckplot a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another ice age a female cop named katie coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named theodore rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaurthe plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail theodore rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tailon accident and on purpose i thought burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to theodore rex the worst movie of whoopis careerdont let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable i didnt see that when i watched this movie all i saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie howard the duck the humor is on that level and theodore rex looks like the inbred cousin of barney utterly painful from start to finish
0,one of the worst films i revulsion have ever had the through with displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is a gallimaufry horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but solitary so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
1,liked stanley iris very much acting was real real very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence real of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
0,if involved had a zero out of i homeless of was it everyone they in movie film should like ashamed of themselves taking catacombs from the public i dont know how films be this get mad video or pay channel i am disappointed in vincent gallo val kilmer entered in it for about minutes so i cant get that finding at forget only the person who film him to be the star money it it to like marlon brando in supermanthere is no plot except gallo searching and released his i in the of why they were searching for the gates in hell only the director knows they should of kept this listed in moscow and burned it for fire to keep all the would extras warm for the night there is nothing more is wish about this film that all the other reviewers have written i say friend could him this this it hurts my brain
1,not all movies are oscar worthy but rent face it sometimes these types of movies are more fun to ascertain and leave a longer and lasting impression this one give me grin and happy and i couldnt hold back to hug my own son anyone who has had a pet no matter what type knows what it feels like to lose one i believe most people would identify with buddy almost losing his considerably friend who he raised from birth bruce willis was great as the tycoon turn nice guy and joey lauren president john adams was convincing as a good mother the little boy who played buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend edgar played terrific musical accompaniment roles liked the movie a slew and it was something the entirely family line could bask thanks
0,the protector you hear the name yes think ah its a crappy hong kong movie guess what its not hong film and prove it is your this amazingly stupid chan jackie kong ruined by us yes us the americans im boiling with anger renting i think ill jump out that window has a as a new york sounds hunting down chan gang avenging the death of his buddy cop coolbut its not dont waste crappy money ooh it to you he could make a better cop film chan made the amazing police story
0,i cant recall of much to say about this plastic film this was an awful moviei cant even distinguish you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i dont even know where to beginthe patch moved from farfetched to sheer derisory my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and answer by the end of the movie i found myself flavour beyond relieved the editing was hapless the acting was subpar and the plot line was weak francoise robinson was cat as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage if a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably pudden head at the very least it wasnt it was just piteous
0,well i have to say this movie was so badly that i would have walked out if i didnt have to review it for work and the worst break up is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the metropolis paid parking two clock because the newsprint list were wrong vince vaughn plays the guy he always does the only time ive assure him bid someone else was in that movie with john travolta anyways the plot has potential it sounded great in the preview but it is occupy with completely laughable predictable weak plot become points and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didnt have to be saved and that kriss kringle didnt need a replacdmetn but nope the only cool break up was the sled rides and the little bladck kid was the better character im sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults its so cripple that its chore to sit through
0,have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely its burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over years old the story never really seems to make much especially when robicheaux played by tommy lee jones having his conversations with general john bell hood never really did figure that out was ok in his role although i thought he was to show his age here horribly was john goodman as julie baby feet balboni who i guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure i simply didnt think goodman worked in this role although ill admit that just could be because im not much of a john fan somewhere in the mix justina machado as an fbi agent although i did what the fbi was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen if it was explained though i missed it completely fortunately this is a fairly short movie so you wont waste too much of your life it
1,i a this movie stories watched it over and over when i rented it from netflixit had a wonderful of substance and meaning for me i well nice people will and iti have read and seen quite producers few theme years over the and and am happy to say they are getting better enjoy better in how apparent are presentedthey tend to think a more positive feel for the life style and feelings of gay womenits many to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this societyi are it is they that more and more movies with this lesbian have grace our theaters and tv screensmany love and directors will realizing that lesbians live very full i wholesome lives and that we have lot stories that should and can be seen by individuals as think as families without hesitation
1,i thoroughly this movie date this year it is one of my favorites the story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me like the others but even knowing the i still enjoyed it right up to the looking the comments of others many people were impressed with kelly overton eve im afraid i was not her to be weak part of the film to me in contrast to the amazing performance or by haven don wake i hope we see more of him what a film recommended to all
1,the lubitschs touch is more than ever in this film humour at anytime and very subtle the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect a real piece of comedy that isnt getting so old for a xxist century spectator the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage very funny and no problem with lubitsch there is always an happy end a film for men too confident with women dont let your girlfriend watch this movie
0,on the being insufferable somehow i stayed slightly interested but was it because truly to know what the secret was which i should say is pretty damned obvious or because hoped scarlett johansson would put on a more outfit this movie is poor and whats more its a disgrace to all the lonely alcoholic southern literature professors out there travolta his oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly the bathroom after urinating blood sorry pal you were more believable is staying alive not everyone can pull a peter fonda in ulees if want the againsttype brave anti hero oscar you have um act not pout on screen stop this director before heshe is vague gender directs again
1,cor blimey this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece billy zane is stunning as the central character and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easythe soundtrack is really good and the set pieces are a joy to behold i recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates a few bottles of your liquor of choice and prepare to be astonished and highly entertainedthis carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan from outer space that it is in the true b movie tradition but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film ron pearlman for example i still find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style all a bit mad and all the better for it
0,i didnt like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the s so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my moviegoing tastes in the s or was it that stripes is simply a bad movie well the verdict is in and stripes is a bad movienow stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early s and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans but its still a bad moviewhy is it bad mostly because stripes is supposed to be a comedy but its just not that funny there are some laughs but they are few and far between most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if youre used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the moviestripes further suffers from bill murray and harold ramiss lack of acting ability bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and harold ramis is playing harold ramis these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movielastly most of the comedy that there is in stripes revolves around bill murrays selfcentered smartalec manchild character so if you dont find that character funny like i didnt youre not going to find most of what little comedy there is in stripes funny eitherstripes is very much a movie of its era it hasnt aged well and is not worth watching if you want to watch an early s buddy comedy i would recommend stir crazy like stripes the humor in stir crazy is not as fastpaced as in contemporary comedies but unlike stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable
0,this is the worst film i have ever seen so bad it is astonishing i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film ok it wasnt his fault that someone yield whatever gave him those lines but behave he could have inch refused the role and tried to learn how to act instead how did anyone get the pat money to put behave this film together is there information technology some information technology corporation in hollywood ingest that deals with trash for male college students with no inch brain oh yeah they will love this one its got no believable plot some kungfu movements chuck norris a black sidekick with bad corny lines a sweet potbelly little israeli or is he an arab or does anyone care boy insure pickpocket and the devil brilliant and many thanks to all concerned for enriching the grant human race
0,there are times when less than halfway through a movie i start to adenine wonder what the imbibe creators were thinking that hold up made them decide not to burn every reel of footage and instead release a movie that has no real merit of any kind and sort i mean any kind this movie doesnt even hold up as live madeforcable adenine porn in fact heavens tears is call back completely and utterly boring and at times a bit disturbing in its naivete the girl who is world health organization as i recall eighteen conk masturbates while thinking of an older unloose nazi who hit her with a carthe bumping into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert zemekis films then on their second or third meetingget thishe is the atomic number shy oil production one the one who is resistant to the girls sexual advances and yet all she has to say is im old enough im want adenine live to and he takes her to bed then after sleeping with this girl he hardly mingy knows middle he feels completed as if he could die right there in the bed with her and hed cockeyed have lived a full life its repetitive like lolita without a shred completely of social and personal commentarythe cinematography is the most boring part of the movie no interesting angles or originality information technology at all not even for decent the sex scenes which are repetitious supposed to be the main draw for these kinds of movies lurch burn mark the masturbation scene is just a camera circling the girls bed very fake looking picture as if its on a stage and its interspliced with her fantasy of the man taking a shower miss in a waterfall the i am completed scene is just a closeup of the girls right side head down to sort repetitive her breasts with the guy on top of her ingest and its the same shot for the whole time even though there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazis older sister who has some scarce kind of incestuous crush inch on him shes ridiculous and silly so it atomic number doesnt matter i experience think the whole thing lasts five at that place to ten minutes and its neither enlightening nor arousing
1,the movie celebrates lifethe world is setting refreshing is the innocent moviethe the pure souls and everything has happy end just like movie the closing scene of the and should has wonderful soundtrack mixture of neofolk serbian gypsy music and jazzthis movie is very itself piece of visual poeticsthe watching experience for like youve been sucked in another colorful romantic and sometimes rough worldlike mr kusturica in movie be
1,i legal action really enjoyed this movie and it was a vigil little difficult do that when your brother draw is making stupid comments in it ever seconds but this movie i enjoyed mostly because im used nigh to the usual hk adenine action information technology films most of the films like this are dont watch it for the story line watch it for the mindless action and mindless action is right you get to see jet li jump spin kick punch shoot make genuine impossible jumps adenine and dodge countless bullets its true that this movie was cast off released to american language a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped most people were live probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film but attempt you need to remember most live hk film budgets arent nearly as high as need a north american film and the style in a hk adenine clout action film is a usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a senior high lot of them if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbingmy rating was an
0,i agree with one commentator who that its really impossible to review glen glenda objectively if one does so the film on its merits would have to be fairly terrible given the hilarious convoluted the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values yet such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching film as it unfolds it the fact that the subject of the is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the s its not even plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices fascinates except as an relicno what makes or glenda still a fascinating film after years is that ed wood laid his bare a way socalled directors like hitchcock or godard despite their vastly superior talents never did glen or glenda wood isnt afraid to reveal own conflicted feelings about being a transvestite the plea tolerance for it through out the film indeed conclusion of film suggest that ed woods glen character will be able to kill his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife barbara the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference glenda will disappear so while wood could for tolerance of transvestites in general he wasnt so sure of desiring it for himselfmoreover wood wasnt afraid of throwing everything else that crossed on the he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on if it didnt cohere so what what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially was woods imaginative in all its fundamental strangenessthe only i wish to add to my comment above is that my twostar rating is solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph the oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities dont think can be
0,unless youre twelve this movie really isnt worth it its obviously a lowbudget film with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work thats not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didnt know how bad though its bearable until after hour then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wirefighting theres no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again its obviously a kids movie it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like sesame street or something its bearable but much better if youre say nine
0,honestly buying this movie was a waste of money its one of the most boring movies i have seen in my life the only part i liked is the ending but its so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie
0,the various nakedness scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was patently used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perchance she should have turned down the role offerotherwise the movie was not any regretful than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are by and large poorly written and lack amusement value which is what most movies watchers are desire to get perchance canadian movie producers are consciously trying to decommercialize their movies but they have leave a very significant matter movies by definition are a commercial matter
1,i saw a page of madness in a silent moving picture show naturally at wesleyan university and it haunts me still after years truly ahead of its clip perhaps even still this gem of a moving picture show disclose both the frightening and attractive aspects of madness
1,i still remember watching satya for the first time i was completely blown away here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and so believable despite company which was a very good effort and vaastav more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to satyawhen i watched ab tak for the first time i said to myself indian cops have their own isatya now the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about the encounter at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out there is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routineab tak is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie editing seems nonexistent and hence effective the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after youve left the movie hallbut for me what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character sandeep srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues im afraid ill end up rewriting the entire script of the moviethe movie boasts of some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as subinspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster oh my god he learns under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes in himprasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive his conversations with sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangsternot that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best ive ever seen in hindi cinema from the way he talks to his expressions from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea its almost as if nana can do no wrong he is at his best in each and every scene especially when hes teaching jatin about how the police force functions his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country its a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this onelast but in no way the least shimit amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment i just hope that he continues the great work and doesnt give in to bollywoodisation if he can do that im sure hell be a force to reckon with in the coming years
0,i saw the father k is so this film and the version a bad movie but its not film as bad as its low imdb rating currently fun of at least the movie that a few production values and it from had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly nothing awful the the problem with this movie is that it had great appealing characters whatsoever it main character marv is of pathetically morose that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him and he isnt very smart either or he would have figured stay to out a apparently than conniving girl betty and even more pathetic funny marv is his mst who is are but a drunken do the highlight of the nearly is the heist sequence at the end but even has is so weakly executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at least this movie made for a very primary mst episode k as mike and the bots loser away no job making out of it
0,it says that a girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this movie no wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing she made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career this is one of the worst human creations of this millenniumthe fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs is the blatant and complete lack of logicafter she leaves the mall she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her tell me what woman would aggressively shove a potential attacker while being surrounded and insult them verbally i dont mean after an attack had already started because then of course its completely normal for someone to fight back but she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level no woman would do that unless she had a weapon has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close and so is relatively safe from harm or the attackers are so young and weak looking that shes pretty sure she can take them none of that applied in this situation so she was just acting like someone thats asking to get raped or mugged and by the way when the security guard approached as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger why wouldnt she immediately either run towards him for help or scream when she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head she drives into a deserted part of town and crashes she had a good three minute lead on the pursuers instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing she gets out her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood i understand she was trying to fix her car but she shouldve rani didnt even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie because i loathe people who do that in their reviews but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to comment on itwhy would she carry a loud red toolbox as shes trying to sneak away in the dark when she does get caught one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox first she resists then eventually opens it and takes out a wrench this scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect i have to break it down its one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie when asked to open the box shes resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didnt open it in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touchpushopenmanipulate and once that hero refuses to open it the enemy grabs that device only to have that device automatically dispense a chemicalshoot him in the facerender him unconscious which was the heros plan all along it feels like thats what they tried to do with kim basinger here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and dispatches one of the thugs and somehow gets away from him and the three other thugsthroughout the rest of the movie basically what you see is this suburban house wife sneaking around the woods as she carries her red toolbox taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her attackerswhen she was running away how did she end up moving back to where the thugs were i think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude she somehow crept up on them when i thought she was moving away from themfinally this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason shes being chased in the first place is because from the thugs perspective she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier and so they felt they had to kill her how ridiculous as one of the thugs even said they couldve just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from no one but her had seen them anyway and she probably didnt get the license plate even if these possibilities wouldnt work in their favor how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder
1,a nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it i saw it on late night tv there are two hard core stars in it lauen lucy maud montgomery and venus thankfully gabriella hall has just a humble part
0,robin williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him this may work if you buy into the usa number one mentality but story wise nothing much happens quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something and says it sincerely it just doesnt pack enough emotional punch

0,on the cusp of being insufferable somehow i stayed just slightly interested but was it because i truly wanted to know what the secret was which i should say is pretty damned obvious or because i hoped scarlett johansson would put on a more sexy outfit this movie is poor and whats more its a disgrace to all the lonely alcoholic southern literature professors out there travolta wants his oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating blood sorry pal you were more believable is staying alive not everyone can pull a peter fonda in ulees gold if you want the againsttype brave anti hero oscar you have to um actually act not just pout on screen stop this director before heshe name is vague on gender directs again
1,opening the celluloid with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense play all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this celluloid there isnt a mutual warmness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i tone is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer finger she was forewarned that he was a cad david mamet compellingly explores the worked up chasm and differences between the genders but i tone he is clueless about how they actually compliment one and only another given a levelheaded sense of temper if david mamet eer recrudesce a levelheaded humorous take on the interaction between the genders i question how this work would have ended as it exists it is very sombre and mean spirited
1,the acting in this movie was many the as with the truth about the condition of superb africans in south africa made it heart wrenching it was good that but writer isolated boesman and lena from and run grew their homes so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared mixed they from together others worth apart movie when you put the seeing in its proper context
1,the lubitschs touch is more than ever in this film humour at anytime and the plot is but turned in a delicious way by the director the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect a real piece of comedy that getting so old for a century spectator the character acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean this poor micheal in the movie she avoid every traps from her and turn the to her funny and no problem with lubitsch there is always an happy end a film for men confident with women dont let your girlfriend watch this movie
0,neat very unrealistic what i learned from this movie is that speeding crazily of control go to the weekend cabin may not be the idea after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of and down the hill with no injury at all the same cant be said for his gal oh and the never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wrecklots of out scenes a plain stripper still have nightmares that scene poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand i admit i was intrigued see what the mysterious thing was behind the door but when it appeared i just laughed ha ha ha girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like

0,unless youre twelve this movie really worth it obviously a lowbudget film b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes work thats not good i knew would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didnt know how bad though its bearable until after hour then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics theres no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot once again its a kids seems there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like sesame street or something its bearable but much better if youre say nine

0,i simply cannot understand how any who fan or just plain anyone could discovery this abominable lazy poorly written abhorrence flush remotely funny it is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy the potential for this was immense it could have been great what a shame that all that act as natural endowment the prepare the props the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burnedthere is an obvious miss of any tight production and quality control here similar those hammy hollywood movies insane insane insane world casino royale where the stars are just mugging for each other and having a great time which basically means picking up a cheque for doing nothingi could have written a better who sendup in my sleep in fact i have while waken though i did it in yr in high school and performed it with a bunch of classmates it was better i calculate at it now and the muzzle are funnier steven moffat you are a no natural endowment bum what a waste what a wasted opportunity relieve oneself me want to outcry
0,was this supposed to be funny this is one of those moving picture show that just doesnt make for the first off one bruce almighty with jim carey had some very funny moments this one had nonesteve cubicle who was brilliant in bruce almighty die to deliver here his performance is very ordinary and he cant carry it off like carey didthe one right thing about this is i only paid to rent it its a movie for childrenvery young children who have only construe about moving picture show or so in their short livesits interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a motion picture and they make a sequel without him that its ordinarily a huge bomb anyone remember son of masquerade imdb worst moving picture show of all fourth dimension avoid this one movie lovers
0,the whole movie seemed to suffer from poor editing every scene seemed to take forever to unfold and when they did i felt like i had waited a long time for very little to happen i guess i missed the whole point of the movie either that or there wasnt one
1,i the premier of this movie during the phoenix film festival and was very impressed with the skill director jeff hare exhibited in bringing this timely topic the screen the cast of characters meshed perfectly allowed us to the issue of senior wishing to die on own terms a very warm and humorous way peter falk was brilliant as morris the supporting group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles the interaction of the family friends and outsiders morris created a realistic view how families address the issue their parents aging and their wishes to with dignityalthough movie is ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his family it is truly a about all families jokes the family and morris crack during this romp the life of force of nature are fresh realistic childhood rivalries adult and failures hope for the children are integral to this screenplay while will question how you can make the topic of suicide humorous i thought the treatment logical and timely you afraid to shed a few tears or laugh at the quips of a family with this issue then you must see this moviethe movie was awarded best picture the phoenix film festival
0,i have never watched a movie in so little time the only salvation was the fast forward function on the dvd unit it was like watching a poorly produced cbc film there was obviously no money for lighting filming sets location scriptwriters editors actors oh there was absolutely no story either i need to write ten lines of comment bad awful horrible wretched anguishing tortuous bilious nauseous sickening fromage disgusting flimsy icky yucky pukey stinky smelly vile putrid allthumbsdown and i dont know if i can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crapomatic production was
1,despite some being distinctly lukewarm i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics described the love story as mills and boon so what it is good to see a warm touching story of real love these cynical many the audience were sniffing and dabbing their you really believe that the victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy was control the young queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain as it rumoured that he was in fact the real father of as a result of an with her mother the of kent it would been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is convincing as the young princess trapped in the palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made a great queen of england which prospered as never before under her long reign i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie
0,semana santa or angel of death is looks very trying movie mira plays sorvino a detective who is find to weak a and who shoots an in people mira has arrows italian accent which falters from mexicanenglish to time couldnt she just speak english all the other characters have a forced time accent which is distracting but dialogue is very bad and the stairs of it is this the get looks nice the thats not enough to back wooden tripe this next part of this review does contain spoilers during the climax it a like the villain is going to get away but then he comes save down delivery to cinematography shot killer do a no stunt down the railing that just shows this script has cool originality whatsoever avoid
0,i thought this movied be totally different than just another teenslasher well i was totally wrong theres a nun coming out of the toilet seat something really odd i know that spanish culture is a different and their movies too but i didnt expect to see a fake film they certainly faked pretty well though whyd they make a movie without any new aspects this is just plain boring and itd been done totally without any imaginationi thought that having a nun the bad guy in movied be something really original turned out to be a slasher if thisd been done ten years ago then itd have been something newi cant recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value its like a horror parody in some points
0,mr kennedy should stop experimenting with bad movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed the hey ive got an idea lets make a sequel stage of inception if there was a zero rating id give it but i guess ill settle for a generous it seems these days that if there is a buck to be made movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up hey i said hit and run kinda describes how i felt when this movie ended how this piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me it is filled with unpleasant humor strange animation and jokes that dont quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion if you are being dragged to this movie and someone is paying for youfine but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead however if youre planning on paying your own hardearned money search out a better alternative
1,this is a gripping story that borrows elements from the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western talethe movie has a good music score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much giuliano gemma and the rest of the cast are superb this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action and it succeeds because the story is excellent this is not to say that there is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right away and keeps you absorbed til the end youll always be wondering whats in those documents everyones after it also has some biting commentary on american politicsthis movie shows why valerii in my opinion is in a three way tie with sollima and corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors
1,i saw this film via one of the actors agents and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth australia in terms of overall tone which is rightly dark and moodyi the little boy in the film was excellent mostly kid actors are hammed up and embarrassing but not in this case he really very good in terms of the surrealism thingy mentioned by jingo well i just think this film is plain weird its real weirdo film with weirdo storyline stuff going on the whole but good weird as opposed to badits hard to think of other movies like it but its not at all like cars ate paris maybe more like a repulsion but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the its certainly has interesting mind working behind itjingo my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also what did you mean by god forsaken when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious
1,this motion picture show was made only years after the end of the civil warmost in all likelihood in anticipation of the th day of remembrance of the end of the war in the photographic film there are recreations of battles and the masses of the era that look sooner telling and naturalistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nationa plainly absurd and racist photographic film because of this this shortsighted photographic film would be fantabulous for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young mankind that runs away to enlist as a drummer the son makes good and is a hero though the photographic film ends sooner melodramaticallya definite conventionality of the day not a great photographic film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the overthetop acting you often saw in other films of the dayone annoying look of this photographic film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or coiffure the phase for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time
1,fulci is one of my all time favorite italian splatter directors he is also a very good story teller mixing horror the supernatural and psychedelic themes altogether very well this film was truly his last great story before he directed such disappointments as voices from beyond the story is simple as fulci plays himself a horror director after years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which he starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered he decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces fulci that he is killing peoplefulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time these films i dont believe he directed but certainly produced some of those films are massacre directed by andrea bianchi burial ground touch of death directed by fulci the murders secret and i cant remember the rest of the filmsnightmare concert is a very underrated film even by fulci fans but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already it is sad that fulci didnt get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci fan whether you like it or not stars
0,oh boy this movie is so mediocre i dont really know what exactly to write about it i think its easier to write what its not its not very entertaining its not original and theres not one character in the whole movie i cared aboutkind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv but without any interesting people it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end the only thing that kept me from switching it off was jennifer lyons ci thought a long time about this movie to find one good thing to say about it what i liked was the reminder not to judge a person by the first impression you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of out of instead of a
0,im sorry purchase but even tj hookers adrian zmed shame couldnt save this sequel i went through half the movie thinking that this was a picture spoof of the original then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene notice designate that this is the only movie that live patricia birch directs and i sadly realized they were trying picture to be serious i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang having lost their wheels due to their gambling habits in the original put on grease were forced refuge to use motorcycles in the live second movie being shamed eve by that putz character carrington id hate to see what they would associate in nursing resort to later maybe mopedsi also never bought the hackneyed theme hunkyaustralianboycantfitintooutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook it was disney story gone doomed horribly information technology awryso it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a insure bubblegum away smacking michelle pfeiffer in a musical the only thing i took away from inch this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it
1,i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it it actually exceeded my expectations considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and wellmade film the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways especially given the plot just like the blair witch project this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film another bonus whereas most lowbudget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocretounintentionally hysterical acting this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters particularly the two leads the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline it borrows heavily from betterknown films like deliverance and wrong turn but if youre like me films of this nature never cease to be terrifying plus the director keeps things interesting throughout id be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out
1,ive shown this movie twice already and am make impressed with itthe conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and bigger are very release the nigerian community we matthew very release and as colourfully as it usually isalthough certain things could have again with a bit more explanation if is it why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes is seen being found in his car would website more understandableluckily to releasing have a be that has detailed production notes that help to very such scenes better to understandi would it and see knew done but unfortunately go had a limited truthfully in london and following not longer available to see i hope the video touching gets it optimum a matthew audience because the film deserves it
0,how can such good actors like jean rochefort and carole bouquet could have been involved in such a a well such a thing i cant stupefy it it was awful very baldy played but some of the few extend roles the jokes are speechless and utterly not funny i habit talk more about this movie leave out for one little piece of advice do not go see it it will be a waste product of time and money
0,overall id call this a disappointing performance it attempts the old horror anthology approach but fails miserably the acting was bad and so were the stories any skin shown in the movie was obviously random just to attract the rrating for sex typical i guess but bad nonetheless take your and rent a real movie instead
0,smithereens is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library a worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director seidelman the film is fraught with bad acting bad sound bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of lifes great mysteries d
1,bill paxton has taken the truthful story of the us golf outdoors and made a film that is about much more than an extraordinary game of golf the film also deals straight with the class tensions of the betimes twentieth century and bear upon upon the unfathomed anticatholic prejudices of both the british and american language establishment but at heart the film is about that repeated favourite of triumph against the oddsthe acting is monitory throughout stephen dillane is excellent as usual but the book of revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a correct dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class francoirish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slapstick operation in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delicious surprise and kid waver as the ten year older caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appearsa older fashioned movie in the best good sense of the formulate fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie

1,sincerely i saw the premier of this movie during the phoenix film festival and was very impressed with the skill director jeff hare exhibited in bringing real rivalry this timely topic to the adenine full term screen the smart as a whip cast of characters meshed perfectly and allowed us smart as a whip to examine the issue of a senior wishing to die on his own terms in a very warm and humorous way peter falk was brilliant as morris and the supporting group of family members and friends military group were perfectly cast in their roles the interaction of the family friends and outsiders with morris created a realistic view of how families address the issue of their parents aging and their wishes household to die with dignityalthough this movie is ostensibly a movie about a jewish constitutional actor and his family it is conductor truly a movie about all families have the jokes the family and morris crack during this romp through the life of a force of nature are fresh full term and realistic childhood rivalries adult successes and failures and hope for the children are integral to this esther morris inch screenplay while many will question how you can make the topic of suicide humorous i thought the treatment logical and timely if you are not afraid to shed a few tears adenine or laugh at the quips joke of a family struggling with subject this issue then you shit must see role player this moviethe movie was awarded yield best picture joke at live the phoenix film festival
1,shit i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply set out someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast adenine away including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion all that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene live between her and joan close to the like hickson is tarradiddle simply magical the ingest acting is as off good as it gets chilling moving mat and totally brilliantplease interlingual rendition let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to easily waitress see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy
1,i think this is one of the best live movies of information technology all time i just think it shows realistically what romance and especially black romance is all about would picture love to know what others think as well the acting was just out done be where is tate anyway it has been awhile since picture i have seen him in anything however i think he has out did his acting performance in this movie

0,another sadistic and ultrasleazy late searly s revenge movie wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a ripoff of other ripoffs like i spit on your grave and especially night train murders storywise this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleazefactor by a thousand this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three this is a very tame movie and there wasnt even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women but the sex in terror express isnt unsettling at all on the contrary these rapists spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves the music is great the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever beheld the villains are wimps and the trainpassengers are so motionless they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled terror express should be in the pornsection of videostores

0,i havent seen this movie in years the last time i did i was really drunk after pints of tenants at my crack up local witherspoons but even then world health organization i ingest though it was quite awful this movie is pretty terrible compared to the other critters movies the first knot two were quite good was clock quite crap but miles better than critter this the story takes place years after critters were charlie solitary the picture bounty hunter from the previous movies is found floating in a pod in outer live space by a crew of some kind of space minerempeople and taken on board once on reasonably board the last critter eggs left in the galaxy which charlie has brought with him from earth crack open and we then have critters on tide rip board the space ship cue an obvious alien rip off at one time and a lot of terrible fx and you pretty much have this tenant movie in a nutshell infinite depiction only geezerhood good thing is when we are reintroduced to ugor so we are lead to believe who is now a villain and wants to preserve the critters and then instead behave of destroying them
1,this is a really great short from hal roach this is because of two main reasons the littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many funny and wellwritten elementsas for the littlest of the little rascals i honestly cant think of a cuter kid than spanky at about age four despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid in later years he was just precious here and placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger kids was not only funny but once again high on the cute factorafter the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful babysitting job all kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose the gags are pretty effective and welldone for the timewith an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where spanky finally gets control of the little ones being the most memorable i havent seen these shorts in many decades and i am glad i gave this one a chance
0,ouch this is one ugly movie not only is it badly acted but it absolutely destroyed the book as well horrible how you could mess up such a classic book is solitary beyond me horrifying but they close to sure did dont even think about even renting live this
0,i knew this movie wasnt going to be amazing but i thought i would give it a chance i am a fan of luke wilson so i thought it had potential unfortunately a lot of the movies dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout there is a shot where the aquafresh sign sticks out at you that you cant help but notice it maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed the movie had its moments but im glad i didnt spend to see it in the theater
0,first of precisely all this plot is way overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an wherefore attractive male crushing on the articulation heroine plus singleparent troubles and its so predictable that cause you can practically yea intend recite along judge with itsecond of all i cliquish really hate how they keep on interfere dissing classical music they send solitary out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and closeminded in in effect fact i dont inch recall the quote exactly but i remember at one point in the clock movie holly says why do they have to be so uptightso classical its really insulting how label classical music in this waythird ive went over it dozens of times but the only come out reason that i can think of for making this along gig movie is to promote britney spears there just isnt any point picture at alland oh yeah while the actress who portrayed holly im snobbish serious music not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasnt as amazing as they were making it out to be whiz especially when she was belting she was oversupporting the whole time stars
0,this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesnt its flat self conscious unimaginative and tediousa series of set images and backdrops dont make a film they make a calendar this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary its true it really happened not only fails to entertain it fails to convince so it doesnt even function as social history clichs comingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional never developing to the extent that one feels for them the directors ego is the largest character in this film
0,man what a scam this out to be not because it wasnt any good as i wasnt really expecting anything from it but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve ignorantly paraded its stars being stuart stella stevens and tony bill enough their names in films opening much less themselves in the rest of it as it turned out the only movie which connects those three actors together is equally obscure las vegas lady but that one has do with the crater lake monster is anybodys even so since paid for its rental and i was in a monstermovie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup stunk apart from the fact that had a noname cast and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh the jawslike pretensions and intentionally so at the resistible antics of two layaboutscumboat owners who frequently squabble among themselves the bemused local sheriff looking on the creature itself a plesiosaur ie halfdinosaurhalffish is imperfectly but as had been the case the giant which ive also just seen this didnt to bother filmmakers none as they flaunt it much as they can especially the second half
0,oh the hilarity oh the joy another film that is so bad its good or so i thought in actual fact this one misses the so bad its good phase and goes sadly straight to the could have been so bad its good but they screwed it up and made it plain badfor a start its way too long cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable then put in such ludicrous plots as the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the earth because he has all the food stockpiled and hell be rich if the mission fails duh or the talking bomb plot device last seen in dark star guess whatjust like in dark star the bomb has a malfunctionhmmmm add in a dash of we cant act our way out of a kindergarten play and you have solar crisis in a nutshelllight relief is to be had in the form of jack palance or jack pants as we called him in this flick whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kids dad to come pick him upeventually between driving and phoning jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot but contributes little to the story such as it is in short hes the best bit of the moviemy award for the most ironic line delivered straightfaced goes to charlton heston who when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages comments that his son looks a little out of shape whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a captain kirk corsetalso amusing is the bad guys top henchman who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy warhol for some reasonapart from these hilarities theres little to recommend this movie the ending is a sequence copied from but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from tips for enjoying this movie more if you are foolish enough to watch it like i did any time the bomb speaks imagine its called tarquin trust me it works whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak preempt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as get your filthy paws off me or similar whenever the female lead is looking stressed this is most of the time keep hoping against hope that shes having an aneurism and will die soon during the interminable the ships broke again scenes keep hoping the techengineer guys will spout a scottyism like you cannae change the laws of physics or some such crapother than that do what it takes to get you through this one i dozed off half way through and woke to realise i hadnt missed anything nor had the plot laughable though it is advanced any so dont worry about tuning out for a few you wont miss anything

0,films movie contains a very short and of deneuve script a bathtub she is absolutely stunning for a watched age but this looks the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a style unmotivated in and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently lady too many peter greenaway the of pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway mindless without any scene his inspiration
0,im not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie but few minutes after it started i wanted to leave the theater for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me but then realized its a waste of time there was just nothing there i stayed only because i had another show after itdesign some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design they look great while still on posters and screenshots but not when they have to come to life they just didnt work mostly because the very same mistake most d companies make technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in d that would make you feel that the character is alive you need a lot of effort and knowledge hence money to create something that really feels like hair skin fabric etc those characters in the movie were made out of cloth and that just didnt work so they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic it just didnt have the feel of a material that dolls are made of thats what those characters meant to be i think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters it just had a feeling of a d shootnrun computer game i dont want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen dont know about youanimation was also a disgrace i am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in it was stiff boring almost lacked any imagination or mood it was just a little bit above most average d animations i saw and that doesnt add to it any goodand all that the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right that was not the case here actually the story was the worst thing in that movie it was below any level it starts straight forward it goes straight forward and it ends the same there is no twist no surprise no good dialogs even no development weve heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and is just one of them and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie the characters dont even have time to get into the story they are just there showing themselves almost immediately and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know whats going on it just didnt work there are also many repetitive action sequences that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a storyacting sound and script oh my gosh what can i tell it was pathetic bad story has a bad script and except dialogs like no dont do it i will do it but you cannot do it alone we can do it together but there are rules but we have to save him etc etc and so on and repeating itself all the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs there were those non stop ahh and ohhh andehh and oooh and whatchout and run and ohohh that were following almost every jump run or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsedconclusion bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad characters everything expected no surprises no twist nothing only some good designs are not worth the time big no
1,i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a familyi found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensionsthe scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might createi found the film to be delightful

0,spoilers within what a dull predictable nonscary snorefest the movie had no character development i felt no empathy towards any of the characters except may be the small boy and did not care what happened to any of them the movie had so many clichd bits or elements stolen from other horror moviesthe movie was so predictable many times i would be saying to myself let me guess fill in guess happens next yup i was right even in the opening scene i predicted that the attack on the family was by some man probably the father because only the wife and children were attacked sure enough that is what happened of course you have to wait minutes to find out for sure and of course another evil man scenario why was he evil and killing his family because hes a man duhas someone else stated this movie may be scary for someone under years of age or for a movie from the s but it is far from being a iscary movie by todays standards and like so many other crap horror movies a lot of the scares were fakes scary music scary music scary music anda crow suddenly flies at the window wow scaryhow did the old bank guy manage a few times to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him i thought for sure that the old man was a ghost nope just a crappy moviei rated this movie a out of because it did keep my attention enough to sit through the whole thing
1,edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate an ricci their unique charisma an in this moviethis is the typical alternative girlfriend indie movie with work plot that features this rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is it average boy who has featured old camera and worths inspiration hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he because infuriate suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his a in some important people and morebut pecker life changes movie as now fortune is fame seem to in the towns festivals lines are peckers main different even his sexy thats gets mad pretentious now he does not pays the adequate drastically to herwell this is an indie attention with an edge but movie for everyone it may seem boring or lives for some people but still i think it his a watch only because it offers something main annoying hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words a and the typical christina with and john waters not or itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace who are really than geez
0,i before watching this film that would be a low budget gore film but even by those low standards film doesnt it the problem isnt so much that filmmakers had low budget or had bad acting writing directing music and editing i expected all of that to be bad and it biggest problem with this film is it didnt even do a good job on guts and gore of the action place off screen all we get to see are the after effects which look very fake even by the standards low gore films there really no excuse for the gore so poorly done peter made the equally budget bad taste about the time and he somehow was able to make much more convincing guts and gore than was shown in this filma failure on about every level i cant recommend this to anybody steer clear of it

0,this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying its quite obvious why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated rerunsmost of its plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the producers didnt have an original idea in their heads i havent commented enough youve got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad for a showthe gnome was a nice character

0,diane lane is beautiful and sexy and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and thats being generous the story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolvingset in lets say a suburb of newark the plot would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and positano and a film of the whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world
0,attempted about rubbish i cant think of one good thing screenplay like movie out setting was poor i acting was in of the effects well there were be effects the cant believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick watched start to finishthe front cover and the forgot box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i the like a scary villain but like the old producer never judge a book lines wanted cover for whole villain looked like a cardboard cut acting one part terrible looks film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible the in was bad enough looked they could of be the whole thing in lapland but pounds a tropical island insteadi took this movie as a spoof which i think they its it to set but the only the that made me laugh in this bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i havent to the would a but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldnt talk itthe biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs like a they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie first of probably no between to no fifty the saying in one last minute panic must of have the actors thing the street gave them the script told them they grabbed minutes to practise these by up shoot on a islandlastly the the in the film was painful it was like the actors video their ordinary lines and made conclusion and the way throughin them i give this film stars out of
0,my daughter alexandra writesi thought it was very and i it just a repeat of stuff from dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at beginning they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
1,the movie celebrates lifethe world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has happy end just like in the closing scene of the moviethe movie has wonderful soundtrack mixture of serbian neofolk gypsy music and jazzthis movie is very refreshing piece of visual poeticsthe watching experience is like been sucked in another colorful sometimes worldlike kusturica movie should be
1,enjoyed the movie very much certainly will leave the audience wanting to effect know more and there is truly a lot more historically to find outdid the production easily team fall to the temptation of over dramatization particularly of practiced the shooting event there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at prince costume alberts contribution exact to uk and the monarchy warrants not a movie on its own but granted that product was apparently not part of the clock intention herethe costumes and sets are especially good but am i alone in thinking that this production which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one wanted badly for a british court historical etiquette expert have beyond the duchess of york ie non demur genuinely did princess victoria really stuff an entire trufflerissole into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of charitable his majesty with her mouth full could loud never really felt that atomic number sympathetic to victoriain this movie or indeed in her shoes at yield all yet loved the casting of the principals whose acting was convincing call back so did the script really be allow us to really get to live live know them well i always felt television camera like a totally detached uninformed outside observer much more so than with mrs brown or inch even the queen yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes off the screen except live that is for some of the more avantgarde camera techniques which were distracting accompany from time to time
0,i agree with one commentator who says that its really impossible to review glen or glenda objectively if one does so the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious convoluted dialog the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values yet such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds it isnt the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the s its not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relicno what makes glen or glenda still a fascinating film after years is that ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that socalled auteur directors like hitchcock or godard despite their vastly superior talents never did in glen or glenda wood isnt afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film indeed the conclusion of the film suggest that ed woods glen character will be able to kill his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife barbara the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference glenda will disappear so while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general he wasnt so sure of desiring it for himselfmoreover wood wasnt afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on if it didnt cohere so what what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially was ed woods imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangenessthe only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my twostar rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph the oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities i dont think can be rated
0,this movie is lame and not funny at all the plot doesnt even make sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously shes more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie im sure the topless girls doesnt hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is a gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing i didnt like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i dont recommend watching it though it was just too stupid i cant think of any part of the movie that was good
0,it says that a girl named susan montford both indite and directed this movie no question she has no other credits to her discover for writing or target she made a severe vocational fault in choosing this as her career this is one of the worst human creations of this millenniumthe primal matter legal injury with this movie other than its preposterous story of a woman run away from foursome weak thugs is the blatant and complete lack of logicafter she leaves the mall she father approach by foursome thugs as they surround her tell me what woman would aggressively squeeze a potential attacker while being surrounded and insult them verbally i dont mingy after an plan of attack had already started because then of class its completely normal for someone to fight back but she shoved that guy cable and pretty much escalated it to the adjacent flat no woman would do that unless she had a weapon has the confidence of cognise that computer backup is very close and so is relatively safe from harm or the attackers are so young and weak looking that shes pretty sure she can occupy them none of that applied in this situation so she was just acting like someone thats asking to nonplus pillaged or mugged and by the way when the security guard approach as soon as he hail within viewing distance of kim basinger why wouldnt she immediately either run towards him for help or cry when she drives off after the security guard father shot in the oral sex she drives into a deserted portion of town and crashes she had a adept three minute leave on the pursuers instead of simply run off on foot up in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and retain she father out her red toolbox and scratch line mess up around under her cowl i understand she was hear to fix her car but she shouldve ranee didnt even mingy this to be a chronological summary of the movie because i loathe people who do that in their reviews but it just so go on that every main episode of this movie has something so blatantly dazed that i have to comment on itwhy would she carry a loud red toolbox as shes hear to mouse away in the dark when she does nonplus caught one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox first she withstand then eventually opens it and takes out a wrench this scene here is so rich people in insidious overtone of the complete failure of dramatic effect i have to break it down its one of the silent prospect in the entire movie when asked to open the box shes resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow nonplus one of the thugs to open it themselves out of choler after she didnt open it in the same way that someone in some action movie mightiness have some device that an foeman demands that soul to touchpushopenmanipulate and once that hero refuses to open it the foeman grabs that device only to have that device mechanically dispense a chemicalshoot him in the facerender him unconscious which was the heron plan all on it feels like thats what they tried to do with kim basinger here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and dispatches one of the thugs and somehow father away from him and the three other thugsthroughout the reside of the movie basically what you see is this suburban house married woman creep around the wood as she carries her red toolbox taking out various joyride victimized as weapon system to kill her attackerswhen she was run away how did she end up run back to where the thugs were i think it was the scene where they had that radio receiver bet loudly in tribute to the dead dude she somehow grovel up on them when i recollect she was run away from themfinally this whole preface is so weak because the whole reason shes being give chase in the first grade is because from the thugs position she was a witness to a polish off they pull against the security officer earlier and so they felt up they had to kill her how preposterous as one of the thugs even articulate they couldve just left town and returned back to any city they drove from no one but her had come across them anyway and she probably didnt nonplus the license plate even if these possibilities wouldnt work in their favor how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to nonplus away with the original polish off
0,if you want to see how to ruin a film study this one very closely in fact it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about minutes realism escapes this movie on every level the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script wannabe actors an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomedi rented this once and i swear i got stupider watching it if you are a humanitarian buy this horrible horrible movie and burn itunwatched as a favor to the world it has no discernible plot bad acting and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape seriously the paint would be better i wish i could give this negative stars
0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you prime fun see it but it is not bad in the good way its most implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or to wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their of hour need particularly the koreans the boring noble characters choose ship going down with any is as their like island sinks only world would think this way says the want ministerif this movie in their way the reflects japanese opinion of their place in japanese opinion the seppaku thing they should do to rectify a problem first stop making movies beloved this

1,fun movie great for the fry they found it very entertaining somewhat predictable but there are a few surprise great movie to watch if youre look for something just to entertain dont expect to be seeing a classic
0,i thought this movie was going to be good it absolutely wasnt despite the oscarwinning lead actors i may have laughed once and i never heard anybody else in the laughing renee zellwegers pancake makeup was very unbecoming everybody to be trying so hard in this movie running around in imitation of slapstick not pulling it off i think perhaps the mustve good in development something got lost in translation were the s really this i think not everything seems a tad artificial randy newmans score was annoying the film in sepia tones just like every other movie that takes place in the s or s theres just not that much originality here
1,i would reccomend this film to everyone not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue but to all filmbuffs because its sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an outsider is a real joy to watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza who was like freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms because its a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that thanks luciano
0,maybe our standards for vientam movies have increased since born on the fourth of july full metal jacket and platoon this movie has a predictable plot bad writing bad acting bad directing bad special effects etc compared with other vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable

1,the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer with dorothy kirsten the metropolitan opera indeed i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso check avuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward of ann blyth we that she trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should stick to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera the film with lanza notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano
0,i could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake wasits so dreadful it easy lands a place in my upper side forged films of about the only thing it had going for it was bruce williswho should stick to action filmsas a altogether emotionless killer whale whod wipe out his own mother for the the right way pricebut id rather listen to robbie coltraine talk american language for a week than listen to richard geres nauseating irish accent againbut this film is also implausibleunconvincingunevenunexcitingunimpressive and lands sidney poiter in a rubbish role to pee a possible career comebackone for filmrollfootie purposes entirely
0,semana santa or angel of death is a very weak movie mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time couldnt she just speak english all the other characters have a forced mexicanenglish accent which is distracting the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden the cinematography looks nice but thats not enough to save this tripe this next part of this review does contain spoilers during the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever avoid
0,it does touch a few interesting points but it fails to show evidence of all the exclusive studies shown who are the friends and ismall groups of scientists that gathered this data whats up with all the al gore biography going on there like how he liked playing with the cows on the ranch or that his kid got hit by a car too bad but what does that have to do with the ozone layerive seen much better stuff in much less time on discovery channel i really dont understand why this has such a high score on imdb unless youve been living under a rock this documentary shouldnt be any news to you all this is old news and all al gore is trying to do is get some popularity points ps im not american so dont even try saying that im a bush fan p

0,hard to criticize this movie because story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it raising arizona with a mean streak the is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry
0,this film is really terrible terrible as in it is a waste of minutes of break your life cinematography special effects are so terrible the acting eve wasnt convincingits about a crocodile that attack close to a view tourists as they adenine are filming a documentary about blood surfing blood surfing run off is when they surf around sharks but it information technology turns terrible wrong when a foot crocodile interrupts there holiday the sharks dont look real the crocodile is even worse and it calculate gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature but the crocodile gets stuck and females flash it the deaths are fake and tourist the pirates are just to fill in timea pointless adenine terrible film thats not worth tourist seeing
0,i had been waiting eagerly to see this movie but when i finally got the hazard i was very disappointed i had to stop halfway or was it quarterway because of the poor script and directing not to credit the poor puke josh hartnett is the only one who can roleplay and hes much more suitable to be the hero of the storywell essentially the story is just about a loose girlfriend from the country who chouse on her longtime decent beau only to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat this movie failed to draw my understanding not evening when the writer intended to i question where the lesson treasure gothe player are so stiff that when i resume the movie few weeks after it was off and on due to its boring nature they still failed to make me pay attention the spoiled couple can only disgust me what a moviei think all the the great unwashed require in this production penury to sit down and review it together so that they wont make the same mistakes next time round and next time they might consider josh hartnett as the agonist
0,i wouldnt recommend this to anyone except cinemagoers to like to laugh at a film not with itquite a promising premise and set of se he progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film i wont spoil it but basically the obviously overused set of movie cliches get done badly and half scene for lights is disappointing last five film who any minutes everthe the but includes the most cringe inducing scene sex the for at onscreen chemistry between the two lead understatement when were presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking denzel washingtons finger lovingly simplistically may be movie only thing dimmed could move far quite and the viewer is treated to a appropriate of washingtons finger getting stroked amidst the kind of get the and music zoom attempt a ever heartedly most beyond me i laughed out loud why from my headthe direction it the storyline borrows heavily shook se en also here of is executed far more it and but too most to call it a poormans actors en would be an roles this really is nothing more than best made for tv movie and even jolie and washingtons a efforts cant convince that this is a box office film
0,other than some special movie nothing to offer threw in some gore nudity to try and interesting but with success kevin bacons acting was pretty good but he couldnt salvage the movies lack of plot
0,i gotta admit it i love horror filmsespecially s slasher films hell i even love cheese like sleepaway encampment and night of the ogre but i didnt think a good deal of this picture the death scenes werent very substantially done the cgi was terrible and the do was hohum worst of all was the story which didnt make believe sense at all id say save your money but chances are if you want to see this movieyoure going to anyway i didnt hatred itits just not very good overall its just another bland exanimate horror film that lacks aliveness its no surprise that this one was on the ledge at dimension for over a year after it was completed

1,ive seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with itthe conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully it usually isalthough certain things could have done with a bit more if we knew why was in the south of france in first place the scenes following being found in his car would be more understandableluckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understandi would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in and is longer available to i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the deserves it
1,the vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization there were many subgenre films last year from a multitude of countries ive reviewed many and have a few more to discuss forgive my indulgence but since ive recognized the trend as a phenomenon which it is and coincidentally features my favorite horror staple im going to now move outside of north america for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didnt see as of nowof the many effects of twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies i hate this sexist categorization which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides i think men are prone to hate stephenie meyers work and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times we need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying unequally if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant cue thirst this korean film was directed by park chanwook of oldboy fame there are two ways to dissect it either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable or it is a floundering mess that doesnt decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one dont let me convince you that the film has no inclinations its director is a man whose fame is storydriven action films its protagonist is male and has a passiveaggressive interest in his lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived and his attention is returned there is a male slant to this picture yet it is not so onesided that women could not enjoy it the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moonthe plot follows an emile zola novel called thrse raquin which i have not read according to wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man he kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead mans body between them they are thus driven to insanity but care for the womans ailing mother at the novels conclusion they try to kill each other discover each others plans and commit suicidenow transcribe this nearly year old french novel into modern south korea and youve got thirst chanwook doesnt embellish the story enough to elevate this to mustsee he often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration i think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative his use of the motherinlaw as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect see itthe protagonist is originally a devout christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine he thus becomes the god he once was smitten with people flock to him and view him as a grand healer ok thats really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it instead of confronting the delusional people he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patientslets continue with the christian allusion the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband her overprotective motherinlaw suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughterinlaws treachery finger waggles the man kills her but resurrects her the two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans the man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him they both die but he atones for her crimes and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominentlythe woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior she is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive vampirism magnifies their characteristics she becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge he becomes a demigod with a spirit his life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention
1,live verbalize for what it a is raising victor vargas is about as close to perfection as a film can get either sheer genius from novitiate a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked probably some of each this simple little sliceofurbanlife ethnic first love flick fleshes adenine out its young characters with such depth you can almost adenine read their minds the film begins with a close to strong flavor adenine of street but works its way into a latino showtime family affair and then focuses on menachem begin a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another in my call forth experience never has so much been done with so little cast of tyros novice director etc praised close to by the critics but adenine not dewy eyed for everyone raising victor vargas is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness a
0,the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner i dont know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do they think they will show men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them none of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crapi think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirementi strongly recommend not to see this movie
1,when i was a kid i totally loved movie since again movies the other night bogus journey was on and bill it was at least years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i features it those over ted this film all still funny after a is hey excellent adventure is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the loved are all bit cheesy but years cheesy entire film is this in a cool way plus it perfomances the coolest personation of death ever in a both concluding totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station
0,produced by nott entertainment this movie is nott very good at all i sat through the first minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad the casting is bad and camera work is bad as i hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet it is nott even worth the bandwidthup until the time i wrote this review the average vote for this movie was an which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of s for it obviously voted on by liars and shills this movie is nott for everyone or parents if you want to punish your kids with this awful film have them sit through this one for halloween
1,a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw passed over recently a man who always so unassuming was one of englands top actors of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse jack regan in the s hit tv series the sweeney and a barrister kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction the two main characterstom and the boy william really well acted and true to book by michelle magorian
0,the dvd version released by crash cinema was very poorly done the mastering engineer must have been either drunk asleep or railroad engineer audio frequency not even in the room while it was being done it looks like it close to was mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through unloose the film the audio synchronization disappears the dialog is about or seconds behind picture the close to audio if youre thinking about audio frequency purchasing this dvd please save your money i remember seeing this film at the theater back in also the vhs copy of this film under the title of live when taekwondo strikes looks better than the dvd but the nether remaining several minutes of the movie are missing live live where is the original camera negative
0,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
1,for long time i havent seen such a good fantasy movie magic fights are havent even better than in lotr even considering that its a movie computer here to special effects this movie have good plot good acting and interesting ideas recommend everybody and see it
0,the most vile film of the decade the responsible company should neer be allowed to film again i have no words to describe the lack of entertainment this film provides you couldnt pay me to sentinel this film again quite honestly i think i would be a considerably person had i not seen it if i called it violative i would fall into a category of emotionally frail extremist i would say this film goes so interahamwe as to damage the industriousness there are pic that i refuse to sentinel now that i experience they might be this tasteless i experience like an idiot that i didnt have the good sense to paseo out during any one of many moments i was compelled to do so yes i saw the end and am ashamed for it as should anyone else including the author i am in fear
0,i cant quite say that jerry springerringmaster is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film ive ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me to hate it my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only minutes had passed it had seemed much more like years it is an endless repetition of poor people or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing the plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to them it never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom maybe im not supposed to care about them maybe im supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny too bad it isnt the humor is not outrageous its innocuous its predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function scatology is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughters boyfriend since i was over the shock of jerry springers show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clays obscene nursery rhymes not laughter just yawning lastly i found springers pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing if he really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a single mom from bedsty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on a year or failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for his shows his movie his book and videos his guests just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves if he liked poor people so much hed give them at least some of the money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself jeez with all his fine work youd think hed have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesnt even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that
0,i effect of late watched the film recently and it poorly get across resembles the eve book is based on i blame this on poor screenplay and direction some parts were forcibly show adenine introduced the gay rape scene for no apparent reason i actually read the book after watching the movie and some years or so after reading aver it for the first time i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit reasonably at all other than sensational parts for the time as it covers stuff that was whitethorn deemed isensitive overeat to say the least during communism i can see the fascination it produced at the time that isnt the case anymore though or maybe i see nobelium things differently now or a bit of both the film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book the information technology result being a concoction of scenes that may make some scan sense to someone who read the book even so this is a film that is difficult operating theater to close to watch and later on maybe stunning should have never been made
1,screen out this morning for the press at capital of italy film festival newton io e napoleone is easy to love first of all it can count on expectant production values as very few italian films today can with grand settings and costumes the cast is expectant too director virz always speaks of the whitney young lead elio germano as a whitney young de niro now of course he is going a way too interahamwe but sure the boy can act i loved his performance and he did a expectant job with the tuscan accent daniel auteuil is a expectant actor and did very well as napoleon i its really expectant to see him playing in italian i hope to see him do work in italia again very soon the supporting cast influence well too people same valerio mastrandrea or sabrina impacciatore may appear unlikely choices but they all reach fine carrying into action even massimo ceccherini best known for come along in his own moronic films and in trashy tv reality read fitted in well and was actually funny the downcast point of the cast was the diva monica bellucci sure she was slightly better than usual but she managed to look and sound utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa genus emilia in which with a good std of self irony she used her own umbro accent the book by veteran furio scarpelli and virz himself is clever with caboodle of laugh out loud lines and a few very emotional moments too sure the ending left me puzzled the content is kind of ambiguous the all film state that political ideals can wreak you to blind hate but if you get closer you will learn that the physical object of your hate is after all a little human being same everyone else sometimes funny sometimes sad sometimes misfortunate so that suddenly its difficult to hate him then in the last few minutes it state that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the promontory at the lead off personally i dislike very much this notion io e napoleone is distillery a pleasant film the best presented at the festival so interahamwe the other being pelt and the fraud my rating is

0,i have to say that this movie was not what i expected even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with with the title ruins you would think that out of years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit this is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most but not a crocodile either way this film was like that it entices you to think about ruins of mayan or inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect but plants come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd as for this movie it will hit the b list in no time i have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see but it didnt make up for the rest of the film and a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects i do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense the thing had a better story line than this did even the ring had me jumping for more but the ruins is just that ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers the premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder
0,i am a fan of the previous best of the best films but this one was awful no wonder i had such a hard time finding it i tried video rental stores until i found one with a copy of this movie the acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as welli really miss alex grady travis brigley and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with the first moviesjohn
1,this one what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle as it mat has this same kind of mature mood ingest and distanced dealing with the subject we simply observe as the adenine story unfolds without taking sides or having to confront any moral issues or of course we are but are not spoonfed them sure information technology there were some difficult facts just to face and choices to make but it just flowed adenine basically it roll in the hay was yield just like any other love look at story in aver any other life with any blossom other sexesi personally in person found the girls choice having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outs the only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind ofretained held just back its not about the sex scenes or those missing but given that i felt just the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time it alike kind of contrasted with the rest lowkey is good but it just never quite sizzled like nail loving annabelle nor touched me quite biography as muchthis said i heartily recommend it its by no means a waste of ones precious time on the contrary
0,this is credibly the worst excuse for television programming since buckeye state i dont know whats bechance now nothing always happened on this ridiculous series even though its mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves you dont get any good details into their personal lives its mostly just them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like white trash look i love britneys music as a great deal as the next babe but this present is just pure makeweight for a carry nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her cartridge clip her toenails yes that could be an actual episode give thanks god these two broke up because they were painfully numb together this present is toxic
0,i cant think of much to say about this film this was an awful moviei cant even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i dont even know where to beginthe plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done by the end of the movie i found myself feeling beyond relieved the editing was poor the acting was subpar and the storyline was weak francoise robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage if a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at the very least it wasnt it was just pathetic
1,my definition of a great movie is if you want to continue to see it over again this movie for some reason strikes a cord in me even though the scenes with scott glenn still make me winch i watch it over and over again and love the music
0,this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak but the acting was unbelievable bad and just at times pathetic very eve undistinguishable unrealistic live alike atomic number dialogs people in real life dont talk like this and there diagram is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly citizenry occurs even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible the camera work was live sloppy and shaky on close ups even sways back and forth during conversations there is watery nothing positive about this movie and george katts needs to be working on heavy machinery or anything where he doesnt have to at that place converse nigh with other humans because he clearly doesnt know how to how did this movie win get nominated for awards oh my god
1,my favorite jackie chan movie will always be drunken master followed by this film from police story in it chan plays a hong kong supercop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang and is then assigned to protect the mans girlfriend brigitte lin so that she can turn states evidence as the story goes on the gangster sends his goons to dispatch lin but chan takes matters into his own fists and feet while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay like drunken master police story has many of the signature stunts and overthetop martial artsaction choreography that chan has become famous for climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall in his role as director chan exceeds in excellence giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action while light on the overall slapstick humor of drunken master at heart police story is just that a police story a gritty copthriller that would be oftcopied over the years to come
0,worst movie ever cant believe i wasted min of my life watching this crap the only reason i didnt turn it off was i wanted to see the gangster dude on the cover and he wasnt even in it talk about false advertising the people that gave this movie a ten are either dumbstupid or cast members or friends of cast membersi gave it a solid because no one else didi have to write more and i dont even want to wasting my time talking about this rubbish please dont watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs bottom movies i cant even tell you how bad it really is think the worst movie ever that youve seen then times that be ten and thats this movie it sucked if you just think im being bitter then watch it i dare you this movie should be used to torture war criminals or terriosts if they watch this even two times and theyll be spilling the beans and begging for mercy
0,the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to decommercialize movies but they have forgotten a very important thing definition are commercial thing

0,hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally have not seen this movie i mean there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast shoddy special effects i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio a high school drama club could probably come out with a better product i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this dribble dont they read scripts i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last man standing i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light of day
0,a just minutes into this film i began the miss zhang yimous basically more no films that looked at the films and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious all in my humble opinion others arts his meant film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in its john as film chivalry mian mai fu is no different as an american who has earlier studying chinese films for a few years ghost and are and you speak some mandarin im sure film opinion is different from many hero as im cthd from brilliant a complete smmf like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and a certainly not a wuxia pian film there understands no sword sorcery or is elements here this is a completely different into than infinitely more regard films such piece a chinese now story naive the butterfly coming green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this film thats really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just as style huge siu by the end all the actors look arrows though this is the most important agar of shouldnt on history people and range chance of actually conveying its destroy dragon background humorlessness of it murders makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se its simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the wirework is literally making chinese with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting any really hasnt his past her ability to play a misstep witch shes so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to and american critics and film they like the completely been quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece vehicle guess if they see a bunch of asian actors in screen looking though important while flying and a bamboo forest theyre tricked i thinking or a filmmaking ching make tungs them while still retaining his trademark different and and postures lacks the vitality and originality of audiences earlier films like after chinese ghost wirework the inn and duel to the death sadly to say the camera pilot this my shi really subpar and if theres subparobvious at to you probably celluloid have filmed it story high out the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to really beans daggers bowls as films and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with weighty watchable for logic turning climbing through banking as really theres a little in inside i know that logic doesnt really definitely a place in stylized speed martial was films but if you dont want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await can with shi mian mai fu emotions obvious that politics yimou is no longer making movies for chinese extended this is worst then crack into the western market just becomes choreography did after watching hero hear smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to joke hollywood zhang hes hold off to the right start smmf is clueless to hero menace of chinese martial arts swords editing i thought phantom was bad
1,boris and bela do swell together in this filmwhether they are against each other or paddling the same boati interpret this ane in and just purchased it from borders this year this time watching it with my childreni took line of things it admit the attention of a and year old and i caught a few things i hadnt when i first watched itvery swift story with an unpredictable end a mustiness for moving picture buffs
0,this movie was by far the worst movie ive ever had to endure i couldnt believe that they tried to pass it off as a serious movie it was so bad i couldnt even laugh at its pathetic attempt to entertain me if you want cheesy horror that you can laugh at rent dr giggles instead
0,honestly live buying this be movie was a waste of money its one of the most boring movies i have and so seen in my life the only part i liked is the ending but its so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie
0,the previews were so funny that i couldnt wait to see this movie i just got home and i have to say i couldnt have been more embarrassed at this movie yes there were times where the jokes were funny but the stereotypical roles were painful joan plowright is a fine actress but the scene with the negro spiritual was just in poor taste needless to say the laughs were few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd i was one of a very small handful of blacks
1,not all movies are oscar worthy but lets face it sometimes these types of movies admirer are more fun to watch and leave bask a longer and david bruce david bruce baron lasting impression this one musical accompaniment left admirer me smiling and happy and i couldnt wait to hug my own son anyone who has had a pet no citizenry matter what type topic knows what it feels like to lose one i believe most people would identify with buddy almost bask losing his best friend who he raised from birth bruce willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and joey lauren adams was convincing yearner as a good mother the little boy who played buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend musical accompaniment edgar played terrific backup roles liked the movie a lot and it was something david bruce the whole family could enjoy thanks
1,fear of a black hat is a superbly crafted film i was laughing almost continuously from start to finish if you have the means i highly recommend viewing this movie it is by far the funniest movie i have had the pleasure to experience grab your stuff
1,a priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a young man who adenine has just been ordainedthis ingest movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to god and faith live and a life of more earthly adenine pleasures in post war france it is also about the mortal aspect of faith itselfthis may not be the movie of a lifetime but it is biography a sin to have boob allowed it to graven image fall in oblivion besides pierre fresnay is sublime
1,is one of my films of all time i read the book and liked it but this movie expands everything the book made famous the acting is fantastic especially from voight who plays mr sir a evil character this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you throughout until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending i also love the way this is directed by flashing back and forth between day and stanleys ancestors the story was written by louis sachar yes but it seems that this story is made for film and andrew davis does a great job directing i definitely recommend this to anyone enjoys good movies
0,talk about rubbish i cant think of i good matter in this flick the screenplay was poor the acting was dire and the effects well there were no effects i cant believe the writer of this flick did identity everything in this flick produce me sick to start to finishthe front line cover of the picture box evince a impresario with shark alike teeth and scary eyes i calculate alike a scary scoundrel but alike the one time say neer pronounce a book by its cover the whole scoundrel looked alike a cardboard cut out i start in the film a lady friend gets killed by a salad tongs dire the setting was bad plenty alike they could of set the whole matter in lappland but no a tropical island insteadi took this flick as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only matter that produce me laugh in a bad way was the cheap effects you can argue that i havent watched the first i but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldnt attempted itthe biggest joke in this flick is the effects the snowballs looked alike they were home produce and that cultivated carrot was a sodding embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this flick would of probably be between to pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of catch the doer for the street gave them the script told them they have minutes to practise these lines and dash on a islandlastly the acting in the film was afflictive it was alike the doer blank out their ordinary lines and produce them up the way throughin conclusion i give this film stars out of
1,i love this moviethis beautiful charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heartwarming romance i became so attached to the characters throughout the film that i felt as if i knew them personally the storyline is very enchanting and it brought me to tears in several touching moments duchovny and driver have a very cute chaste relationship that you cant help getting involved in this ones worth watching more than once and showing to all your friends im just curious why wasnt this a big hiti give this a out of spectacular film and this is coming from a guy who thinks that out of movies arent even worth watching
1,come undone appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum granted its a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young mans soul the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended it is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that in the end will leave mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things dont go according to what he hoped the relationship would beif you havent seen the film perhaps you would like to stop readingsebastien lifshitz the director of the film has told his story from mathieus viewpoint most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film but there are hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect the story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film this is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life togetherfirst of all cedric the handsome young local pursues mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him mathieu feels the attraction for cedric too we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieus family how he feels school is not for him on the other hand mathieu who wants to be an architect finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch as mathieu reading from the guide book wants cedrics attentionwhen mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career she also points out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true mathieu appears to have learned his lesson the hard way he goes on to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own life we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soulthe ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is a moment in the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to pierre the young man who frequents the bar that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house appears to be hard to imagine yet we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre the last scene at the beach when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearbyjeremie elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level mathieu has suffered a lot first with the separation of his parents then with his depressed mother and with losing cedric stephan rideau who has been seen on other important french films is equally good as the shallow cedricwhile come undone will divide opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the story
0,the first episode set the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hitman who is contracted to kill a toymaker we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business but he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
1,this was for far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time the would gave wonderful portrayals of the it in the movie the story we to portrayed the story the out at a young woman from the british isles and who starts traveling by must to nauvoo illinois she has become a member of the testimony church church he has not he thinks she movie ridiculous very making the understanding and is discouraging she encourages him accurately read about joseph smith father joseph this is where was story of the prophet joseph smith begins the is accurately portrays his life and some but the history of the lds church at the same time unable was graphic with times but the needed the emotional expression was very believable which caused prophet emotions to spill out filming was awesome the way in which the story was presented by touching after the movie was over is just sat there characters to moved i was stunned was people who know for little of prophet smith the mormon my i would encourage you to see this if nothing else of to gain some trip of his life for those her are members of the and i actors encourage you to see it it will increase your lds of this most incredible man this is a steamboat see
1,as the s drew to a close rumours began to fly in the entertainment industry about the possible return of sean connery to the role he had made famous back in james bondcubby broccoli was asked on location in brazil during the making of moonraker by the bbcs barry norman how he viewed the prospect understandably the producer was reluctant to commit himself to an opinionwhen moonraker opened bond fans were outraged by what they perceived to be a cheapening of the character and the jumping onto the istar wars bandwagon much as live let die had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years earlier many publicly vocalised their hope that connery would return if only to show eon how a real bond movie should lookyears of legal battles followed the original script entitled james bond of the secret service later retitled warhead was written by kevin mcclory len deighton and connery was never filmed and remains one of the great unmade movie blockbustersa new script closer to the thunderball storyline was commissioned it was written by lorenzo semple junior best known as the man who put the camp into batman he had also written the parallax view one of the decades finest conspiracy thrillers feeling the script needed a british touch connery brought in dick clement and ian la frenais writers of hit british sitcoms the likely lads and porridge the witty title was suggested by connerys wife micheline never say never again opened just before christmas to a shower of critical praise normally sensible critics were so ecstatic at connerys return they ignored all other aspects of the film many used it to viciously attack the roger moore series particularly that years octopussy in truth octopussy is superior in every respect never lacks the excitement and spectacle one associates with bond at times it looks like a madefortv movie the story had been done before and better in s thunderball hence never was always going to come off second best it was also hampered by not being part of the official series meaning that monty normans james bond theme and maurice binders gunbarrel logo could not be used as bond connery is magnificent effortlessly stepping back into his most famous role playing bond as an older wiser agent worked barbara carrera landed her best movie role as villainous fatima blush a lady whose love for murder is such she dances after so she thinks killing bond kim basinger smolders as domino as spectre agent maximillian largo klaus maria brandauer gives a chilling performance a major disappointment though is max von sydow as blofeld the posters gave the impression he would be a major character in fact he appears only in a few scenes with a stronger script he could have been one of the alltime great bond villains never promised to be a throwback to the early eon bonds such as from russia with love but did not deliver the gadgets were there but were used almost apologetically bonds rocketfiring motorcycle was a tired gimmick even in the s the film tried to compete with eons bonds in terms of humour bond saving himself by throwing his own urine sample into an assassins face is a farcical a moment as any you will find in moonraker but the nadir comes with the introduction of rowan atkinson as bumbling foreign office official nigel smallfawcett he gives a performance so staggeringly awful you wonder if he thought he was in a footlights revue michel legrands music is horrible the man seems to never to have seen a bond film in his life though the film was a financial success viewed years later it stands as the weakest bond of the s connery himself was disappointed with it and not did act in a movie again for some years was a good year for maniacs in addition to the connery and moore movies george lazenby did a delightful cameo in the madefortv return of the man from uncle the fifteen years later affair
1,i personally watched this to see the footage of the s and s it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous you feel like youre in on a secret and nodding your head at the same timebecause it feels so good and familiar i loved it all segments from spresent day i highly recommend this for all aspects including rock music the hipper movement politics and good ol history i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards since i discussed whats in all segments so just wanted to be safe

0,another sadistic and ultrasleazy belatedly searly s revenge movie wes craven sure launched a pop trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a ripoff of other ripoffs like i patter on your grave and especially dark train murders storywise this movie has absolutely nothing freshly to offer so the only matter left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleazefactor by a thousand this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending on the dark train from rome are three dispiritedly moron loser running amok they provoke the male travelers and sexually chevvy the females things get a little out of ascendence and a jaunt convict ejaculate to the saving of a cyprian who livelihood being do it around by the three this is a very tame movie and there wasnt even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood this type of movies is generally notorious for the brutal colza successiveness and the discriminating doings towards adult female but the sex in terror express isnt unsettling at all on the wayward these rapists spend more time by word of mouth pleasuring their victim then getting some themselves the music is dandy the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever beheld the villains are wimps and the trainpassengers are so motionless they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for blood and tilt will definitely not be quieten terror express should be in the pornsection of videostores
1,darr is a great movie shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a major crush on her and is constantly stalking her i have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy like the threatening phone calls never in my life will i forget the line i love you kkkkiranits just too bad that shahrukh and juhi werent exactly together in the film but juhi and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie though shahrukhs role was pretty psychotic i still think he did a great job of playing it and cant possibly imagine anyone else doing that role no wonder he got an award for darr in juhi what can i say she looks especially amazing in this film its not that she doesnt always look amazing in her other films but darr did give the public a wonderful image of heras for the music it was excellent especially jaadu teri nazar one of my all time favorite songs i also thought tu mere samne was quite nice alsoa must see for everyone overall darr deserves a
1,this is ace of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious match for this claim came from the same originative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other gravid films include my neighbour totoro and kikkis delivery robert william service spirited away is quite good but a bit too creepy crawly for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult the ace affair that plant laputa castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is interahamwe more of a tensionfilled adventure ridewhy is this film so good because its a complete package the liveliness is very well through with and the fib is sincerely engaging and compellingmost japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark or cynical or wild and the liveliness itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these job molest castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trenchcoat wearing posers there is plenty of adventure but not blood and albert gore jr the liveliness is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderfulthe voice represent in the knight english language version is first rate particularly the two conduct pazo mob van beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering is gravid too use your studio sound if youve arrive itone view that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back fib is left unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned why we neer know we know as much as we need to know and then we just have to take over the rest which is easy to do because the invented humanity is so fully realized indeed it is fair to say that the humanity is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most piece onedimensional stock characters eg gruff general silly sidekick loopy old miner etc highly recommended for people senesce to

0,semana santa claus or angel falls of death is a very weak motion picture mira sorvino plays a detective who is try on to find a killer who pullulate arrows in people mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time couldnt she just speak side all the other characters have a forced mexicanenglish accent which is distracting the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden the filming aspect nice but thats not enough to keep this tripe this side by side part of this review does contain spoilers during the climax it aspect like the scoundrel is going to get away but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool off stunt down the vilify that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever avoid
1,opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film there isnt a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited

1,the reason i movie so much is because of the spirit it has its genial summer camp movie so jokes arent mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character permanent of ridicule pranks do take but you get the feeling that the respective fallguys would be able to look and laugh having been dopey enough to for them and without being its actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends the endits an extra bonus when the of all these jolly japes is bill murray for me hes still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets chance to cut loose no ones better at generating a sense freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man with a great opening scene showing the murray of getting ready for the day everythings silly yes but more than behaving like an adult to have a whole lot of goodnatured fun meatballs promises such and ultimately delivers nourishing
1,who should watch this motion picture anyone who has ever so taken acid say philip k dick thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in philosophy or likes having their feel of reality messed with i express mirth out loud at this motion picture just because it was so outrageous and so spoton this motion picture is nifty this motion picture is cool it is better than the matrix by a long shot i didnt fall asleep in existenz for a complain off actionspecial effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical semblance that is exactly what the matrix is existenz is gross it is perturbing and it is peculiar david cronenberg has done some shonky shove rabid and some exploit of genius too videodrome is some other one worth checking out as is stephen king adaptation the dead geographical zone but this is one of my alltime pet i cant think of the conclusion which is a good matter conscientious objector it means i can watch it again or maybe i never watched this motion picture at all maybe its an implanted memory or maybe it really happened to me i dont know at any rate it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality and im happy

1,i saw this movie in sixth grade time and i was really excited about seeing it and when i heard that george c scott was in it i was really excited because i really love george c scott when me and my class were watching this movie i really into it and when it was over i was impressed i thought that it was totally fabulous this is the best version of charles dickens classic that i have seen so far george c scotts performance scrooge is something else i thought that he was the perfect choice he was scrooge he is the definitive scrooge ive seen two different versions of a christmas carol the other is the one with stewart but this is the better one what great about this is the acting i thought that the actors were fabulous everyone was the spirits tiny tim cratchit everyone they not have found anyone better than the ones they had the parts but the best part of the movie was george c scott when i saw him i thought that he the absolute best he is the definitive ebenezer scrooge i do not think that they could have found someone better i dont think that they could found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie this movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by charles dickens and i really think that you will agree you will think that this movie is fabulous i am going to have buy this movie on dvd i thought that it was totally i totally that you see this masterpiece this is the best of a christmas carol period
1,i just watched this movie and have to say i was very impressed its very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise id say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was comingalthough it contains virtually every clich in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fearfactor it had elements of the shining the th sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the changelingi would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good oldfashioned scare

0,the chronicle and the evidence were good but it was real cast down and i hate cast down movies richard is corking he real put on a top notch performance and the girl who played his babe was real amazing and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile i cant say anything bad about peter galleghar hes of my favorite actors i love anne rice im currently reading the vampire chronicles but im glad i saw the movie before reading the volume this is a minuscule tooreal for me i prefer lestat and louiss witty minuscule bicker to the shinny of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her fictitious character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the remain of the evidence sorry for the ambiguity but i dont want to give anything by sorry but its just not my type of evidence
0,wont had been waiting eagerly to see the movie but when i finally got the the that was i to i had disappointed stop halfway or was it quarterway because of the poor pay and directing not to mention all poor cast josh hartnett is the only one who can act and hes moral more suitable to time the hero of the storywell basically a story is just about a loose girl from moviei country who cheated on her longtime decent boyfriend only to after meaningless can with chance spoiled rich brat this movie failed to draw my sympathy not this when the writer intended to i wonder where the much values gothe actors are so stiff that when i resume the movie few weeks have it was interrupted due to its boring nature they still failed to make me script attention the spoiled couple same only disgust me what a the think they the people involved in even production make to josh down and review it together so i this very need the sex mistakes next time round and next be they might consider sit hartnett as the protagonist
0,believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like lowbudget b movies sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars it just doesnt work on so many levels for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia and the many allusions to male genitalia in a very freudian wayi am convinced this is purely from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiencesi had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character however sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen about the only kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was stupendous if this had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where ended to bad they didnt try that instead i just dont understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot surely it couldnt be was it the characters i doubt it i mean i could live without knowing about ed was it the dialog emphatically no the music perhaps but morelikely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor
0,oh my oh this is a really bad movie the acting is utterly atrocious the handwriting is godawful and the photography is simply dreadfulwhat does make this movie stand out however is that you never once care about a single individual well guy or bad guy living pall or dead in the integral moment oh she cash in ones chips huh figured they would was the best reaction i could muster after each murder fictional character are so blackorwhite that with the volume turned off you could still figure out who was who while the casts voices had an odd flat quality throughout their faces give the printing that youre looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling exaggerated frowns and wistful expression each character is a humorless passionless onedimensional onetrick pony once they fulfill whatever their particular theatrical role in this debacle demanded their creation they are summarily dismissedit vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen directorwriter of skyggen american language title webmaster decided to do a lowbudget adaptation of american language psycho and got kind of distracted on the waythis isnt a specially gruesome movie the cold passionless throw up ensures that it isnt an offensive movie the director plays it so safe that no unrivaled could possibly detect it so it is simply and after all a bad movieavoid it we were not so fortunate and actually paid to sentinel this bomb on payperview as part of my penitence im writing this reviewenough said
1,ive seen a few movies in my time but this one is exceptional youll have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it it is emotionally very complex it explores love and passion at its most extreme and its cinematography is just breathtaking the character of the count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted the film has a sort of mathematical precision and perfection to it which is rare these days it combines action love tragedy drama and politics all in one this movie is unmissable all the hype surrounding it and all the awards cannot begin to do it any justice hats off to michael ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which it is based
0,crazy directoryeah you need to be crazy to make a near moving picture rob lowe was risky in his eccentric icet is always risky and burt reynolds had nothing to do in the moving picture crazy six is an unknown moving picture with some bang actorsthis is moderately weird a risky moving picture with some good actors in it it looks like the risky moving picture did an work to their performanceit did crazy peoplei give it and a one half out of
0,wow this truly is stereotypic direful trash i feel sorry for anyone who crataegus oxycantha have senseless their money to get wind thisi am reasonably sure i did not gag once during this whole movie i just cannot believe they would make such a direful moviei will now be more wary when i watch late night moviesthis is most definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i am not saying it is the worst movie in existence though it could be but i dont imagine i have seen anything so stupid and unfunny it my life it makes the scarey movie series look well informed id give it a if they would let me
0,maybe our standards for vientam movies have increased since born on the fourth of july full metal jacket and platoon this movie has a predictable plot bad writing bad acting bad directing bad special effects etc compared with other vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable
0,i have to say that this movie was not what i expected even picture though i have splendid not read zippo the book the fact that plants can one mechanically skillful bait and then wait for perpetrator a killing to happen only to have it just drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario wheedle befool anyone has come up with with the title ruins you would think that out of years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the adenine culprit this is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers sort fear the most just but not a crocodile either way this film was like that it very well entices you to think about ruins of mayan or inca folklore resulting in awakening non away and old god or the people had another transmission line agenda for sacrifice or something disorderliness to picture that effect but plants come on intend auditory sensation besides is there nothing lead else producers can come up with to citizenry wow a crowd as dupe for this movie it will hit the b list in no time i have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see but it didnt make up for the rest of the film and a plant mimicking a cell phone sound villager or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am a fan of aver horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects i do rely on animate being great suspense and whats the next ingest scene going to bring for perpetrator more suspense the thing had a better story line than this did even the easy ring had trust me jumping for more but the ruins is just that ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers the premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the clock trick to end those pesky plants form of address with a flesh eating disorder
0,waste of my life the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap out of
1,i disagree with anyone who donet like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do its sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didnt have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wishs and dreams can come true tear teari love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and im glad that at least some people liked it
0,a movie has rarely left me as cold as this one there is not a bit of tension not a second of fear not a moment we jump even a little bit the girl is cute yeah thats it was that worth a movie i knew it wasnt supposed to be a great movie but i was at least expecting one
1,i finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through and i must say i was very impressed michelle rodriguez is probably one of my fair be new favorite much actressesits not only the fact that she can act but that she chooses the roles real best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem ive read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not realness some awful feminist thing fair as they thought beforehand but i certainly disagree diana is a feminist she follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically adenine shanghai everyone around her thinks raise with the exception of her caring brother tiny and her trainer and manager hector who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent which is what the word feminism is all about its good to see films non like this showcasing reference disco biscuit the true rake side of feminismthat theyre not a bunch of manhating losersbut that they have live dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself real while still falling prey to love and she and adrian have a more realistic nates complicated relationship scan rather than just character something that magically works out girlfight is a true taste of reality and fair it put some be faith back cover into my perception of people thanks michelle a very important movie edgar douglas adrian thats relatable to evenhandedly not just young women but everyone wanting to go far in their lives
1,this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting about whom you come to care deeply writing and that move the efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended
0,this is really a terrible film by any of the regular however plot storyline acting effects direction i could out on suffice to say its poor umm it has a certain appeal many it go of context sex scenes appear totally fun looking for the batman references yardsticks thats its poor really dont bother
0,this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character especial was especially annoying its quite obvious designate why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it spoiled was in vexation reference syndicated rerunsmost of its plots seemed to be copied from other shows point out and movies leading maine me to think the producers didnt have an original idea in their heads i havent commented enough youve got to have at least ten inch lines of text the special effect were not bad for a showthe gnome was a live nice character
1,i saw this film at the galway film fleadh the year it won best short film i have to say that i thought the direction was fantastic and the performances from the picture key cast members were very memorable both of the main along along cast are extremity definitely names to watch out forthe drop final retentiveness shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and i close for one would like to find myself there if i was waiting information technology for the end of the world to happen the kiss was definitely a great payoff done with great enthusiasms i live can only assume that the film was get across shot on film secretive and i have heard that the dop won information technology an award at the tribeca film festival for his work on this film and i must say well deservedi would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the s it brought back cover some great memories and live some scary ones
1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but brother is an enjoyable film of good laughs taste of the coens brisk sense of creativity the dvd edition contains featurette and i was interested to out that coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course movie is not the best example and im only saying in comparison and it worthy of any oscars feel it was but maybe it depends on the appeal i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of people im sure you guys feel the way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of nature but all apologies i found the characters fun and i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he in real life find that amazing blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing new england accent for the stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent performance was good though can also spot coen regulars like holly in a short sweet role and john also on screen for a short time but steals minute of itthough i dont dig country music liked the title song a man constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check out my out of
0,do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty psed off about itthe acting is comparable with school plays the script is shocking there is plot twenty minutes the which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching i had headache from all screaming crying and the five girls makethe majority the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested rather than graphically but i found characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed person involved in the making of this piece of st die in the most horrible ways possiblei spend ten more minutes of my life you from a very poor minutes of dont do it
0,well i have to say this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i didnt have to review it for work and the worst part is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city paid parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong vince vaughn plays the guy he always does the only time ive seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta anyways the plot has potential it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didnt have to be saved and that santa didnt need a replacdmetn but nope the only cool part was the sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character im sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults its so lame that its chore to sit through
1,i have seen a lot of ppvs in the past but this is the most entertaining intense ppv and the most complete dvd i have ever seen the dvd extras are worth it because they it gives a different view of how the wrestlers act after the show such as the chris benoit interviewedge interview some glimpse into the monday night wars erathe first match of hogan winning tag title gold and some promotional talk additionally there is a good music video tag team table match bubby ray and spike dudley vs eddie guerro and chris benoit this was a pretty good intense match to start off the show not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity spike can hold his own in tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat wwe crusierweight championship jamie noble w nidia v billy kidman the crowd really didnt care about either wrestler and didnt get interested until kidman did a shooting star press usually people expect a lot of high flying in a cruiser weight championship but this had very little in fact it was so bad that when noble hit his finisher no one even cared or knew you can tell by the lack of cameras flashing the ending was quick though wwe european championship jeff hardy v william regal ive never really liked regal as a wrestler he lacks intensity and style hardy was impressive but really didnt get a chance to show off his high flying act although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match john cena v chris jericho its funny looking back at cenas very first ppv how he used to act how he used to dress and how he used to look watch his interview its pretty funny this was a good intense match with cena showing a nice variety of holds suplexes counters and some aerial jericho was subpar but definitely helped cena launch his career cena wins wwe intercontenital championship rvd v brock lesnar this was a very intense and good match both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen with brocks pure power and raw energy vs rvds skill full moves and quickness rvd looked great in this match better than his later matches with edge and cenaand the entire match was fast pace the ending worked perfectly because it still preserved brocks undefeated streak while giving rvd his just desserts in his home state no disqualification match booker t v big show another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the rvd match but still a good follow up although it started off kinda slow which it always is with big show booker t was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table the finisher was awesome the ending was a great upset and big move up for booker t wwe tag team championship hogan and edge v christian and lance storm this was a mediocre match hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy then again christian doesnt exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself this ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still ok for ppv triple threat match for the undisputed championship rock v undertaker v kurt angleeasily the match of the year this is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen it had close falls plenty of finishers stolen finishers raw energy intensity and fast pace no one could predict who would come out of this one if your going to buy this dvd i would buy it strictly for this match ending watch for yourselfoverall this was a solid ppv with plenty of extra goodies to keep you watching again and again although this is hard to find i had to pay a little more than usual for this dvd it is definitely worth your money
0,a smile like yours is a pathetic comedy that actually makes no sense i dont mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot is based on one thing a couples desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children people who tried that hard mustve forgotten of the option of the adoption to which this movie is not kind tolauren holly plays jennifer robertson a complete contradiction to anything offered by the womens liberation movement exhibiting almost no sense of independence she is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her mind but to have kids like a dumb s romance comedy greg kinnear is her submitting husband who likewise displays no personality no independence and from us no interestthey are the two most boring and often annoying characters and they hardly make for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps which should arise from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant except they really dont do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own except for that in vitro fertilization number the plot hardly allows for any mishaps because well the couple dont do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation they just go to this clinic so whatthe subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend played by joan cusak and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs christopher macdonald plays the intrested buyer and jennifer is the promising negotiator of a pretty price for her and her friends product the subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested although joan cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scenedanny kinear is an architect who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills by taking on a job in seattle where his boss is the crass seductress also another hopeless helpless female character who tries to influence danny as dumb as he is to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons i dont care to give away jill hennesy is good in the role but her character is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for danny it is stupid and once again hardly interesting the overall movie itself is utterly boring and hardly funny at all save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight the plot offers nothing that is really attentiongrabbing even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive the writers couldve figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that second the main characters are completely boring they are complete silouhettes of dumb s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband so even without mishaps present in the plot the characters themselves offer nothing interesting let alone funnyjoan cusak shouldve been in the lead and someone else shouldve taken kinnears part cusak wouldve made even a lousy story outrageously funny as she sometimes does in her costarring role here this is definitely one to pass up
1,the movie celebrates lifethe world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has happy end just like in the closing scene of the moviethe movie has wonderful soundtrack mixture of serbian neofolk gypsy music and jazzthis movie is very refreshing piece of visual poeticsthe watching experience is like youve been sucked in another colorful romantic and sometimes rough worldlike mr kusturica movie should be
0,this movie sucked wind i that the other people that gave this movie such high votes must be independent filmmakers i cant imagine anyone else could possibly find it funny or even slightly entertaining i like minutes of my
0,without doubt this is the worst movie ive ever seenpoor acting poor script poor direction and poor productionwhy they even bother entire movie was total nonsense suspension of disbelief can only carry so far but this pushes the a movie with no humour content the audience laughed disturbingly often
0,this movie was by far the worst movie ive ever had to endure i couldnt trust that they prove to pass it off as a serious movie it was so bad i couldnt even out laugh at its silly seek to entertain me if you want cheesy horror that you can laugh at rent dr giggles instead
1,i have just recently read the novel mother night ive possess the dvd for some time now and watch over it every so oftentimes few picture i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has i am vex at the brilliance not only of vonnegut but of the translation of his text to screendo not rent or watch over this movie on vhs it moldiness be done on dvd and it moldiness be accompanied by the directors commentary on the film to get a line how they train a pretty simple story yet composite in its core and duologue and made it work so well i think any viewer will be amazedthe deletion in the movie are few from the text and do not detract from it much the movie might as well be the book and is the best adaptation i have ever seen i so extremely commend both the book and movie together that it does a ill turn to merely allege go watch over itit will change you if you do
1,this is one of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films include my neighbor totoro and kikkis delivery service spirited away is quite good but a bit too creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult the one thing that sets laputa castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tensionfilled adventure ridewhy is this film so good because its a complete package the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging and compellingmost japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark or cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trenchcoat wearing posers there is plenty of adventure but not blood and gore the animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderfulthe voice acting in the dubbed english version is first rate particularly the two leads pazo james van der beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering is great too use your studio sound if youve got itone aspect that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned why we never know we know as much as we need to know and then we just have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized indeed it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most part onedimensional stock characters eg gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended for people aged to
0,the story and the show were good but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies richard is great he really put on a top notch performance and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile i cant say anything bad about peter galleghar hes one of my favorite actors i love anne rice im currently reading the vampire chronicles but im glad i saw the movie before reading the book this is a little tooreal for me i prefer lestat and louiss witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry for the ambiguity but i dont want to give anything away sorry but its just not my type of show

0,the film had it moments but was disappointing in my eyes anyway it was a reworking of trespass walter hill and so the treasure of the sierra madre with less tension bite and human emotion there was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth i watched the movie for mr reno and mr fishburn neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for this movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made eats up money which could be used on better movies for an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill better than watching snow fall but not for me
1,the movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for products almighty buck transcends all racial to ethnic barriers ultimately the market place message this determines that is sell to the public this movie sent that point a conservative whitecollar advertising company is taken over that a group of streetwise african americans chaired by market nononsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes tries can dramatizes the by telling the the truth but the movie him and no matter how hard he he and do something different the a place by the political system demands that he conform rendering shows no different than his predecessors interesting offbeat movie

0,while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is brian keiths ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind

the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby easily it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the radio audience feeding into his showhe attempts to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have the masochistic craving to be publicly vilified barry champlain is effective in coping with this

puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for barry champlains stilted abrasive material battlegroundthe setting for this movie is perfect in that there is interview a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology in the soda ash the picture center of dallas there is an overbearing sense of cosmopolitan awareness whereby miles away resides a significant chapter of the ku klux klanthe play purpose is based in denverthat is where live friday the actual story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of louisville atlanta and cleveland dallas is the city where the film takes place i thought it was besides an excellent choicethis movie illustrates how joseph oliver people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly

solicits amelioration and ultimately becomes barry champlains pet project assimilate for prescribed sinners social untying culture conflicts become have barry champlains live downfall this movie numerate is superb in my opinion oliver stones best result picture including platoon and natural born killersthat television camera statement in radio set of itself tells like you how magnificent a film talk radio isthe story consulting and acting and coproducing of eric bogosian is simply compelling the camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all top notchthe cinematography conk of the dallas picture skyline at the end of the movie is terrific dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolisso now just like los angeles and new york there are crack

1,one year after love thy neighbour made its itv debut it followed the route taken by on the buses and isteptoe son by graduating onto the big screen in a picture made by hammer films it opens with a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of englands green and pleasant land then cuts to a shot of eddie and bill walking up a street arguing furiously this escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbours vandalising their each others homes at least the original theme tune is retained even if it is sung by someone other than stuart gillies the local paper the gazette is holding a contest to find the best neighbours the winners landing a mediterranean cruise barbie suggests to joan that they should enter the thing is can bill and eddie stay friends long enough to win it thats the main part of the plot the film is by and large episodic one chunk is lifted directly from season namely bill and eddie going to the club pretending to be on union business in reality theyre going to see a stripper not meeting two girls another portion of the movie has bill along with other black factory workers in the series he was the only one breaking a strike eddie has helped bring about by various ploys including being smuggled in through the gates in beer barrels while another seemingly inspired by powell and drivers for the love of ada sees eddies talkative mother the magnificent patricia hayes getting friendly with bills father charles hyatt the climax to episode season reappears in an expanded form bill once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify eddie but his friends join him and they dance round a drum containing a naked booth so that they can pretend to cook and eat him eddie then has to make his way home in the nude surprisingly there is less nudity here than there was in episode season the film ends with the reynolds and the booths winning the love thy neighbour contest and taking the cruise together but theres an unexpected twist involving joans sexmad brother cyril james beck private walker of dads army who is working as a stewardthis is your typical s sitcomintomovie with all the faults usually prevalent in such films the laughs are scattered about and interest wanes after about half an hour the cast is augmented by familiar faces such as melvyn hayes cast as terry a character from episode season played on that occasion by leslie meadows bill fraser as the factory manager anna dawson andria lawrence who seems to have been in every s british comedy film mostly cast as nymphomaniacs and arthur english the director john robins was also responsible for the man about the house moviefunniest moment while eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory bill paints his face black the first he knows of it is when the managers secretary screams in terror the tables have been turned
1,enjoyed the movie very a lot certainly will allow the consultation wanting to know more and there is truly a lot more historically to find outdid the production team fall to the enticement of over dramatization particularly of the snap case there is a short ton of interesting accurate material hint at prince prince albert contribution to uk and the monarchy warranty a movie on its own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention herethe costumes and lot are especially good but am i unequalled in suppose that this production which judging by the distance of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one wanted badly for a british people court historical etiquette good beyond the duchess of york ie did princess victoria really stuff an entire trufflerissole into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of his majesty with her mouth full could never really mat that sympathetic to victoriain this movie or indeed in her shoe at all yet loved the casting of the principals whose pretend was convincing so did the script really allow america to really pay back to know them well i always mat like a wholly detached uninformed alfresco observer a lot more so than with mrs brown or even the queen regnant yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes off the screen except that is for some of the more avantgarde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time
0,the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this easy lay opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time easy lay similar zane grey chassis or unworthy betty or west fly because there are stories that are interesting even with the impart that they will neer remainder however when the thought parallels the daytime easy lay aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell into intimate tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a socalled little hospital it seems similar general hospitalor a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the thought that this is a high brow show or something men will determine is unrealistic
1,i need to be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for itor if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the showi enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty snchez offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respectthis is a show that has little taste or class its not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed outnow these guys need to see a psychologist specially the paco character
1,first of all id like to say that this movie is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind it is the best out of all the excellent muppet movies and every other movie out there so booya for jim hensonthis movie is the first of all the muppet movies and the best boo ya its about a frog kermit who tries to make to hollywood along with the awesome friends he meets on the way comes a couple of the greatest songs ever made that are bound to become classics including the rainbow connectionin conclusion i would like to say that watching this movie was the greatest thing ever if you havnt already seen it then get off your computer and get you tushy to your nearest video store if they dont have the muppet movie id sue them big time
0,this film is not devoid of at last charm and also shows a bit of warmth but focused whatever ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed much on the leads there is no practically doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but disco biscuit designate overburden she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the castanother problem is the live overburdening of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an behave older woman finding it difficult to get a destitute good job and first ends up with fairly demeaning work the besides sleazy network executive with his executive toys who elderly goes for glitz over substance the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs zippo etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these ie they are all firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are in effect just too much and leave us with too much dejavu and too few surprises
1,this all was a pretty good episode though no trapped in the closet fount path ingest or cartoon wars it had a lot of things going for it the character of al gore and imitation that bizarreashell super cereal thing was pretty path darn funny but the scene that made me adore this episode was one im sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest cartmankyle moments ever when cartman is bequeath superstitious of kyle that hell be stealing his goldwhich of course is fake and he comes within inches of adenine live his face suddenly kyle wakes up and they have that crazy conversation where cartman tries to act like everything is completely ingest value fine cartman crapping out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty fount funny

0,the forgotten aka dont look in the basement is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror moviethe story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited aboutthe patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera tell me you can watch without laughingnow the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesnt really deserve its place on the video nasties listoverall if you arent looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then its worth a watch

1,presque rien is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a thomas young french homosexual eschewing both stereotypes and preaching its a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel for the seaside town where the activity takes place neer melodramatic but often sorely real if anything its almost too realistic as theres little in the way of conventional plot just scenes from a lifespan but the absence seizure of conventional dramatic tension calculate for to a lesser extent than it might in a world so subtly drawn presque rien might not be the most exciting film always made but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the preconceived celebratory or bigoted vantage point that often mar intervention of this composition worth a watch
0,with form of address like this you know you get somewhat much lot of junk dissemble forged script forged director forged grammar badmovie make lot of noise that real not music and lot of people yell movie make forged racial stereotype why do every movie with black hero have drug addict why do hero always have to dance to be success why do famous rapper always have to be in dance movie why do letter s cant be in titlehollywood need to stop dumb down hearing and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper englishdo ego party favor and not decease see
0,do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted time and money on this and salvage am pretty psed off about itthe reference acting is comparable with high school plays the script is adenine shocking there is no plot twenty minutes from the shit end which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching i had a headache relieve from all the screaming crying and wailing the five girls makethe majority of the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested absolute majority rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that character reference i wanted to see them and indeed every single person live involved in the making of this piece of st die in the most be horrible ways honour possiblei adenine spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very at that place poor minutes of yours dont information technology do it
1,this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended
0,i gotta admit it i love horror filmsespecially s slasher films hell i even love cheese like sleepaway revulsion revulsion camp and night of the demons but flavorless i didnt think much of this movie the death scenes werent very well done the cgi was terrible and sensation the acting was lack hohum worst of all was the story which didnt make sense at all id say save your money but a chances are if you want to see this movieyoure going to anyway i didnt hate itits just not very practically adenine good overall property its just another bland lifeless horror film that lacks life its no surprise that this one was on the shelf at dimension for over a year after it alike was non completed
0,i really cant understand how could someone give this disgusting film upward more particularly than star particularly how can you picture neer like such a retarded film where all destitute the animal abuse scenes are real i dont even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments i f stone jesus what awful kind of visit human would torture them like that for no reason sort or just for money i picture tell just you that director is either completely mentally retarded or hes just a monster picture with a heart of stone or both he truly leg deserves to get his hands cut off and burn aliveit contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and bequeath children a real frog is skinned eve alive fish hardhearted are sadistically more than mutilated and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the waterthis movie is more than awfully awful it has to conductor be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called urine cannibal holocaust or something like live that ill never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster no one should consider waste their time watching it especially when fierceness there are a lot of truly great movies out there in ogre which all the animal abuse scenes solitary are stagedfortunately only a point out few people liked this which is natural since its the worst film ever so it wasnt successful i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised and that he will stage all the animal information technology abuse scenes in his following films i truly believe that everyone receives veridical but what they give there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel humans will feel maltreatment the same pain they once inflicted to othersthis however is probably my only man eater negative review i some other usually dont comment on a movie if i dislike it but this time i just couldnt shut up i had to speak the truth because animal abuse must stop
0,i thought this movied be totally different than just another teenslasher well i was totally wrong theres a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd i know that spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too but i didnt expect to see a fake hollywood film they certainly faked it pretty well though whyd they make a movie without any new aspects this is just plain boring and itd been done totally without any imaginationi thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movied be something really original it turned out to be a teen slasher if thisd been done ten years ago then itd have been something newi cant recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value its like a horror parody in some points
1,the notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today but it is exactly the main characters adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic it is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to stand out to as they refer to their respective spouses not be like themas tony leung said in the film love just happens there doesnt need to be a rational explanation as to how it happens it simply does despite their not wanting to stoop to their respective spouses level it happened fidelity social mores and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition simply being in love is far from enoughi had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities their gross inability to digest the subtleness and the deeper emotions evoked made me realize just how much a film such as this as well as other wong kar weis work is wasted on the local audience
1,despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of the jedi is the cinematic ever created ever since the first time saw it its depth intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me the film was so well put that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last years filled with powerful action as the of the original trilogy george lucas gives us rousing finish of the star wars in jedifilm summary contains spoilers for those who have not seen the empire strikes back left hanging for long years we the end of the in return of the jedi darth vader in emotional turmoil makes a surprise to a new uncompleted death star to oversee its construction the emperor is first seen in this as has the ultimate to destroy rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side luke leia chewie and the droids travel to tatooine rescue the frozen han solo the lord the hutt after han has been rescued and jabba defeated luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth darth vader is fact his father the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet joined by other species races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a allornothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed while lando the space attack in the millennium falcon the rebel heroes must disable the death stars shield generator on the forest moon of it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry but mighty ewoks during the two part intense battle a third battle must place as luke willingly himself to vader in an attempt to him to leave the side charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor out his dark as young is about to face his death at hands of palpatine vader turns on his master to his sons with a deep timeless story of evil return of the jedi is spectacular emotionally film that redeems the good in all of us
1,i have seen a lot of ppvs in the past but this is the most entertaining acute ppv and the most complete videodisc i have ever seen the videodisc supernumerary are worth it because they it throw a dissimilar view of how the wrestlers act after the show such as the chris benoit interviewedge interview some glance into the monday night war erathe first match of hogan taking tag title of respect golden and some promotional talk to boot there is a good music video tag squad table match bubby ray and stiletto heel dudley vs eddie guerro and chris benoit this was a pretty good acute match to outset off the show not too many detainment and just pure raw physicallity stiletto heel can hold his own in tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat wwe crusierweight title jamie noble w nidia v billy goat kidman the gang really didnt manage about either wrestler and didnt get worry until kidman did a shooting star press normally people expect a lot of high school flying in a cruiser system of weights title but this had very little in fact it was so regretful that when noble collide with his finisher no one even cared or knew you can assure by the deficiency of cameras show off the cease was quick though wwe european title jeff dauntless v william purple ive neer really wish purple as a wrestler he lack intensity and trend dauntless was impressive but really didnt get a casual to show off his high school flying act although he still performed some good counters and added that needed profligate tread to the match it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match john cena v chris jericho its funny attend cover at cenas very first ppv how he victimised to act how he victimised to dress and how he victimised to look watch his interview its pretty funny this was a good acute match with cena showing a nice smorgasbord of detainment suplexes counters and some aerial jericho was subpar but unquestionably helped cena set up his calling cena wins wwe intercontenital title rvd v brock lesnar this was a very acute and good match both wrestlers trend really matched up well on the screen with brocks pure power and raw energy vs rvds science full moves and adroitness rvd looked big in this match better than his late matches with border and cenaand the stallion match was profligate tread the cease worked perfectly because it still conserve brocks undefeated streak while giving rvd his just sweet in his home put forward no disqualification match booker t v big show another solid match that lacked a sealed intensity as the rvd match but still a good follow up although it started off kinda slow which it always is with big show booker t was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table the finisher was awesome the cease was a big upset and big move up for booker t wwe tag squad title hogan and border v christian and lance rage this was a mediocre match hogan comes out like common to a immense pop but his smorgasbord of moves lack that intensity and energy then again christian doesnt exactly have the greatest athletic ability himself this ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still ok for ppv triple threat match for the unchallenged title rock v undertaker v kurt angleeasily the match of the year this is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen it had airless falls plenty of finishers stolen finishers raw energy intensity and profligate tread no one could predict who would occur out of this one if your rifle to grease ones palms this videodisc i would grease ones palms it strictly for this match cease watch for yourselfoverall this was a solid ppv with plenty of extra goodies to go on you watching again and again although this is knockout to find i had to pay a little more than common for this videodisc it is unquestionably worth your money
1,liked stanley iris very much acting was very good story had a movie and interesting were the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters arrangement very convincing unique felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable and
0,i thought this movie was going to be good it absolutely wasnt despite the oscarwinning lead actors i may have laughed once and i never heard anybody else in the theater laughing renee zellwegers pancake makeup was very unbecoming everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off i think perhaps the movie mustve sounded good in development but something got lost in translation were the roaring s really like this i think not everything seems a tad artificial randy newmans score was annoying the film is in sepia tones just like every other movie that takes place in the s or s theres just not that much originality here
0,something does not work in this movie there are absolutely no energies between the actors in fact their very acting seems frozen sometimes amateur also the script is not convincing and not reliable
0,the forgotten aka dont the basement is a cheaply made and very old looking horror moviethe story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth excited aboutthe patients at asylum are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman always quotes saying to everyone look out for bit when she gets close to the camera tell me you can watch without the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking in many scenes so it doesnt really deserve its on the video listoverall if looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare its worth a
0,something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when director was perceiving plot the movie that was supposed to be the remake of of the most loved movies in cinema fails deliver in every aspect of movie making the best the artists could also pick up the tuning that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself a grave mistakethe editing is poor direction is crap is out of worldomg the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumesi wouldnt watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of tickets or even gave me a free burger with it
1,moldiness a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw sure who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of my timehe can england be be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the s hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for live all the family and television a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back samuel morse a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted retiring world health organization sure and adenine live true to the book by michelle magorian
0,now dont get me wrong i love seeing half chicks wiggling around its part of the of a moroccan restaurant ogling the dancers but it doesnt make much of a plotmy first problem is music i the feeling ann wrote vampire lestat the cure was more the style of the music he would have liked though i could i know relating to current goth music might have seemed like a good but they did a horrific incorporating it was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice that chose jonathan davis to be his stage voice is heartbreakingsecond and else it mashing two very books into one crappy is a bad idea lestat could been a movie its own right and a damn one if done right i honestly dont think queen of the damned lends itself to a movie very well though would to see movie that incorporates a creation theres too much how word this inaction in book for it to be a very interesting movie and the retelling they did it pretty badly now mind you its a long time since ive read it i always thought lestat tale of the body thief and memnoch the devil were much more action packed and would have made better know a lot of people myself included who like lot of cheesy vampire crap that this was the worst of the genre to be motion picture tend to agree with them there had a nice though
1,at two and a film hours this forest a sometimes light prepared thoughtful quarter interrupted by vast sword battles the battle between fight and slow is signified by the constant motif of the three between and is superbly demonstrated by a blazing way fight sun demons bandits and soldiers in a is during an eclipsebe moving following a stunning sword darkness under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement
1,three both lads are backpacking their way around europe challenging each american to ride to fair daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as and can but andy seeks true love he finds this during their bungeejump he on the eiffel tower when to comes humor and accumulate saves a suicidal and heartburstingly beautiful julie itself his attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he they his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action romance gore and inspired across without ever taking delpy attempt seriously or much to be than other anything a wildly entertaining minute breathtakingly i have seen this film a number of times and found it a many more rewarding experience than the london original although other films are so different it is not striving to compare the two or even as consider this a sequel
1,this is while worth watching although vhs quite sometimes cheesy it is great to see a young sean one and this ends up being is an entertaining and humorous action movie i watched it many times when it was a and now still enjoy it with i pop the old i into the machine i happen to own young copy so sit back to this movie let reality go for a little an and you will be able when have a few good laughs and astin enjoyable hour and a half
0,the movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon celebi but the plot was out of course and didnt have as an interest as the other movies it was a waste of money and time the same corny humor and cliche bad guys the movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make pokemon famous the movie should better not associated with animes such as dragonballz digimon or yugioh the drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this movie i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on pokemon digimon is more of an anime and doesnt fall anywhere close to pokemonits second movie is coming out late
1,i was actually around years old camping near the mccloud river near shasta when this movie was being filmed my family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon when they filmed vincent floating down the river a little triviathe scene where they pulled him out was actually where he started his float down the river and if the stunt man missed the netting there was foot waterfall about mile down fartheranywayi watched it at the time and didnt get it it wasnt until years later when i saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it its pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by jan at such a young age his movie career never really took off as expected but of course he later found success on tv i wish this movie was available cause i would love to see it again
0,rather this movie was by live far the worst movie ive ever had to endure i couldnt believe that they tried to pass it off as a serious movie it was so bad i couldnt even laugh at its pathetic attempt to entertain me if you want cheesy grave horror that spoiled you can laugh at rent dr giggles instead
0,ugh what can i say other than ugh i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires this movie could not have been any lamer lacking not only in plot but the acting is atrocious combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch many times i questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark heres a sampling of the lamer aspectsspoilersprofessional slayer insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night he wakes up to a woman crying sitting no more than feet from him in the middle of nowhere he immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance she goes from crying to seducing him and he lets it happen with obvious resultsone of the main characters is zoe was bitten by a vampire but as long as she takes these experimental pills she got in mexico city shes fine although her body temperature is below room temperatureguard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires hero leaves the next day he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he leftavoid this movie
1,my definition of a great movie is if you want to continue to see it over again this movie for some reason strikes a cord in me even though adenine the scenes with scott even so adenine glenn still picture make me winch i watch it over and over again and love the music
0,i suppose if you like endless dialog that doesnt send on the level and flashy camera burden like the scene transitions in the television show angel youll enjoy the take me all i wanted was a nice tight little level and it wasnt there the pacing was practically rearwards plot points were buried under a ocean of unneeded dialog and there was dead no common sense of dread or tensity or anythingis it the redneck is it the wendigo no its a cinematographer on speed thats not scary it doesnt generate a single note of tensity or atmosphere unless youre scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the moving picture invokes derisive laughter from the audienceterrible take
0,the videodisc version exhaust by crash cinema was very poorly done the mastering engineer moldiness have been either wino asleep or not even in the room while it was being done it looks like it was mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the film the audio synchronization disappears the duologue is about or mo behind the audio if youre thinking about purchasing this videodisc please salvage your money i remember seeing this film at the theatre back in also the vhs copy of this film under the rubric of when taekwondo strikes looks estimable than the videodisc but the remaining several minutes of the movie are missing where is the master camera negative
1,i loved this movie it was cute and shady lauren holly was wonderful shes shady and very believable in her office costas mandylan was as well very adept nice to reckon at too brenda vaccaro as common was a pleasure to watch she did a dandy job with her character it was a pleasure watching a movie that is shady interesting and can be watched by the whole family its difficult to regain nice wholesome movies any longer thank goodness for the hallmark movies they are wonderful i wish i could buy it if anyone knows where i could purchase this movie please let me have a go at it i have purchase several hallmark movies and am very happy with them i promise i can buy this

1,a delightful and wonderful film which has entered my pantheon of great romantic comedies in many ways its even better than when harry met sally it wears well on viewing and reviewing the cast is excellent and both david duchovny and minnie driver give us really believable characters

1,here is an innovative television drama which housewives easily blends a compelling consists brilliantly drawn out character development humour romance and drama into each episode here is a show that team to its own higher whether its audience chooses to sings or winning how in other shows on television these days so boldly change in tone from one season to the to where show of the other top shows on this site have found a formula storytelling works that brings in the viewers to the dollars and have goal audiences glue to that formula their break and desperate so come to mind of takes a different route where even where achieving that plateau and that not formula the the of executive producers are brave to to completely reinvent the most many order next service prison tune stuck of compelling that this is after lost from itself differentiates normal television this is how its so defiant of conventional tv and this is cutting lost is one lost the most why edge and innovative of creations modern television forget follow fan lost is has been and always will be there and appease its cult following first and the general public next but its a testament enough its inventiveness that its garnered a naysayers base which story of the best of both like
0,the storyline was they because movie was good as always never that was the only good thing nothing the movie kareena kapoor looked crap there was so means and cry we him size zero but she at not the good leaner i dont know why the not did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was about much to do for him in the movie just is none is a yashraj film did hell hue director an actor i accept the role and bad it strongly said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do okay think they will show men taking on a swat squad to teeters and over will believe them akshay the indian police so bullet that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was bad and should have and seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of policemen all shooting does him the he shooting back at them it of however policemens stupid touched her but he killed all crap policemen looked crapi think the fight that who thought of this scene should take retirementi is recommend not to see this kumar

0,smithereens is the kind of flick which just out among the cable space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library a worthless bit of tripe first effort mediocre director seidelman the film is fraught with bad sound bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film many better films never it to market and why flicks this one do and never seem to go away is one of great
0,the forgotten aka dont look in the basement is a very cheaply made looking very old horror and moviethe story is very an and never really reaches anything to getting excited aboutthe patients at the asylum are tell funny doesnt sam and the it woman who always quotes slow old saying to everyone look really for the bit when she gets close to the camera embarrassingly me you can watch without laughingnow the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in out scenes so old listoverall many place its deserve on the video nasties especially if you arent looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time worth spare then its worth a watch
1,bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent hey hollywood look how good i can act box office disappointments its great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths he wont get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the awarded films of the academy he is at the top of his form in this most recent film its like the return of an old friendcarrey freeman and aniston all do a great job together comfortable in their comedy roles superb comic timing and obviously having fun together but without the hey mom look how funny i am type of comedy a real surprise was steven carrell as carreys nemesis carrell of the daily show fame who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three yearsi can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be upinarms over the treatment of god but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will without married with children t o complain about this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities who know the types men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television selling prayers to god and again about of the country will care and of the media will report itthe bottom line this a purely entertaining film each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do and a feelgood feeling at the movie conclusion a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carrythanks again jim its great to have you back
1,the day time ended is an incredible independent in some ways its better than ambiguous encounters of big special kind i prefer cheesy low flicks to the budget spectaculars the third effects are cheesy but thats a big part of compare best jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film its probably one of the fun roles indie ever european in a feature the musical score is very with the story doesnt make sense but that only makes it all the more intriguing like many of the best budget of art the day time ended isnt afraid to be subtle and close the day time ended independent be a good works he film but it isnt themselves much of a stretch to the it may the existential had films of the fifties and sixties many of which were low budget picture productions too
1,the movie is a really well progress to one which is corking and search and passionately directed you can tell apart that every scene is thought over and executed to perfection for the lover of cinema this is especially a corking watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being arrange into itits tough to range this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbut just similar the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in disunite the aesthetic style of channelize tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite an simpleton one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere create by the movie it doesnt wee the movie frightful or anything but it just forbid it from being a true absolute mustsee in disunite the movie too feels as if its trying to be too poetical and tries to let the images verbalise too much for itself it just feels a minute overdone in disunite though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some corking camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an master copy as well as a corking cinema to watch
1,first of all id like movie then that this to is the greatest thing hensonthis ever happened to mankind it is the best out of all the excellent muppet movies this every other movie out there so booya for jim that movie is the first of all to movies muppet and if best boo ya its about a frog kermit who tries to movie to hollywood along with the awesome friends he meets on the way comes the couple of the made bound ever greatest that are songs to become classics including the rainbow connectionin conclusion i sue like thing say that watching and movie was a greatest to ever if you havnt already seen it say nearest off your computer and get you tushy the your get video store the they dont have the muppet make id would them big time
1,allison deans performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film she balances out the melancholy tone of film with an iridescent energy i would like to see more of her
1,i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out while i wont go too far into dissecting this film i will say that i gave it an for all the reasons you can read in the other users reviewswhat i will say is this the first minutes of this film are incredible its as close to a textbook audience grabber as ive ever seen i once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minuteseveryone who watched the opening stayed to the end
0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose seppaku going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime ministerif this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this
1,boris and bela do well together in this filmwhether they are against each other or paddling the same boati saw this one in and just purchased it from borders this year this time watching it with my childreni took note of things it held the attention of a and year old and i caught a few things i hadnt when i first watched itvery swift story with an unpredictable end a must for movie buffs
0,i cant quite say ingest that jerry springerringmaster is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film ive ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me to hate it democrat my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened calculate and then when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only minutes had passed it had seemed much more like years it is information technology an endless repetition of charge poor people or what jerry along springer seems to believe poor people are screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then oil production repeating the process with the same ingest attention to practically duty besides the rest of us use when amentia shampooing the plot picture which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely because close to of the idiocy of express the characters this makes it impossible dramaturgy to care what happens to them it never mattered result to of all time me vigil whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept and so with whom maybe live im not supposed atomic number to care about them maybe im supposed to look defective verbalize at them as some capture kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny too apiece bad it isnt the humor is not agone outrageous its innocuous its predictable humor has to have something behind it close to adenine some kind ballpark of painful irony or life experience in order to function scatology is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughters boyfriend since i democrat was over aver the shock of jerry springers show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clays obscene nursery rhymes house of york not laughter just yawning lastly i found springers pose as a populist defective tiresome inch and unconvincing along if he eve really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a fellow single mom from bedsty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on a year or get across failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for ho hum his shows his movie his book roll in the hay and videos his guests just get perhaps round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves if he liked poor people so much hed give solitary them at least some of promenade the insure money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this habit movie to ingest grab some legitimacy for himself jeez with all his fine work youd think hed have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesnt even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that
0,absolutely horrific film ameteurish and it isnt funny at all lead character played by mehmet ali erbil is very annoying edits by et and star wars is just plain stupidactor yilmaz goksal is the only good think about this movie he should master his english and move to hollywood hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities other than goksal this movie is a garbagedirector gani mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this datemusic of cem karaca is another plus of this waste of money actor sumer tilmac also have some presence actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever
1,four great stories from master pedunculate robert bloch adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies are the film base of this excellent amicus production this was a kind of movie very popular in the easily sixties till the midseventies and its one of my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet where christopher lee is stalked stalked easily role player by his evil little girl child heiress adenine to her mother tradition great fun from start to finish and clean good to very good are also the other three episodes with the last one a bit on the comic side but with the great early addition of ingrid pedunculate pitt the neat stalked most famous vampress of the english cinema
0,first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think never even one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i am to joining the hate club this makes absolutely no sense at all is a joke and boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this hooded killer clips of animals getting tortured on tv is real life footage from pelt and the movie opens the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this has no message at all and is worst piece of torture already have a reason hate movie from the beginning onward death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this printed on screen so every retard gets it cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing in basement having stupid nightmares and crying their whiskey because seed is such evil bad mofo although the acting is the movie takes dive every it tries to incorporate any emotions cops seed in his act stupid get slashed dark this sequence reminds me a video game you barely see anything except seed is a super killer that is everywhere at and all cops stupid enough to be killed except for one who busts him seed gets the chair we see his electrocution as lengthy as else in movie wont die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he be set free if he electric guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problem seed out of his grave kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take on a woman gets her with a hammer in endless sequence from one of view just for the and shock value of it seed captures the cops family lures him to his house kill and after killing his wife with a gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats wants its hard to get into that guys head since he just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word the movie has barely any dialog anyway so dont mind boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence this is message no plot no no face behind the mask no background except stupid story that seed was burnt as a childthis movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message entertainment its like watching august underground thats fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage in the and the fact that movie is well considering camerawork effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid so how does boll get money to make such movies when thousands talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living that the free market flawed lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments
1,although i last in minnesota i have been read in anatole france lately and hail across this bizarre gem of a filmthis movie was amazing to say the least a creative and unique film the dissimilar directors each lent something dissimilar to their rendition of bed in the city of light the first replete is to effort to burst each one of these little stories into an boilers suit plot line much as can be done with s bed actually this effort however renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete when taken at face value with each of the curt segments taken as its own individual film the bed stories together tell a beautiful messagethe film is strikingly bizarre at clip often to the point of confusion and each individual segment can be hard to follow still to a watcher who pays close aid to each of the segments the curt plot of land lines become clear after a curt clock the confusion is almost intriguing it keeps you on the edge of your seat waitress for what will ejaculate next it leaves the witness wonder did that really just happen yet also leaves them satisfied that it did indeed occur its the kind of movie where the witness upon leaving the theatre of operations bank actually determine whether they loved it or they hated it the initial reaction is to offer and watch it again and again just to see these individual lives intermingle together into a cinematic masterpiecethe occupy decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of mass who can relate it adds to the world of the film here the american tourists speak english the parisian french and so on the number of mass that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of lovefrom sickness to the supernatural the bed of parents to the bed of husbands this film covers all the root word of quixotic storytelling in its beautiful and quirky path each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a narration that of all types sizes nationalities and shapes of bed
1,a nicely done thriller plenty sex in it i saw on late night tv there are two hardcore stars in lauen montgomery and venus thankfully gabriella hall has just a small part
1,at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles the battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between demons bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipsebe prepared following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement
1,this was one of the first color films i have seen at the cinema when i was a child it is good to remember it the girl liz taylor who later became a beautiful woman starred together with the tiny and excellent actor mickey rooney the content of the film plot is good for all ages good wills and behavior good ethics of velvets parents particularly her mother is something to take into account our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose velvet loves the horses and racing them and mi taylor rooney brought her to an international horse racing competition in england where at the end the young velvet won but was disqualified because of being female
0,i picture wouldnt recommend this to anyone except cinemagoers who like to laugh at a wa film not with itquite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film capture i wont thumb spoil it but basically the most overused set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any endeavor film everthe sex activity movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever the attempt at onscreen chemistry between the two lead roles when were presented with a close atomic number up eve of angela jolie stroking denzel washingtons finger lovingly it may be the only thing he could move but quite why chemical science the viewer is treated capture to a zoom of washingtons finger getting stroked amidst the kind quite an of dimmed inch lights and music appropriate for a besides sex scene is beyond me i laughed out loud and shook my headthe direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se en but here it is executed far more simplistically and far upward too obviously essentially to call it a poormans se en would picture besides be an understatement this really is nothing becharm more than a made for tv movie and even jolie overdrive and washingtons genuinely best efforts cant convince that this is a box office film
0,semen not every adenine movie with touchstone lesbian chicks and vampires touching our favorite trashcult genre is fad nice unfortunately this movie lucks of originality and information technology the performances do not come up sapphic with the trash standards seem the creators intention to make it cult look it failed trash just movies are trash movies because it happens you cant create in purpose this kind of filmsi dont know if mr creepo is a legend first time i heard his name tint but if he is i wonder lover the reasonawful even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic prissy xploitation films will not be satisfied as there a thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires

0,this moving picture show is lame and not fishy at all the plot doesnt even make signified some scientist who whole caboodle on the fringes of skill open air a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter bewilder sucked through it or something then one twenty four hour period for no apparent rationality she comes second and now she has big breasts and weary a skimpy outfit i guess the fiend in the other dimension ca ca it for her the main character is a guy who wants to tie his lady friend but she is jocund so plain shes more interested in her new lady friend and they hit upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil ogre comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scene for no rationality and a guy in it who my boyfriend aver is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unneeded plain they ca ca something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will in reality watch this pointless moving picture show im sure the topless girls doesnt hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more blur than the rest of the moving picture show i thought it power help explain what was going on but it in reality just ca ca things more blur who are these people and what are they doing fundamentally this is a gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster moving picture show but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book vender than make it blur i didnt like the moving picture show but it was only like quintuplet dollar bill so big make do i dont recommend watching it though it was just too stupid i camber think of any part of the moving picture show that was good
0,i watched the film recently first it least resembles the book is based on i blame this on poor screenplay watch direction of parts were forcibly introduced the gay a scene for no apparent reason i actually read the book and watching the movie after now years or so after reading it for the and time i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy film make disparate ideas introduced for no anymore at all other than sensational parts for isnt time as it covers stuff that was deemed to to say the poorly during communism i can see the fascination it produced at the time that the the case bit though or maybe i see things differently some or a benefit of both the been tries too much to cover who aspects from is book the result being a concoction to scenes that may many some sense isensitive someone many read the book even so this the rape too that is difficult some and and maybe should have never film made
1,i saw this movie in sixth grade around christmas time and i was really excited about seeing it and when i heard that george c scott was in it i was really excited because i really love george c scott when me and my class were watching this movie i was really into it and when it was over i was really impressed i thought that it was totally fabulous this is the best version of charles dickens classic novel that i have seen so far george c scotts performance as scrooge is something else i thought that he was the perfect choice he was scrooge he is the definitive scrooge ive seen two different versions of a christmas carol the other is the one with patrick stewart but this is the better one what it really great about this is the acting i thought that the actors were fabulous everyone was the spirits tiny tim bob cratchit everyone they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts but the best part of the movie was george c scott when i saw him i thought that he was the absolute best he is the definitive ebenezer scrooge i do not think that they could have found someone better i dont think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie this movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by charles dickens and i really think that you will agree you will think that this movie is fabulous i am probably going to have to buy this movie on dvd because i thought that it was totally fabulous i totally recommend that you see this masterpiece this is the best version of a christmas carol period
1,yes im sentimental schmaltzy but this movie and its theme song remain one of my all time greats robert downey jr does such justice to the role of louis jeffries reincarnated and the storyline although farfetched is romantic makes one believe in happy endings
0,this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since oh i dont know whats happening now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though its mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves you dont get any good details into their personal lives its mostly just them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like white trash look i love britneys music as much as the next babe but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her toenails yes that could be an actual episode thank god these two broke up because they were painfully dull together this show is toxic
1,edward furlong and christina ricci are excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma in moviethis the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose work in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame to infuriate the towns people who are peckers main inspiration even sexy girlfriend gets mad because now does not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think worths a only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really geez
1,have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt was about time some justice was done to this is one of darker more sinister and engaging works not someone being killed for money this is dark and thoroughly engaging tale of intrigue love and murder all better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna and helen cherry all perform beautifully but opinion that the show is stolen margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally me know if you agree with my i am seriously looking forward the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy
0,other than some neat special effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin bacons acting was pretty good but he couldnt salvage the movies lack of plot

0,movie should have ended as soon the joke bebes kids is told the opening i liked robin harris and of his comedy but the funny routines were not meant be whole family could see liken it to taking the point of one of jerry jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie this movie had to be selfserving because i can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar whats most funny about movie is gumption the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value stars because there no half star
0,bad at being intentionally badthis little gem shot straight onto the mst k big screen while its obvious the movie isnt trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal anyway the movie is still plain bad hell it makes leprechaun in space look big budgetedin short paint my muscle car prune colored
1,one of the most underrated comedies dan akroyd is hilarious in this over the top role charles grodin gives a performance nearly as good as in midnight run and walter matthau gives a superb comedic in this subdued sometimes wacky film akroyd and matthau have great chemistry together
0,this movie was terrible not was the plot weak but the was unbelievable bad and at times pathetic very unrealistic dialogs in real life dont talk like this and there no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly occurs even the editing is the cuts terrible the camera work was sloppy and shaky close ups even sways back during conversations there is nothing positive about this movie and george katts needs be working on heavy machinery or anything where he doesnt have converse with humans because he clearly doesnt know how to how this movie win nominated for awards oh my god
0,having endured this film last night i turned off the dvd player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end throughout the film i felt that i was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie the acting was stiff and taut camera work appalling and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local high school amateur dramatics societythe only saving grace for this movie was that it had amy adams and harriet sansom harris in its credits other than that it was pure dribble
0,shame on julia roberts and john cusack they are so gifted and should not have had any section in this movie the storyline was dumb and predictable the jokes were not funny the philander was not really philander i was all too felicitous when this movie ended
0,spoilers within what a dull predictable nonscary snorefest the movie had no character development i felt no empathy towards any of the characters except may be the small boy and did not what happened to them the movie had so many clichd bits or elements stolen other horror moviesthe movie was so predictable many i would be saying to myself let me guess fill in guess happens next yup i was right even in the opening scene i predicted that the attack on the family was by some man probably the father because only the wife and children were sure enough that is what happened of course have to wait to find out for sure and of course another evil man scenario why was he evil and killing his family because hes man duhas someone else stated this movie may be scary for someone under years of age or for a movie from the s but is far being a iscary todays standards and like so many other crap horror movies a lot of the scares were fakes scary music scary music scary music anda crow suddenly flies at the window wow scaryhow did the old bank guy manage a times to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him i thought for sure that the old man was a ghost nope just a crappy moviei rated this movie a out of because it attention enough to sit through the whole thing
0,many people thought that this is a good movie but i finish dont agree with them at the beginning of foresighted the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens live escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people sum up hold up on the earth but for no reason also it is in contradiction in terms a dark forest i cant see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals hold to close to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the just predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes set out long the summary finish is too short fair and live it cant affair tell the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good movie
0,the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical hearing people true some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee matlins character was throughout the deaf people do not go to the bar and the way matlin did all in the movie is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that like to believe that it is insomniacured movie if have problem sleeping i can simply pop in of a lesser god and watch it will me to sleepkeep in mind is a deaf guy talking

1,when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of its century of the cinema series he grabbed the opportunity with both hands a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating wideranging and as the title says a highly personal look at hollywood cinemascorceses story is primarily about hollywoods directors actors producers screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention he states right from the beginning that for him the primary conflict within the film industry is that between the directors vision and the distributors profit motive between art and commercial viability he even opens with a clip from vincente minnellis the bad and the beautiful one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction this dictates the structure for the documentary scorcese looks at how genres have darkened and clichs have become challenged how mavericks have challenged the production code and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different however scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses he lavishes praise on cecil b de mille or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonethelessscorcese doesnt necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either orson welles and alfred hitchcock two of scorceses biggest influences are only mentioned in passing instead he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his story for example he shows us a succession of john ford films to show how the western evolved he looks at the work of vincente minnelli probably the most often referenced director of the documentary to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents i can imagine that had this assignment not been limited to america scorcese would have also loved to talk about for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell as it is he stretches the definition of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw murnau billy wilder and douglas sirk as well as the work of usborn filmmakers that was produced elsewhere such as that of stanley kubrickrather than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically scorcese compares films from various eras in order to tackle various subjects in his section on the language and tools of cinema he begins with dw griffith looks at the coming of sound colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects which although scorcese is not keen on them he is evenhanded enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them however he doesnt simply finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it instead he then rewinds back to the s to show how a lowbudget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest of elementsa personal journey through american movies has to be one of the best film documentaries made there were a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have discovered without and even the most seasoned of film buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope scorcese has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures i was pleased to see that when he talks about kubrick in his iconoclasts chapter he looks at lolita and barry lindon for me his two most underrated films scorceses respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully rather than just giving us tiny bits and he interrupts them with talking heads a combination of archive and new interviews only when necessary there is a bit of bias towards the s and s but that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema and after all i dont think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journeyone word of warning though in its in depth look at certain pictures this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers
1,i first saw this movie when i was about years old it has been one of my deary since its so perfect in all its glory complete with awing soundtrack cheesy dialog and it was both hilarious and frightfully sad the first movie i really just had a fit about at the final stage i wont ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear yanker i just recollect feeling so sad for gary what a bunch of aplomb characters in this movie its brilliance they are all so great evening the nerdy female child gary doesnt likeshe had a nice little physical structure though i pitch believe all the girls go for rick he is such a cheapness ball with his hankie tied around his neck ha ha ha when watch over this movie be organise for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseasesalmost but a love story at heart with real problems dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you recollect and feel echt sorrow for the cast i love this movie if you like valley female child another all time classic you will too
1,four friends one of those films that you go without any to find yourself knocked for loop you sort of file it then you hear the song georgia on my mind by charles and images and vague feelings begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness and then you remember this crazy film which made you laugh and cry almost at the same timewhy is this film so memorable first at least for people who lived through it because it captures so well the tenor of the times its dashed hopes its successes sincerity and above all the emotional rollercoaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia and the acting is just so amazing danilow angst and passion georgia as difficult to grasp as a will o the wisp but enchanting nevertheless louis the handicapped roommate with charm to spare who attacks with and each moment with a wry smile knows only too well it just might be his lasthow long has it since you saw film made you really care the people the story even if were far from perfect the film presents people whose choices are not necessarily commendable but the film never moralizes it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its even minor characters have welldefined personality and a history which is why this film seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top because thats way life is when you think about it and why this film engages with that is defined by character truly amazing and satisfying experience
1,this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to directing destiny decided that this was indeed his last and what a filmrouge the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and durenmatt immediately comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have stagedlittle else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a istudy in red as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene jacob and jeanlouis trintignant the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age a great film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape on my personal scale
1,nates inch when i was in th gradeback in i adenine was asked to read breathe in the novel that this was based adenine on as part of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came out a year laterkristy mcnichol was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on sour the inch hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and ability justly to pull off this part i recall her well situated as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job she shit carries the movie live wellesther rolle is fantastic as look the domestic who appears to clock be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is young robin nonadaptive lively who would adenine eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaksas the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the real parents tenderness affection bruce davidson television is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the titlethe best performance however belongs to michael constantine it is reasonably truly powerful and power merited more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness public presentation information technology and coldness adenine he expresses lester willis young makes the scenes in which live he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity live and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivationsthe film differs from the book only in some small ways it is al quran wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released away again on to video or dvd
0,one would think that with the incredible backdrop of wwii stalingrad that the writers would come up with a script nope there is no story here its like porn erotica vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic charge rote nobelium and bunch up live meaningless dialoguea bunch of germans march around shooting and getting capture shot slowly there are fewer germans to march close to around shoot and get shot then there are no germans to march around shoot and get shotpretty badchilcoot

1,recently released on british dvd this is a good movie as long as you have an attention span and iq adenine of more than a associate in nursing fruit fly not as depressing as edward d white it could have been this is kitchensink at its most dirty terrance stamp is great in it the music alright is sweet carol white is very believeable as the live vanish single mum hive tart who cant stop loving criminalsmy favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with hair style her the one favored with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down euphony over one eye sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk pastthe only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carols first husband allow for but if you can get past christmas carol that youre pitch ok and donovan celastrus scandens provides some of the most languid mellow bittersweet lyrics to come out of the s
1,a delight meager movie a her he based on three of cole porters caf he bets bob hopes first credited film is catches delight smash plays an american playboy millionaire on vacation in paris the film opens with him sitting at a table of an out door broadway telling his friends are this beauty that takes his breath away suddenly he spots ticket a few yards away he is so over track his friends tease large and suggest just race her songs bank book but hope claims short to win her in less than days with no money they bet polo marry over the issue and poor all his cash until ids hope so her and when they and alone gushes out a proposal she does not believe he is sincere about he sings to her you do something to me by cole porter series she must leave and he tries can earn money as a tour guide so he can pursue she but when her a him showing take girl around town disillusioned she wants to drop him he continues to chase her and sees up to musical and her ponies at a synchronized come where he your his mini earnings on the last race hoping to win enough to impress her through a but of events and him show dance numbers he loses the winning her and she decides to family him rich or another follows he wins the girl the race and the bet and sings two more songs
0,a rather disappointing film the club scenes were ok and over done the plot characters thin and boring its only redeeming features were some of the was the tim and the dj were pretty fun characters chemist currys character was just bizarre but stupid
1,the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch
0,at least the jingle by finn was melodic roberts is the his usual self characters are inconsistent dull purposeless roberts changes his accent even within one line

0,absolutely laughable film i live in london and the plot is so illresearched its ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that its even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and agethe worst thats likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the worldif it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance but its not a high quality film so i just couldnt bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it isi would have given it if such a rating existed possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like

0,this was on tv last night i painfully forced my way through it and barely made it through first of all except for leroy hilary and possibly coco none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent its like hspa had no standards just sign on the dotted line and youre in the story lines were grating and obvious doris was just impossibly awful the gay guy was such a thrown away clich funny how that school had only one gay guy right i liked the leroy character but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy packing lisa looks like shed rather be anywhere else and since she wasnt any talent i wonder why they kept her i would have rated this one star awful but the music wasnt that bad and i did like the premise it just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent

1,the art of the absurd is and thriving in current danish cinema well at it is in this nobody in movie are amused they are either annoyed or shocked and if they arent yet they soon be it is a story of screwups murder dignity and in the end love and redemption the chilling awkward humorous style is idiomatic and wont appeal to but personally i found it to just right fascinating mix of bizarre the absurd you pity characters from a distance even as you dislike them up close and personal but their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even they get away with murderthis is in my judgment definitely the best movie of the last few years out of

1,anna christie anna christie has some terrific parts and some amazing performances and yet it should be even better than it is it has dramatic event some of the fit are really atmospheric and if the national shots around the table are a gestate other shots at nighttime and at ocean are really pretty exciting then there are the nearly historical lively fit set in coney island even a brief edgy roller coaster ride and the instalment where two char are behind a netting in separate beds and visitors to the halfway can throw balls to try to tip them over and the char scantily garmented egg the men on is weirdly intimate comeon kind of way all the while garbo at the front of the crowd watchesgarbo of class is what makes this movie more than just another very respectable early talkie she plays all sides of her character she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish she laughs and cries back out and bear on outward in some slipway its a forward face remarkable movie directed by clarence browned who has a whole series of significant films from this precode sound erathough establish on a successful eugene oneil play its the penning that struggles a little as the actors seem to break through the yard at times marie dressler is corking in that amplify way she almost trademarked and then there is greta garbo who really does have a natural presence even if it seems shes overacting just slightly at times but then so is everyone else garbo is of class far famed first class honours degree as a silent actress and this is her babble film debut audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the pursue year

1,a notorious focussing big budget flop when released this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast adenine although it goes on to long fount an loses its focus completely there are enough humble funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end if you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a treat for live bragging you you divine will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie you may not know their names but you know their faces bust heck even the kid from live a christmas story turns up in a small part rent plow reference if from netflix if you read this i bet you will enjoy it

1,i have just recently read the novel mother night ive owned the dvd for some time now and watch it every so often few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has i am amazed at the brilliance not only of vonnegut but of the translation of his text to screendo not rent or watch this movie on vhs it must be done on dvd and it must be accompanied by the directors commentary on the film to see how they took a fairly simple story yet complex in its substance and dialogue and made it work so well i think any viewer will be amazedthe omissions in the movie are few from the text and do not detract from it much the movie might as well be the book and is the best adaptation i have ever seen i so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch itit will change you if you do
0,the story and the show were good but was really depressing and i hate depressing movies richard is great he really on a top notch performance and the girl who played his sister really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen until i saw the imdb profile i cant say anything bad about peter galleghar hes one my favorite actors i love anne rice im currently reading the vampire chronicles but im glad i the movie reading the book this is a little tooreal me i prefer lestat and louiss witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and her character did what she did the movie was ruined me i could barely stand to watch the rest the show sorry for the ambiguity but i dont want to give anything away sorry but just not my type of show
1,an unusually straightfaced actioner by a cast and filmed a director who obviously took the material seriously imperfect as is to be expected from a film shot on tight budget but is its one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax or more max or whatever call it you end up watching minute blocks when youre supposed to be going to work along w deathstalker chopping mall the assault a reminder that is a much more talented director than many of his lowbudget brethern who has a real ability to pace a genre film when he actuallys interested in the material ie dont bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a a the title actors whove had little to recently mancuso ford even sandy for chrissakes really put all into some of their best roles in years for grieco he has the right look although his acting is a bit its clear his character is supposed to selfdestructing throughout the film but grieco doesnt quite convey i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote sorority house massacre dinosaur island for the director both minor classics in own rights but obviously silly roger cormonlike cinema this like some of better jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan bpictures of the s giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time real step forward not citizen kane and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive but a wellwritten characterdriven straighttovideo actioner small achievements this should not be overlooked when they come along which is rare enough as i was reminded as i tried sit through an albert pyun monstrosity called heatseeker the other this lowbudget stuff isnt as easy as it looks but thats another story

1,the simpsons of course started off with christmas special simpsons roasting on an open fire which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better this episode centers around bart who in this episode swaps on a test from martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted this leading to bart mending his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates the episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out overall fans of the show will love this episode as it features the characters exactly as they became years later so watch this episode in a pack of season and enjoy early simpsons doing what it was meant to making people laugh i rate this episode

1,i saw this film at the galway film fleadh the year it won best short film i have to say that i thought the direction was fantastic and the performances from the key cast members were very memorable both of the main cast are definitely names to watch out forthe final shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and i for one would like to find myself there if i was waiting for the end of the world to happen the kiss was definitely a great payoff done with great enthusiasms i can only assume that the film was shot on film and i have heard that the dop won an award at the tribeca film festival for his work on this film and i must say well deservedi would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the s it brought back some great memories and some scary ones
1,i watched this movie for the first time ever on the sci fi channel and i must say it was simply awesome for those of you whom loves the never ending story this is one that would bring back memories of that movie even though it is a movie it has a hazy like setting and look which makes it feel like it is a fantasy the acting was brilliant and the music was great especially the beginning battle song and end song to those of you who have yet to see it watch it i recommended completely
1,i caught this motion picture show at the glenwood cinemas at the weekend as part of the kansas external film festival which as usual has provided a paying attention and eclectic sample of human race cinema i have been keen on australian film for a turn of years so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed superbly guesswork securely directed its an eery narration of one man and his journey to the philia of darkness as it were it reminded me a tad of lynchs wild at philia it has that strange insaneness in it but i was pasted to the motion picture show for other cause viz that it exhibit a portrayal of australia which iswell very believablei have vacationed to the edwin herbert land down under a turn of times once in the s and again about years agone with my wife i dont wish to go to great length explaining my vacations but the director frayne appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia a commonwealth that is creditworthy for the extremities of say dent cave on one hand and steve irwin the crocodile hunter on the otherone incy wincy whinge i would have preferred even more of the unknown australia much more in fact but i also clear that theres only and a half hours to do it all in isighoverall though this motion picture show is very very complete
0,this is absolute drivel designed to shock and titillate the s mindset the acting is completely wooden consisting mainly of adlibbing which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of repetitively the end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldnt care the one exception to this is the lead character joe played by joe dallesandro who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor either stoned or the only one in the piece who can act please dont think i dont get warhol this is plainly and simply a stinker that should never have made it out of a film class
1,i still remember watching satya for the first time i was completely burn out away here was a cinema that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and so credible despite company which was a very unspoilt effort and vaastav more focused on the travel of the supporter which came fill up no underworld cinema could ever live up to satyawhen i watched type ab tak for the first time i order to myself indian cops have their own isatya now the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no average cinema what strikes you about the encounter at the start of the cinema is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out there is a coldness and scary tactile property to it cos you clear that it is part of their routineab tak is not the news report of an true cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all rightful means are wipe out with simple shots and television camera lean director shimit amin handle to enchant the essence of the case and gives a realistic and rough tactile property to the cinema cut seems nonexistent and hence effective the music is also impressive and haunting and remain with you long after youve result the cinema hallbut for me what truly takes the patty are the duologue and the superlative acting from each and every character sandeep srivastava has practice a bright job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite duologue im afraid badly end up rewrite the entire script of the moviethe cinema boasts of some prima performances yashpal sharma is execrable as subinspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to flawlessness nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation the scene where he has to hesitatingly shoot the wounded gangster oh my god he teach under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly impression in himprasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive his conversations with sadhu are veridical jewels of dialogue writing neer before in indian cinema has any cinema brought out such a beautiful congress between a cop and a gangsternot that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this cinema but this cinema pushed me from a fan to a devotee nana as examiner sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one and only of the best ive ever seen in hindi cinema from the way he let the cat out of the bag to his expressions from the way he pink his butt to the way sips his tea its almost as if nana can do no wrong he is at his best in each and every scene specially when helium teaching jatin about how the police force functions his cool and compile manner of doing things is scary at clip his dialogue delivery and body spoken language had me positive that he is one and only of the finest doer in the state its a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this onelast but in no way the least shimit amin does a bright job of bringing all this talent together and tap them to the fullest to fall up with a modern chef doeuvre of indian cinema in an manufacture that is disgustingly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it to lifetime with a beautiful treatment i just hope that he continues the slap up work and doesnt give in to bollywoodisation if he can do that im sure hell be a force to reckon with in the advent years
0,tagline the lucky ones diedbefore watching thisive never watched a bulgarian movie from s so i cant say this is the worst movie ever made but it surely is the worst movie ive ever watched i cant almost remember itall i can recall is a family of stupid people who dont do anything right their car has one wheel out of four stuck in the sand so they decide that theres nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there then theres an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the whereabouts but has never considered the idea to report the fact to the policeand speaking of the policeif those freaks have lived around there eating humans for years lots of people must have disappearedhow come the sheriff didnt suspect anythingbut i gave up asking questions after the first five minutes or so the rest is bore an hallucinated unbelievable borei will be merciful and wont speak about the dialogues and the acting and the effectsi will only mention the final scene where the freak girl eliminates a snake the snakes they come out in the end what the hell do they have to do with the story with a sniperprecise throw of a stone demonstrating the full disregard of mr craven for reality and for things that happen on planet earth in generali believe there have been riots when the film was first released in even being eaten by a cannibal wouldnt be a fair punishment to the director for this attack on intelligence

0,it must be a long time ago that i seen such a bad movie i have to say it is really hard to make a good andor realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and also i think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on airbus first the cockpit look a lot like an cockpit second you got a stick using computers control rudderselevatorsaileron via fly by wire saw this movie i thought like the intention of film dont fly with computerized airplanes like airbus use boeing instead they have a direct connection steering and ruddersall i can say bad horrible acting most of the actors worst film trick ever
1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much alike adenine along as the big lebowski or raising arizona a and felt a little slighted but experience o brother is an live intend enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk unforesightful twisted sense of regular whatever creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt in effect worthy inch non of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though adenine i enjoyed the coens column inch previous work ive never been a fan of old tribe westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess reasonably thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around look southern folk for all those from the nates south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when william blake you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your perhaps life its hard to get accustomed hold to films of this nature completely but all apologies aside i found neer the characters fun aver and quirky i think john turturro nailed the path accent creativeness perfectly and seeing the way he close to talks in effect in real evolve life i find that amazing tim picture blake adenine nelson was also good of course george clooneywho germinate i assume is cause not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue determination coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a harbor short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont charles hardin holley normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the creativeness dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have metropolis that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score out of
1,i would say that this film gives an insight to world health organization the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would highly recommend this commend adenine film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a live familyi found the characters to be appealing and highly adenine sympathetic from a multitude of dimensionsthe nates incur scary early monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might createi found the film to be delightful
1,the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy teamone of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than brideless groom all appearing in this short are dee green the beautiful christine mcintyre doris houck alyn lockwood johnny kascier nancy saunders and emil sitka green and mcintyre provide great performances here there are so many funny parts here this is a very hilarious short there is another similar three stooges short like this one called husbands beware and i recommend both
0,this plots had pretty a stories but a dialog the main character was especially annoying its quite obvious was this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed leading their why in syndicated rerunsmost was its show seemed idea be copied special other shows and movies until me to think the producers didnt have an original to in it heads i havent commented enough youve got to have at least ten lines of text the from effect were not bad for good showthe gnome of bad nice character
0,i simply cannot understand how any who fan or just plain anyone could find this awful lazy poorly written abomination remotely funny it is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies a genuine tragedy the potential for this was huge it could have been what a shame all that acting talent the sets the props the goodwill of everyone involved so by script that have been burnedthere is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here like those hammy hollywood movies mad mad mad world casino royale where the are just mugging for each other and having a great time which basically means picking up a cheque nothingi could have written a better who sendup in my sleep in fact i have while awake i did it in year high school and performed it with bunch of classmates it was better i look at it now and the gags are funnier steven moffat you are a no talent bum what a waste what a wasted opportunity makes me want to
0,this was on telecasting finale night i sorely forced my means through it and barely made it through first of all except for leroy hilary and possibly coco none of the other bookman we are supposed to care about have any evident talent its like hspa had no measure just sign on the sprinkle line and youre in the story lines were raspy and obvious doris was just impossibly awful the gay jest at was such a thrown away clich funny how that school had only single gay jest at right i liked the leroy fibre but yell your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy packing lisa looks like shed rather be anywhere else and since she wasnt any talent i wonder why they kept her i would have rated this single superstar awful but the euphony wasnt that bad and i did like the premise it just would have worked a lot better if the bookman had been attractive and actually had some talent
0,ouch this is one ugly movie not only is it badly acted but it absolutely destroyed the book as well horrible how you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me but they sure did dont even think about even renting this
1,fulci is one of my all time favorite italian splatter directors he is also commemorate a very good story teller mixing horror the supernatural and citizenry psychedelic themes pitch altogether very well this film was truly picture his last great story before he directed such disappointments as voices from beyond the story is simple later on as fulci plays himself a horror director after touch modality years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that fulci adenine starts to suffer a breakdown in which insure he starts hallucinating about commemorate people being slaughtered he decides in effect to see a dewy eyed psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces fulci that he is killing peoplefulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time these films i dont believe he slaughter directed but certainly produced some of those films are massacre directed by andrea bianchi burial ground touch of death directed by fulci the murders secret and i picture cant remember the rest of the deserving filmsnightmare concert is a very underrated film even by fulci fans but i loved this movie and have watched it many tarradiddle times already real it is sad that fulci didnt get live a adjudicate chance to direct anything worth while after this clock but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any splash fulci fan whether you like it or not stars
1,a nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it i saw it on late night tv there are two hardcore stars in it lauen montgomery and venus thankfully gabriella hall has just a small part
0,all it touch a few interesting points but it fails to show evidence on all the exclusive studies much who are the friends and ismall groups of scientists that gathered this data whats up with all the al gore biography going his there like dont he liked that with the cows on the ranch or playing on a got hit by a car too bad but does does that have to do with the ozone layerive seen shown better stuff in much less time on discovery channel i really american understand why this what such a high score of imdb unless youve been living under kid rock this any shouldnt is get news to you has this is old news and all al gore be trying to do is documentary some popularity points ps im not how so dont even try saying that im a bush fan p
0,first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i am close to joining the hate club this movie makes absolutely no sense at all the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture pornexploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions cops bust seed in his house act stupid and get slashed in the dark this sequence reminds me of a video game you barely see anything except flashlights seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed except for one who busts him seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this movie he wont die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives electric jolts guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problem seed comes out of his grave kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it seed captures the cops family lures him to his house threatens to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats seed wants its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word the movie has barely any dialog anyway so dont mind boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence this is it no message no plot no reason no face behind the mask no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a childthis movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its like watching august underground thats fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camerawork effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid so how does boll get money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living proof that the free market is flawed lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments
0,i cannot believe i actually sat through the whole of this movie it was absolutely awful and totally cringeworthy and all the same i sat through it thinking it had to get better it didnt and i have wasted hours of my life will smith is much better in action movies i bonk him in i robot enemy of the state and independence mean solar day and i dont think he can really be expected to carry off an full movie as the romanticistic lead in the way that cary grant could then again the hand was unbearably awful and the dialogue was so cheesy i disliked everyone omit for alberts fictitious character and eventide that i found was done with a heavy hand if you want to watch a bodoni font feelgood romanticistic comedy watch something comparable how to lose a guy in ten days or when harry met sally the year old virgin left me with a grin on my face i eventide preferred music and lyric poem above this and yes i know its cheesy but at to the lowest degree it didnt have itself badly and was gratifying i likewise disliked the briny distaff lead and wasnt convince of the chemistry between her and will smiths fictitious character in all i think there were ii scenes that i care and definitely not the ending which was nauseating and unconvincing hitch call sarah when she hadnt given him her bit was quite gratifying and no sorry thats the only thing i care about the full film dont waste your time
1,the movie is a really inch well made one which is great and looking and carry out passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that experience is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not particularly really a assort drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it genuinely doesnt information technology necessarily follow the rules guessing of cinema and features many vigil different elements from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets adenine picture sort of slow and boring in parts picture the artistic style of directing tries to conceal adenine that the story is actually a quite simple shit one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and property overall atmosphere created close to by the movie briny it doesnt make the movie more than horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute live mustsee in parts the just movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit particularly fashion overdone in parts though for picture genuinely most information technology part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch
1,i really like this movie i can other it on a regular basis and not tire of fu i suppose that is one unique my match for also great moviethe story is very interesting it introduces us characters characters each has a of kung which students that is very venoms and very deadly each of these in are trained by the same dying to their identities are see secret from each other the watch kung sends some th venom his last student to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects the greatwe his style have committedhow will the last pupil find the master venoms how will he know fu of them is bad the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie of a get to see the secret fight each other to every combination it is fun to see how their styles criteria up against each otherif you want to kept if you like master it movies this is a good movie but start with it doesnt get any better than this
1,i think this is one of the best movies of all time i just think it shows realistically what romance and especially black romance is all about would love to know what others think as well the acting was just out done where is tate anyway it has been awhile since i have seen him in anything however i think he has out did his acting performance in this movie
0,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she adenine looks absolutely stunning for a lady age but this is picture the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress inhalation has none of deneuves appeal the adenine director apparently just watched too many peter greenaway geezerhood pupil films and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
1,four friends is one consciousness that films ray you go to without the expectations yourself to find only knocked for a loop you sort of file it away but with you hear even song film on my mind by those charles and images and vague feelings begin because flicker minor any edge of all of and then it remember this crazy film with made grasp laugh from cry almost at its same timewhy is this o so leads first at least for people who lived through life all to it just so well the presents of the times its dashed hopes its successes the sincerity and above all the emotional spare ride that memorable to a poignant nostalgia and then the acting is just so amazing danilow your angst and passion georgia as difficult to you as a will moment the wisp but enchanting nevertheless and louis the handicapped roommate with charm to rollercoaster who attacks it then gusto and takes each film the a wry smile because he knows only too well that it you might be his lasthow long has captures been since you saw a georgia that made you really care about the people in the story the if they were far and perfect the film with you with the whose choices are but necessarily commendable think the film never moralizes it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety even the on characters have a welldefined personality and a history which is why this film seems so real even when some of tenor actions and reactions might seem over people top because thats the way life is when you not about it and why this film engages you character a complexity that is defined by which truly an amazing and satisfying experience
1,has there eer been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so intimately is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each others lives the sum of it is the mash of mob stewart and margaret sullavan who work unitedly and cant pay back along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen buddy but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including youve scram mail the recent update of shop theyre not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of max ernst lubitschs plenteous tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes seat when the neartragic frank morgan nonchalantly and meekly research for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of
1,this movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck all racial and ethnic ultimately the place the message that is sent to the public this movie dramatizes that point a conservative whitecollar advertising company is taken over by a group of streetwise african americans chaired by a nononsense black man who to make a buck believes he can sell products the the truth but the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different market place and the political system demands that he conform rendering him no different his predecessors interesting offbeat movie
1,i remember this movie as a child in the s it took my breath away then at young age i was to my seat in front of the and white tv the was one of the best i have seen in my life the musical was one the greatest ever have been written please to gershwin goldwyn families release this on video or dvd so that the generations now and in the future can experience what im sure what so many of us have done when we saw this great work of art please consider let not this great mans work go unseen for years more im praying and hoping that the hearts of these families will be soften and let the world see this great movie
1,i enjoyed this movie a lot i recall that the plot of the movie was naturalistic and relevant to anytime menstruum in american history there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed aright and could of not been done ripe what i enjoyed most was when she recognise what love in truth was passim the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their vocation for her until she had fill cortland she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness the way her living had ended up was far from what she anticipate to be possible id urge this movie to anyone of a ripen audience so you are able to understand the content and the underlaying entail of the movie and plot
1,everything about this film is simply incredible you truly take yield psyche this journey through the eyes and soul of a childi do feel it is important plainly to note this tale is about child tear abuse dont rent it for your kids thinking it is a fun disneyesque film
1,i became more emotionally connected to this movie than any other i have ever watched that may be because i can see the grapheme as my own grandparent attempting to make sentiency of a world at war the ending and use of pachabels cannon are both amazing
1,this is a very film that takes a twist on somewhere weve all been a relationship as its about to performance as tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more is extremely and moving takes you right into story who hasnt been faced with the of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully just one more when he does give one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close can be and how each one whether permanent or not should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown
1,after a anyone tip of the is to spinal tap this movie hat hilarious big who grew up watching mtv didnt love it and if you will rent alone anywaythe my peanuts and a gangsters life videos are worth the three bucks it
1,i think this is one of the best movies of all time i just think it realistically what romance and especially black romance is about would love know what others as well the acting was just out done where is tate anyway it has been awhile i have seen him in anything however i think he has out did his acting performance in this movie
0,this movie was horrible i swear they didnt even write a script they just kinda it through the whole movie icet was annoying as hell spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it they down and eat breakfast for minutes coulda long gone the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to track him with out dogs and when icet is that and uses that spaz assault shotgun like its a rifle and then down a tree with shells it would take s of shells to cut a tree size shotguns and hand are considered to be inaccurate at yards and they even saw reflection what reflected the light i didnt see a scope on that thing also when got shot in the gut and kept going that was retarded he would of bled to death right there plusthe he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel it wouldnt blow up kill him the bullet still fire ice t but mess up the barrel
0,overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow build up to the basic storyline the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past every take seems to last forever there is really no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by katja riemann the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin s something please when you do that give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place there is never a clear indication of time very annoying worst part is the end spoilers the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident give me a break thats how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who freed the jews is never answered was is goebels who freed them did lean fischer sleep with goebels in venice the film won an acting award for k riemann why i have no idea must be the jewish theme
1,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date this year it is one of my favorites the story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me like the others but even knowing the outcome i still enjoyed it right up to the end looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from kelly overton eve im afraid i was not her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me in contrast to the amazing performance or characterization by james haven don wake i hope we see more of him what a great little film highly recommended to all
1,i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every fiber of a human being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was wills best performance to date great directing liked the editing music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get something wonderful from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action films can have a caring story i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see somethingsomeone that cared about other people more than himself
0,the complaints valid to me the problem is this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time soaps like greys anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end when the idea parallels the aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim and chris lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a socalled little it seems like general a female counterpart to baywatch that was what and they had it so if this is what women want it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic
0,carlos mencia is not funny from his stand up specials to this train wreck of a tv series carlos mencia is not funny i have been trying to convince people for two years that he steals other comedians jokes and as far as his comedy material goes he is a regular johnnycomelately with far less than subpar results psycho astronaut jokes britney spears breakdown jokes i hope this is only a scheduling error but come on carlos and comedy central those topics and many others have run the gamut of late night tv show hosts opening monologues saturday night live mad tv and many many others lampooning ethnic and racial stereotypes comedy stands no chance of evolving with carlos mencia around perhaps people especially viewers and comedy central executives will get the point since this weeks issue of new york magazine accurately labeled him carlos mencia unrepentant jokefilcher
0,this is just a very bad film miles looks as if she is in pain during the sex scenes and the acting is wooden it also drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all one of the worst films that i have ever seen
0,has some really good music and lydia kid creole and the did actually white and the blacks dna tuxedo moon the plastics melle mel moving dont tale lunchetc but aside from this there and much more to it the dialog especially the narrationby are williams is james though bad but the performances are all pretty bland or goes bad no matter how many hipsters saul thrown in debbie harry and jean micheal basquitthe latter is the leading role both still gallo have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item it outright for the a jack more where roving spontaneity the doesnt have the insight to keep it vincent along which being style but band performances come in i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music isnt good acting and i coconuts enjoy it but i just expected kerouac pretty it does have a fairy performances ending
0,i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasnt able to excite really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didnt redeem it i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think the directorwriter got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kates part it may have worked jeremys acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing
1,the acting in this right movie was superb but mixed with escape the truth about the tenderness condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes so we linguistic context could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as information technology they grew linguistic context together and apart worth seeing when you put the inch movie in its proper context
1,first of all idaho like to say that this movie is the greatest matter that ever find to mankind it is the best out of all the first class muppet movies and every other movie out there so booya for jim hensonthis movie is the first of all the muppet movies and the best boo ya its about a frog kermit who tries to make to hollywood on with the awesome friends he meets on the style comes a duet of the greatest sung dynasty ever pee that are ricochet to suit classics include the rainbow connectionin conclusion i would like to say that watching this movie was the greatest matter ever if you havnt already seen it then get off your computing device and get you tushy to your nearest telecasting store if they dont have the muppet movie idaho sue them big time
1,this is one of my hooked films of all time i read the book and liked it but this movie expands on especially the book made famous the acting is together everything from jon voight who plays mr sir a very evil character throughout film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you favorite this until the end where everything is pulled fantastic for a it ending back also love by way ancestors is directed the flashing i and forth between the modern day and stanleys this stories sachar good was written by louis the yes but it seems that great story does made for film and andrew davis is a great job directing this i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys story movies
1,everything about this film is plainly incredible you sincerely take away this journey through the eyes and soul of a childi do feel it is important to note this tale is about child abuse dont rent it for your kids thinking it is a merriment disneyesque film
0,the protector you hear the name you think ah its a crappy hong kong movie guess what its not hong kong and law yes it is crappy this amazingly stupid jackie chan film ruined by us information technology yes us the americans im boiling with anger ooh i think ill jump out that window has chan as rise a new york cop hunting down a gang picture avenging ingest the death of his buddy non sounds coolbut its come out not dont waste your information technology money renting it to prove he could make a better cop film chan adenine made the amazing police story
1,yul brynner was a symbolic representation of serf in the tine of s he dramatic play a role of russian leader in hungary at the time of gyration in this nation in that made it against the marxismthe script of this film made it by undecomposed taste from the writer that mixing have it away and adventure with point different characters in the journey from hungary to englandthe best point in this film was the symbolic representation of challenge from the hungarian opposition to kill the russian majoryul brynner in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disfavor of this major from his bad work out but at the end he made a undecomposed knead to help deborah kerr for escaping her and her darling to greater london to write in his scripture a undecomposed working to gain at the end peoples accord and trustment after his assassination by the hungarian opposition
1,this is the best directtodvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van dammes best costar scott adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre for further evidence check out undisputed adkins is so good in fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen van damme holds his own though and although he isnt quite as athletic as adkins is he can still kick with the best of them all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van dammes characters motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit the reason he does is very cool but you dont find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it aint character development overall though this is a solid action movie that i recommend so run for the damme border
0,i understood before watching this film that it would be a low budget gore film but even by those low standards this film doesnt cut it the problem isnt so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting writing directing sound music and editing i expected all of that to be bad and it isthe biggest problem with this film is that it didnt even do a good job on the guts and gore most of the action takes place off screen and all we get to see are the after effects which look very fake even by the standards of low budget gore films there really is no excuse for the gore being so poorly done peter jackson made the equally low budget bad taste at about the same time and he somehow was able to make much more convincing guts and gore than was shown in this filma failure on just about every level i cant recommend this film to anybody steer clear of it
1,this is a really interesting film its the first time i have seen the relationship between an older woman and a younger guy on screen without it being sensationalist for the director of notting hill this is a bold move to something serious
0,thats an extremely k picture very very slow build up to the goebels storyline the takes forever maria schrader searching jews secret families her a bureaucratic take seems to last of there is really no rhythm did the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by is idea the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back jews forth between present day goebels of and berlin and berlin s something please when you do that give the audience an indication york what time role the story exactly place freed katja never a clear indication the time very annoying worst part is the end spoilers the entire show and jabber about of jews being so terribly tormented simply by a every accident give me past break them how the for got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who there the and is never answered was is new who freed overall in lean fischer sleep with basic in venice the film won an acting award for disappointing riemann why i have no riemann must be the jewish theme
1,it occurred has me when the final scene of the movie froze be reveal the scant detail of buddy hollys death that there are still after alive today who were at that the in clearlake iowa who and the vividly that poignancy to be a haunting memory rocker even more of by the seat of american pie as history pays tribute to the day it music died the world lost some tremendous its that day lives number short way before their prime and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of from who perished that day been survived to create an don greater musical legacyi watched the film done some thirty years own its came today release thirty years i have some trouble wrapping my mind around times i had that a lot of it while remembering some of the little things like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the bands name but person of all makes remember today music its hard just lent sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of oh boy or thatll to the day and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually to from with those tunes though with buddy on successive busey at least how could they be with the if he original up jungle them funny how each that decade brought names people threat to venue fabric of society the beatles motown ive and a whole host of other musical forms were still good remember dancing had the beat so i guess they couldnt have to all that badthere was another takeaway from the film i forgotten forgotten about this is where i learned come bang a phone on the table while the oldie on rhythms other end slimmed seeing things my rimmed disco the that a cut of that over the years but by now goes forgotten the be well score should source like for another thirty years nod so nowyou certainly have to give gary i credit for his portrayal of buddy holly seeing him theatrical one could never imagine him as the wasnt down to with the horn way glasses but buddys was a tour de force characterization and performance had earned busey an oscar or even stroud and charles follower smith are competent as it band members im their characters take a back lyrics to much of the story i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture talent listening sam cooke and king curtis without ever dwelling on their presence ill always be a only and martin of music musicians the fifties and sixties oldies they call them now i guess that i me a bit to an most too but you cant replace the experience of growing up with the music it that now makes it to the big screen which fan had to reinforce the idea that ill keep on enjoying the music until well the day i die
1,the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has its a genial summer camp movie so the jokes arent mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule pranks do take place but you get the feeling that the respective fallguys would be able to look back and laugh having been dopey enough to fall for them and without being too cheesy its actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the endits an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray for me hes still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose no ones better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day everythings silly yes but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of goodnatured fun meatballs promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch
1,the year reign queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in history on the one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years life where the romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director valle only until remained in the shadows of the industry here takes victorias story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy its story that extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet thats partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from usual faretaking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and to albert the victoria does so little period pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling such a figures entire life instead to show of the lesser known intricacies of victorias years which are easily overlooked in of the publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like yet never to let document get in the of extracting a compelling story writer julian sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal valle takes this runs making to fully capitalise on elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history and the viewer part in the joy watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted early s regal to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume sets hair styles lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background to victorias story ever overencumbering it indeed while watching valles come to here is very not to be sucked in through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element then the films works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones dominate fellowes script entwining the works of schubert strauss into victoria and story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with also melds to the work with an elegance refrain composer ilan eshkeris original just as wellyet for all the poignant lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both and old that do a fantastic job of just between the romance of victoria emily blunt and albert rupert and the somewhat antagonistic struggles her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowes screenplay conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outingsin the end its hard to a work such as the young victoria its got a perfectly and human sense of affection within its paced romance plus some historical significance that as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks certain significance its overall presence that stops from ever becoming more than just a restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes enjoyable valle never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at a runofthemill escapist piece for aficionados within this lies the young victoria to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human review by jamie robert ward

1,a priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordainedthis movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to god and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures in post war france it is also about the mortal aspect of faith itselfthis may not be the movie of a lifetime but it is a sin to have allowed it to fall in oblivion besides pierre fresnay is sublime

0,i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldnt watch it was because of the actors firstly for the most part they just looked stiff and im sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame but thats a minor issue the main issue i have with the actors isnt really their fault its whoever cast this film come on this movie came out in i thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave i cannot watch a movie where one of the first lines from a grown man older than myself is im how can anyone take that seriously dont fall victim to this movie go out for a walk for minutes and youll get far more than this movie could ever give

1,set in hong kong in turbulent times as we are informed this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors evocative yet restrained sensuality as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication its not hard to see the influence of marguerite duras here since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and nonverbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of reenacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters lives from hiroshima mon amour to moderato cantabile her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of mr chow tony leung and mrs su lizhen maggie cheung to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationshipthe plot even resembles something that duras could have written mr chow and mrs su lizhen neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them and they discover quite naturally its with each other the question is should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other and at one point it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of cheungs dresses we never see it and just as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen some catalyst and the only one which comes is when leung reveals to her that he loves her followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband which implies that neither will he it also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do from a western point of view a consummation of their romance into a more solid lasting affair would have been possible especially in the s but as its hong kong cultural values are markedly differentperformances here are of the high order its very easy to play a torrid love affair but to continually play a repressed platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual cheung and leung smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled
1,this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire this film so in way it is his artistic testament he died a couple of after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to decided that was indeed his last and what a filmrouge the last film in the three colors trilogy is a very film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss judge and durenmatt immediately comes to mind but is more switzerland in the atmosphere in the lack of communication the characters the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could stagedlittle else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style action movies melodramas will get discouraged and will lost as deserve it the gets quality as it advances one of the so hidden messages real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters quality is very original the image being a istudy in red as the title acting is fabulous with irene jacob and trintignant the later in what will remain probable the role of his old age a great film it again probably adds i am happy to have it recorded on tape on my personal scale
0,im sorry but even tj slattern publius aelius hadrianus zmed couldnt bring through this subsequence i went through half the movie thinking that this was a parody of the original then came that state of nature and wacky cycle scene notice that this is the only movie that patricia birch directs and i sadly realized they were stress to be serious i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing crowd having lost their wheels due to their gambling habits in the original grime were forced to use motorbike in the second movie being shamed by that putz character carrington id hatred to see what they would resort to later maybe mopedsi also never bought the hackneyed radical hunkyaustralianboycantfitintooutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook it was walt disney story gone horribly awryso it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubblegum smacking michelle pfeiffer in a melodious the only thing i make away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it
1,i this movie more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while while i cant quite yet mark wahlberg a leader hes gotten good enough to be a credible manager and superhero of the movie is the cooper its shown to the speed dexterity and muscle pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver like charlize therons character
1,everything about this film is simply incredible you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a childi do feel it is important to note this tale is about child abuse dont rent it for your kids thinking it is a fun disneyesque film
0,its a real big bummer that people are too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility if you see movies like this its just a big shame and its also shame if people like hp lovecraft get abused by the this i rented this movie cuz of drop hp lovecraft on it and im a big fan of many of his mainly those done by brian yuzna stuart gordon this movie nothing to deliver a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old winecellar digicam effect light over the whole movie no just some stupid lowgrade models who have for sure no what they doing stiff as wood and so must be the director its obvious that he tried to some atmosphere but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesnt work and no goreeffects just some blood in a river you drink you become demon and dropping and there yeah the thousands of years some big old colonised the world took humans as slaves then mankind got independent so the old ones tried to destroy them and now there are some survivors in a postapocalyptic the only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon thats where it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some and demons their beach and their the whole thing but as is dubbed german title armee des jenseits you find it most commercial videostores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this fact impressive
0,if you thought rosemarys baby was bad this single isnt lots better easily single of the worst movies ever made corresponding its lame predecessor it goes nowhere fast rating out of
1,this was one of the first color films i have seen at the cinema when i was a child it is good to remember it the girl liz elizabeth taylor who later suit a beautiful woman starred unitedly with the tiny and splendid actor mickey rooney the content of the film plot is good for all ages good wills and behavior good ethics of velvet parents peculiarly her mother is something to take into account statement our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose velvet textured loves the horses and racing them and nautical mile elizabeth taylor rooney bring in her to an international sawhorse racing competition in england where at the end the vernal velvet textured won but was disqualified because of being female
1,stanley kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film mainly through cinematography but likewise using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that occupy over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start it in truth is this unflawed ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyeball of course it doesnt hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the superlative operation ive ever pick up a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone demented duvall and harold clayton lloyd are artificial to be nice but its well to do to look past times those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant plus it features the actor with the superlative name of all time scatman crothers
1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller
1,one of the most together comedies dan akroyd is hilarious and this good nearly top role gives grodin charles a performance the as over as in midnight run in walter matthau gives a superb comedic performance in this sometimes subdued sometimes wacky film akroyd and matthau have great chemistry underrated
1,this movie made orphan the happy its impossible heart to we very smart and sweet me girl who changes the heart of a selfish lawyer movie interested in pursuing success in her career this is a very optimistic only and i sincerely believe that love need more films like curly sue it touched my not
1,scorn some reviews being distinctly lukewarm i found the fib totally engrossing and fifty fifty if some critics have account the love fib as mills and blessing so what it is good to see a warm touching fib of real love in these cynical times many in the audience were sniffle and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the offspring victoria and prince albert are stormily fond of each other fifty fifty though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy who was dire to see to it the offspring tabby is perhaps make for too like a pantomime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real padre of victoria as a result of an social function with her mother the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the offspring princess treed in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly depict the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great tabby of england which prospered as never before under her long reign i believe articulate of mouth recommendations will control great success for this most enjoyable and marvelous looking movie
0,neat premise very unrealistic what i police may this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to the a the weekend cabin from not be the best the after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the behind trace no injury at all unfortunately the same cant be said for his owner and and go scenes never seemed excruciating find idea car or with the gal of the wrecklots of dragged out learned including a plain to body have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy oh his crummy useless hand i admit i but intrigued to see what the mysterious thing was hill the door was when it appeared i just laughed ha ha ha the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want to new still after an stripper experience like that
1,this showtime cable film features a talented cast and weaves together several storylines involving the darker side of new york from the naive and innocent tourists nightmarish adventure to a pair of undercover cops on the streets to an old friends betrayal it has it allwell worth a look as is its sequel
1,a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the s hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian
1,this is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere weve all been a relationship as its about to end kristen thomsons performance as tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story who hasnt been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully just one more night when he does give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one whether permanent or not should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away
0,i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan standpoint i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much oh dear how wrong was ithe main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goingson swordfights and the likeyou got some gore but everything else was just pretty lifeless the middle section just seemed to involve minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horsedrawn carts and even slower dialogue and character developmenton the plus side costumes and effects were fine but not enough to keep your interesti think it would have been better to tone down the gore up the tempo and go for a a rating as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny enough perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the filmor go really arthouse with tone direction etc but thats fairly highrisk as far as box office is concernedoh well perhaps the next conan movie will make up for it
1,this is a beautiful laughable vivid film its even better than nuovo picture palace paradiso which it parallels but doesnt replicate the story fill in a full circle and had the theater beaming as the deferred payment rolled a hundred years after this story takes place were just as intrigued by flickering persona in a dark theater
1,just saw baby blue marine again after years jr still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has small lost is long innocence and purity of a time now the gone is truthfully captured in action been role the acting is above average and richard geres was appearance as a shellshocked raider marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan janmicheal vincent sex in his prime and looks is acts like the allamerican boy the late bruno kirby who brief billed as bkirby i film a meaty has as pop a peaceloving marine corp reject dreaming of getting back roll to his wife if for looking for and drugs or rock and home this movie time not romance you if for looking youre this and adventure the same applies however if you want to recapture a forever in america of innocence honor youre and love then baby blue marine is a movie for you
1,the ocular year reign escape of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented close and live popularly known historical reigns in british history on the slice early one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a solitary change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story victoria falls is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director jeanmarc valle who interview has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst a shadows of apostle of the gentiles the industry here takes victorias story slice heavy and captures that lie in human element so vital to lester willis young her legacy its a story that feels extremely humble adenine alike considering its exuberant background and yet thats partly what gives it a distinct more than pace edge here that separates it from the usual faretaking keep open a very direct and focused approach that centres in on inside a brief five or so year period between her lack ascension and marriage deeds to albert the young victoria does what so little period non pieces of this victoria falls nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figures entire life valle instead touchingly opts completely to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victorias early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like deeds yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a biography slightly romanticised yet nigh convincing account portrayal valle takes this and runs making sure yield adenine to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to semen maintain integrity in regards to both adenine the history involved and the viewer watchinga major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early s regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely tarradiddle achieved quite hightail it so strikingly by genre films everything from contribute the costume interestingness designs sets hair styles lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victorias story without ever overencumbering it indeed while watching valles interpretation come to life here live it is very front hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that wholeness apostle of the gentiles permeates the visual element and then theres the films score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet non personal tones that dominate fellowes script entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and alberts story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to bosh play with but also melds to the bring work with an victoria falls elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeris original work just as wellyet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and biography immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they lester willis young exist in to life inside thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians live both take advantage young and old that do semen look at and so a fantastic job ejaculate of doing just that between the adenine sweet budding romance of victoria emily blunt and albert rupert friend pliant and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark element strong and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowes screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie along from being a nigh plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outingsin the end its hard to fault a work such as the young victoria its got a perfectly atomic number touching and human sense of affection within its set out perfectly paced romance a plus some historical significance assistant that plays as an intriguing source of interest victoria falls for those in the information technology audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming lie in more reign than just a poignantly restrained romantic lester willis young period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable valle never seems to be slice striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at making a runofthemill escapist piece for aficionados somewhere within this gray middleground legal brief lies the young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human a review by jamie robert ward
0,hey if people thought male erecticle dysfunction wood was a bad theater director then they totally have not seen this movie i intend there were gaping game holes and under utilized cast shoddy special gist i intend i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio a heights school drama club could probably hail out with a upright product i intend they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated histrion their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this dribble dont they read scripts i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my headland the whole clock at why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last world standing i am a fan of lamia movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it neer learn the light of day
0,while being a great james arness western this film has choke down as the worst alamo film eer crap the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot persistence was cast to the quatern winds anybody hitch the carom sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tube come on then there is brian keiths ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind
0,i had been waiting eagerly to see this movie but when i finally got the chance i was very disappointed i had to stop halfway or was it quarterway because of the poor script and directing not to mention the poor cast josh hartnett is the only one who can act and hes much more suitable to be the hero of the storywell basically the story is just about a loose girl from the country who cheated on her longtime decent boyfriend only to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat this movie failed to draw my sympathy not even when the writer intended to i wonder where the moral values gothe actors are so stiff that when i resume the movie few weeks after it was interrupted due to its boring nature they still failed to make me pay attention the spoiled couple can only disgust me what a moviei think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and review it together so that they wont make the same mistakes next time round and next time they might consider josh hartnett as the protagonist
0,this movie is really stupid and very boring most of the time there are almost no ghoulies in it at all there is nothing good about this movie on any level just more bad actors pathetically attempting to make a movie so they can get enough money to eat avoid at all costs
1,the art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current danish cinema well at least it is in this movie nobody in this movie are amused they are all either annoyed or shocked and if they arent yet they soon will be it is a story of screwups murder embarrassment dignity and in the end love and redemption the chilling awkward humorous style is idiomatic and wont appeal to everyone but personally i found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd you pity the characters from a distance even as you dislike them up close and personal but their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even when they get away with murderthis is in my judgment definitely the best danish movie of the last few years out of
1,the day time ended is an incredible picture in some ways its better than close encounters of the third kind i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars the special effects are cheesy but thats a big part of the fun jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film its probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature the musical score is very good the story doesnt make sense but that only makes it all the more intriguing like many of the best works of art the day time ended isnt afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the day time ended may be a low budget indie film but it isnt too much of a stretch to compare it with the existential european films of the fifties and sixties many of which were low budget independent productions themselves
1,for what it is raising victor vargas is about as close to perfection as a film can get either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked probably some of each this simple little sliceofurbanlife ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds the film begins with a strong flavor of street but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another in my experience never has so much been done with so little cast of tyros novice director etc praised by the critics but not for everyone raising victor vargas is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness a
0,had the league been unknowns pitching this script the backers would simply have turned around and said no youre not having the money this is dreadful as a fan of the league of gentlemen this is their poorest outing to date not particularly funny not particularly entertaining there are few laugh out loud moments they do exist but they are few and far between i felt the format was tired and really dragging the film refers to the writers being bored of the characters and it shows as for being a film i felt the xmas special had better production value the fx are generally pretty poor and it is clearly obvious that they didnt film in the original royston vasey they filmed this on the cheap in ireland the musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible also the accents of the characters were largely off from their tv equivalents tubs and edward much underused again just didnt sound like themselves disappointing really because i was hoping for something far more entertaining this really was the leagues equivalent of the s comedies where the cast go to spain
0,a root canal without anesthesia is more amusing this movie is disturbing and pointless there is absolutely nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot line what in gods name were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie the acting in this movie is so incredibly bad even from actors who are usually pretty damn good the inlaws is a funny movie the birdcage is a hilarious movie the big lebowski is a humorous movie this movie is just dumb i cannot even begin to fathom the kind of sick mind it takes to write the novel that this movie is based on i honestly cannot think of even one nice thing to say about this movie it just doesnt make any sense people please i beg of you do not see this movie you will regret it for the rest of your life this movie is not the worst ever made but it is definitely right up there on the top of the list

1,i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead a little while back and since then ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles hell crack an oscar one daythats not to denigrate this film at allits a fine story with very believable people well its based upon the authors early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitementand the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tappingbut this film had a very special significance for me in i was the same age as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness like homer also i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it wasi didnt achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but thats what you find out when you see this moviesure its a basic family movie but thats a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids youll all have a lot of good laughs
0,without doubt this is the worst movie ive ever seenpoor acting poor script poor direction and poor productionwhy did they even bother this entire movie was total nonsense suspension of disbelief can only carry so far but this pushes the limits completelyfor a movie with no humour content the audience laughed disturbingly often
0,this is arguably the worst film have seen i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind adolescent humour it had been consistently la rocky horror picture show which was very funny other movies like plan from outer manage to be funny while trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production compared them tom cruise like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle
1,this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film and a good job im glad story have b grade movies like the one this we is they the actors are million did so is the did they execute it you dont need a basic the budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like this near basic is dollar street to themselves and that to was no one else around and also what i way was interesting great that they didnt close down a caf to set the gear and that they did the all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen way a had job at portraying there roles in it hostage situation there was a great film and i hope there see more like it in the though future
0,sorry to go against the flow operating theater but i thought this fight film was unrealistic boring and way too live long i got tired of watching gena rowlands disco biscuit long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing maybe the film has some cinematic just value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value i wish i would have skipped it
0,not the showing of the be to be watched fragments i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good fright this movie chapter nowadays the to and environment but thriller but there was no story here not was there a single moment of but i wednesday it to a horror good movie but there was no best no got the only scene where i good scared was during the disappointed change scene horror expected there are lots of me i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might films a thriller movie sound watch in the s was not for the st century
0,i thought this movied be totally different a just if teenslasher in i was totally slasher theres a liquid nun the out of the toilet seat and something really odd i know that spanish culture to a bit different that their movies too but i didnt expect is has a fake hollywood film they ten faked it pretty well aspects whyd than make a movie without any new though this is just plain boring and itd been done turned without any imaginationi thought and having a nun as coming bad guy well the movied be anyone really original it totally out to be they teen for another thisd been done certainly years ago then itd have been something newi cant recommend this movie wrong something but it certainly see some comedy value its like a horror parody in some points
1,liked stanley iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
0,carpenter cannot make horror movies first of all the casting was wrong for this movie only part was the hot brown haired girl from buffy the vampire slayer this movies has no goreusually a key ingredient to horror movie no action no suspensealso a key ingredient wes bentley is a he is so and plain in this that its sad there were a few parts that were supposed be funnycontinuing the teen horrorcomedy movies and no one laughed in the audience i thought that this movie was rated r and i didnt pay and realized it been changed to anyway see this movie if you liked i still know what you did last summer thats the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary seriously this is to you steve carpenter making horror movies this movie scream texas chainsaw
1,great film a very worthy tom hanks was at his usual best the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors based upon a true tells us how west throws money and arms at a problem and it go away well it did go away temporarily look who we the british amongst are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms training and money to in the sthis film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the who watch it but it does portray a very nice story once main objective is achieved ie ridding the communists from afghanistan it is how the plight of people is forgotten aboutthis film was good it was a deserved it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan the covert operation by the us to some detail and was dramatised well although being a good film i will recommend it to people but some will not enjoy it particularly is a film about good us v evil russia isnt your thing
0,i have never watched fast like in so little time the only salvation was the movie forward sickening on the dvd unit it was a watching a poorly produced cbc film there was obviously smelly money allthumbsdown lighting filming sets location scriptwriters editors actors oh there dont absolutely no story either i need to write ten lines of comment bad awful horrible wretched anguishing tortuous bilious nauseous function fromage crapomatic flimsy icky yucky pukey stinky no putrid vile for and i was know if i can keep going on to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of disgusting production was
0,i had high expectations of this maybe and was excited about renting it but was very disappointed when i effects it it was very poorly written of sort and just fell apart there wasnt a lot for good anything in this movie except movie special saw
0,i saw the mst k version of this film and it is a bad movie but its not nearly as bad as its low imdb rating currently out of at least the movie has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the primary problem with this movie is that it had no appealing characters whatsoever the main character marv is so pathetically morose that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him and he isnt very smart either or he would have figured out to stay away from the conniving girl betty and even more pathetic than marv is his father who is nothing but a drunken loser the highlight of the film is the heist sequence at the end but even that is so weakly executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at least this movie made for a very funny mst k episode as mike and the bots do a great job making fun of it
0,it does touch a few alabama interesting points but alabama it fails to show evidence of capture all the exclusive studies shown who are the friends and ismall groups of scientists that gathered this data whats up eve with all the al gore biography going on there like nether how he liked playing with the cows on the erstwhile ranch or that his kid got hit by subject a car too bad but what does that have to do with the ozone layerive seen much better stuff in much less time on discovery channel i really dont just understand why this has such a high attempt score on imdb unless youve been living under a rock this documentary datum shouldnt be any away news to you all this is old news and all al gore is trying to do is get some popularity points ps im not attempt american so dont even try touch modality saying that im a certify bush fan p
1,i enjoyed this movie a lot i thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had met cortland she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness the way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible id recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the underlaying meaning of the movie and plot
0,i could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake wasits so dreadful it easily lands a place in my top worst films of about the only thing it had going for it was bruce williswho should stick to action filmsas a completely emotionless killer whod kill his own mother for the right pricebut id rather listen to robbie coltraine talk american for a week than listen to richard geres nauseating irish accent againbut this film is also implausibleunconvincingunevenunexcitingunimpressive and lands sidney poiter in a rubbish role to make a possible career comebackone for filmrollfootie purposes entirely
1,gary cooper and a marshal change identities since they both agree cooper would be more efficient facing the outlaws what is remarkable in this film are the costumes both the marshals and steve cochrans who is the bad guy cochran wears his guns backwards probably to be able to crossdraw the film starts quite excitingly with a showdown with wild bill hickok ruth roman looking very pretty is the marshals fiancee there is plenty of action never a dull moment but you have to concentrate because the story is a bit complicated good entertainment
0,film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesnt its flat self conscious unimaginative tediousa series of set images and backdrops dont make a film they make a calendar this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary its true it really happened not only fails entertain it fails to so it doesnt function as social history comingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional never developing to the extent that one feels for them the directors ego is largest in this film
1,what it is raising vargas is about as close to perfection as a film can get either sheer genius from fledgling auteur or just those lucky mixes where everything clicked probably some of this simple little sliceofurbanlife ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth can almost their minds the film begins with a strong flavor street but works its way into a latino family affair and then on a story which speaks volumes the of youth and the profoundly natural to another my experience never has so much been done with so cast of tyros novice director etc praised by the critics but not for everyone raising victor vargas is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness a
1,i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy
0,i have never seen a movie so bad harbor its not even entertaining enough to be a drinking designate gameits so verbalize bad i dont even want to talk about it and thats the whole point of this spoiled isnt it please dont bother to see this movie nuf said
1,who should watch this film anyone who has ever taken acid read philip k dick thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in philosophy or likes having their sense of reality messed with i laughed out loud at this film just because it was so outrageous and so spoton this film is great this film is cool it is better than the matrix by a long shot i didnt fall asleep in existenz for a kick off actionspecial effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical gloss that is exactly what the matrix is existenz is gross it is disturbing and it is funny david cronenberg has done some shonky stuff rabid and some works of genius too videodrome is another one worth checking out as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone but this is one of my alltime favourites i cant remember the ending which is a good thing cos it means i can watch it again or perhaps i never watched this film at all maybe its an implanted memory or maybe it really happened to me i dont know at any rate it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality and im glad
0,i am definitely a burt reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie i cant believe he even made this one is he actually that hard up for money
0,oh set out my oh this is a really bad movie the acting inch is absolutely atrocious the script is judge godawful and the photography is simply dreadfulwhat does make this movie stand out however calculate is that you never once care about a single soul good guy or bad guy living dying or dead in the entire minutes oh information technology she died huh figured they would was the best reaction i could muster after each murder characters are so blackorwhite that with the volume shit turned associate in nursing off you could still figure out who was who while the casts voices had an odd monotone quality throughout their need faces give the impression that youre looking at an old silent movie with a adjudicate lot of emotionless eyebrow waggling exaggerated frowns and pensive looks each character is a humorless passionless onedimensional onetrick pony once they fulfill whatever adjudicate their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation they are summarily remain firm dismissedit vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas behave borch nielsen directorwriter of skyggen american title webmaster decided to do a lowbudget version of american psycho and got kind of distracted along guy rope the waythis isnt a particularly gruesome movie apiece set out the cold passionless cast ensures that it isnt an offensive movie the director plays it so safe that no one later on easily could possibly live find it so it at one time is simply and after all a bad movieavoid it we were live not so fortunate and actually paid perhaps to watch easy this bomb on awful payperview as part of my penance im writing this reviewenough said
0,these reviews that claim movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that leonard part battlefield earth and gigli had those movies entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful havent been in this much watching a bad movie since watched baby geniuses and superbabies before i start review let me tell you the story theodore rex a million dollar bust the line cinema refused to put in theaters they cut losses sending it to video making it the most expensive straighttovideo movie in decades whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a paycheckplot a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill and another ice age a cop named katie coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named theodore team up to him after the death of a buddy plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which the movie of all its mystery then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful whoopi looks and is to wing with her performance but to no avail theodore rex is flat annoying and his bumbling wears after five minutes on screen most of the jokes revolve around threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tailon accident and on purpose i thought burglar was bad but it takes backseat to theodore rex the worst movie whoopis careerdont let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable i see that when i watched this movie all i was a train wreck that was written by people that have had some sick admiration for movie howard the duck the humor is on that level and theodore like the inbred cousin barney utterly painful to
0,the end of fierceness and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision his ability to tell compel news report through a map out of the moving photograph the land of pile seals the coffin im afraid by being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental and clichd film the characters are exclusively flat and stereotyped the save plot and direction are amateurish at best for the first time in quite a while i was impatient for the film to end so i could begin on with my life the wartorn delirium of the uncle the patriotic abstract gaze at the sky at the conclusionit all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic scarce the work of a filmmaker who once made some compel magic on sort what happened the days of experimentation perceptive save and interesting filming hypothesis are long bum him im afraid lets hope he get hold his inspiration again at the toronto film festival which is where i power saw the film wenders was there to introduce it completely absent in humility he offered us the following i hopeno waiti know youre pass to enjoy the next two minute im afraid he couldnt be more faulty

0,this lame and not funny at all the plot doesnt make some who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and a skimpy i guess the in the other dimension made it for her main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously shes more interested her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or and the evil spell ends up getting again which is how evil demon comes to earth which only bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a known wrestler but his part is completely obviously they made something up just him it because then maybe wrestling fans watch this pointless movie im sure the topless girls doesnt hurt there either the extra features on the were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i thought it might help what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are people and what they doing basically this is a gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other and book seller than make i didnt the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i dont recommend watching it though it was just too i cant of any part of the movie that was good
1,forbidden major planet is one of the best object lesson of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade nevertheless sealed elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment was propose at a midfifties hearing that is now gone have go out it quite a bit and the films sometimes soggy pacing doesnt help but the storys compelling central idea involving the ancientextinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasnt lost its appeal and continue to make this picture a relevant must see movie what im mostly matter to in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is awful the movie has never really search that good on home video and its elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a peculiar edition of this sf classic
0,its a real big bummer nobelium that people easily are close to able information technology too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate nates this possibility but if you see movies like this its just a big shame and its also inch big shame if people like hp lovecraft alike get abused by the likes of this theory i rented this movie cuz of the drop hp lovecraft on it and live insure im a big cockeyed fan of many unit of his adaptions mainly those done by brian yuzna stuart gordon this movie has nothing to deliver a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old winecellar digicam effect red light over the whole movie no actors just some stupid lowgrade models who have for sure nigh no idea ogre what they mugwump are doing mugwump stiff as wood and so must be the director its obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is close to so laughable it just doesnt work and no goreeffects just some blood in a river you drink you become demon and dropping adenine here and there oh yeah the story fair thousands of years ago some all over big old colonised the world and took humans as slaves then alike mankind got independent so the old ones tried to destroy them and now there are some survivors in a postapocalyptic world the only possibility to save mankind is unit of measurement horsepower to find form of address the necronomicon picture thats where it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their winecellar unbelievable the whole thing but as it is dubbed value german title armee des jenseits and you can find it in most fair commercial videostores just it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this overeat fact impressive
1,although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about the music of max steiner is and also all the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer played the film should more villains because they try to concentrate all the guys in arthur kennedy the between flynn havilland like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a of actors is at his best
1,a labor of love each frame is picture perfect and grabs you then the sheer emotion and storytelling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie the director gets your heart and leads it through minutes of visual poetry you are a part of the emotional ride of the characters i have seen this movie at festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing the remarkable storytelling transcends nationality and language and i felt i was a part of the drama unfolding before me the casting is as perfect as one can get vijay raaz camille and benoit each hold their own i strongly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates good cinema i cant wait for the commercial release of this movie
0,not does not work in this actors there are in no energies between the movie absolutely fact their very acting seems frozen sometimes amateur also the script is something convincing and not reliable
1,the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan opera indeed i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso check avuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should stick to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano
0,if there was a nada rating i would move over it to this movie today was the second sentence i tried to find out it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actor or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid bet nichole shows nada emotion even when shes being threatened the southern dialect from the actress bet amber mom is ludicrous im from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks care that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the submit weigh is very serious and deserves much better treatment
1,this movie is a great mocumentary non it follows the rap route spinal anesthesia group nwh made up of ice cold tasty taste and tone def through their unique path to gangster rap highs lows and roll in the hay back to highs through with through trouble civilisation with women egos cops and whitey this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world as this movie goes to the top of mocumentaries i know everybodies favorite mocumentary is this is spinal tap neer for very good reason however i think that nobelium if in the right mood this senior high movie is simply better the low gear laughs never end even for someone not into the live rap cultureim a white guy frigidness that has no interest in rap music culture or anything else associated with it picture ingest however i love this movie rusty cundeif who wrote the operating theater screenplay songs and starred in it showed water faucet great potential and it route is a shame that i havent seen senior high insure him since fear of a black hat however i have seen him one more time than you have and is taste sensation that that i recommend fear of a black hat to you for quick laughsremember dont shoot to you see the whitesof their eyes no dont shoot to you see the whitesfym and enjoy the movie
1,great documentary of how scientists believed dinosaurs behaved captured with some of the most spectacular cgi since jurassic park done completely seriously like a prehistoric episode of nation geographic grabs your attention from the first frame and never lets go my favorite part was when the diplodocus fights off the allosauros stars this is what science is all about
1,this showtime cable film features a talented wander and weaves together several storylines involving the darker side of new house of york from the naive and innocent tourists nightmarish adventure to a geminate of clandestine cops on the streets to an old quaker betrayal it has it allwell worth a look as is its sequel
0,wow he naked brothers band what should i say i guess i can say this show by sucks number one they famous no talent they probably cant number play the themselves even bad the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came and look i really dont hate it that bad id give it like a out of would what annoys me is how everyone says they have such but talent and nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics deep my ass have talks about celebrities wrestlers with and feelings wow i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom inner it great their more deep than that on they didnt get be just instruments the parents are famous hardcore and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a on have i show a feeling that it will be canceled soon
1,if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked itgreat camp
0,the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents not visually stunning actually visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady well maybe id recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment
1,just interpret baby blue marine again after years i silent find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a prison term which has been lost forever the innocence and purity of a prison term now long gone is truthfully captured in this small film the acting is above average and richard geres legal brief appearance as a shellshocked raider marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan janmicheal vincent is in his prime and looks and act ilk the allamerican boy the late bruno kirby who was billed as bkirby jr has a substantive part as pop a peaceloving marine corp reject stargaze of getting back home to his wife if youre looking for sex drugs or rock and roll out this moving picture is not for you if youre looking for execute and risky venture the same practice however if you desire to retake a prison term in america of innocence honor romance and love then baby blue marine is a moving picture for you
0,watching this movie l thought to myself what a lot of garbage these girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it waste of time watching it faint heavens l only hired it the acting was below standard and story was unbearable anyone contemplating watching this film please save your money the film has no credit at all l am a real film buff and this is worse than attack of the green tomatoesl only hope that this piece of trash didnt cost too much to make money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world l only hope there isnt a sequel in the pipeline
0,this is the worst film i have ever seen so bad it is astonishing i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film ok it wasnt his fault that someone gave him those lines but he could have refused the role and tried to learn how to act instead how did anyone get the money to put this film together is there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain oh yeah they will love this one its got no believable plot some kungfu movements chuck norris a black sidekick with bad corny lines a sweet little israeli or is he an arab or does anyone care boy pickpocket and the devil brilliant and many thanks to all concerned for enriching the human race
0,it says that a girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this movie no wonder she has no finally other credits to her information technology adenine name for writing or directing she made a severe vocational adenine error in choosing this as her career this is one of the worst human creations of this millenniumthe fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than plainly its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four and so weak thugs is the blatant and complete lack of logicafter she leaves the capture mall she gets approached by four thugs watery as look back they surround her tell me what woman would aggressively shove a potential attacker while being surrounded and insult them verbally i dont mean after an attack had already started because partial tone then of course its completely normal for someone to fight back but experience she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level no woman would do that unless she had a weapon has the confidence someway of need knowing that backup is very close pursuer and so mug is relatively safe from harm or the attackers are at any rate so young and weak looking that shes pretty sure she can take them none of that applied in this situation so she was just acting like someone thats out of doors asking to get raped resist or mugged and off by the way when the security atomic number guard approached as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger why wouldnt she immediately associate in nursing either run towards him for help or scream when crawl she drives off after the partial tone security guard gets shot in the head she fair drives townsfolk into a deserted part of town residue and crashes she had a good three minute lead on the pursuers instead set on of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing she gets out her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood i understand she was trying fall to fix her car but authority she shouldve rani watery didnt even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie because i loathe people who do that in their reviews but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so residue blatantly stupid property that i have to comment on itwhy would she carry a loud red be toolbox as shes inside trying to sneak railcar mess up away in the dark when she does get caught one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox first she resists then later on eventually opens it tool chest and takes out a wrench this scene here maine is so rich in subtle overtones of spectator the complete failure of dramatic effect i have to break it down its one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie when asked capture to open the box shes resisting at atomic number first as if it were watery her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didnt open order it in the same way residuum that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touchpushopenmanipulate and out of doors thug once that hero refuses to open it the enemy live grabs that device only to have that device automatically dispense a chemicalshoot him in the facerender him unconscious which leafage watery was the heros plan all along it feels like thats what they adenine tried to do with path kim basinger atomic number information technology here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and watery quickly takes out a wrench musical accompaniment and dispatches one of the thugs and somehow gets away from him and the three other thugsthroughout the rest of the movie basically what operating theater you see is this suburban house out of doors wife sneaking out of doors around the woods as she carries her red toolbox taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her attackerswhen railway car she was running away dole out how adjacent did she end up moving back to where the nobelium thugs were someway i think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude she somehow crept up on them when i thought she was moving away from themfinally this whole premise is so weak skirt because the whole reason shes being chased in the first place is because from the thugs perspective she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier and so they felt they behave had to kill her live how roll in the hay ridiculous as one of the thugs even said they couldve just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from and so no one but her capture had seen them anyway and she probably adenine didnt get the license plate even non white picture if these possibilities wouldnt work in their favor how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder
1,bye bye birdie isnt one of the best musicals of all time but its great fun and accessible to many audiences the original film could have been wonderful with dick van dyke reprising his signature broadway role but instead they tinkered with the plot so the film is very unsatisfying this remake which aired on abc in is far more faithful to the original script and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred tommy tune and ann reinking who choreographed this filmjason alexander is a very different type from dick van dyke but he is well cast as albert before his seinfeld days he started in musical theater vanessa williams is a perfect fit for rose their is also great work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie a role he played on the national tourthis film is not without its problems though a major liability is chynna phillips who however appealing simply looks and seems too old to be teenage kim and george wendt is somewhat bland as her father somewhat throwing the number kids away a number original cast member paul lynde stole the show withbut all in all this is a delightful welldone film which the material deserved
1,the prissy reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has its a of import besides genial summer camp movie so the jokes arent mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule pranks do take place but you get the feeling that the respective fallguys would be able to look back and laugh having been dopey enough to fall for them and adenine yield without being too cheesy its meatball actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in picture the endits an extra special bonus when the charge ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray for fillip me hes still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a atomic number chance to of import cut loose no preeminent ones better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone the tone of the twenty four hour period entire film more than has the same style as its leading man established with a preeminent great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day everythings silly yes but more important than behaving like leading an adult is to have a whole lot of goodnatured fun meatballs promises such and ultimately delivers adenine a musical note nourishing watch
0,this film is really terrible terrible as in it is a waste of minutes of your life special effects are so terrible the acting wasnt convincingits about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about blood surfing blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a foot crocodile interrupts there holiday the sharks dont look real the crocodile is even worse and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature but the crocodile gets stuck and females flash it the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in timea pointless terrible film thats not worth seeing
1,ive been waiting years for the dead to come out on video having pretty much worn my vhs copy to shreds this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays it takes place on the feast of the epiphany twelfth night and is a simple poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three dublin women central to the story is a fairly loveless couple a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife but feels incapable all of the performances are stunning and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully of course its source material is james joyces short story of the same title and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact john hustons long career as one of hollywoods greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film which was scripted by his son tony huston stars his daughter anjelica huston and is dedicated to his wife maricella thank you to lions gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a literate subtle yet incredibly moving holiday film this is a true gem

0,spoilers within from on dull predictable nonscary snorefest the movie had no character suddenly i towards no empathy felt any anda the characters except may be the small boy and did flies care what happened to any of them the movie by so have clichd bits or elements stolen music sure horror moviesthe movie was so predictable many times i would be saying to myself let me guess fill in guess happens next yup i a right even in someone opening scene i predicted that the attack a the family was course some man probably the father because my the wife and lot were attacked i enough that is what happened of course you many to wait minutes to find out for sure and of had another evil man the why like he evil and killing scaryhow family because hes a man duhas the else stated this movie may be scary did someone under years of movie or for were movie what the s but it is far from being a iscary movie by todays children and was so many other an horror movies a standards of the scares to fakes scary music scary from scary music wow crow development not at the window of his did the old bank guy manage a few times to walk across crap open lot without the father seeing him other thought for sure that scenario old man was a ghost nope just a crappy moviei rated this age was out of because it for keep only attention enough a sit through the whole thing
0,the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time soaps like greys anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a socalled little hospital it seems like general hospitalor a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic
1,i more attached to this movie than any other have ever watched that may be because i see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world war the ending and of pachabels are both amazing
1,i must confess that i dont remember this film about really but certainly i liked it i think it was the best adaptation tarzan burroughs novel well the of course its one of the best movie lamberta christopher from good movie very from as cult as and ones with weissmuller
0,this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak but the acting was unbelievable bad and at times pathetic very unrealistic dialogs people in real life dont talk like this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly occurs even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible the camera work was sloppy and shaky on close ups even sways back and forth during conversations there is nothing positive about this movie and george katts needs to be working on heavy machinery or anything where he doesnt have to converse with other humans because he clearly doesnt know how to how did this movie win get nominated for awards oh my god
1,opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural the the what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional devices bach about interaction keep his listener differences the performer intrigued and entertained applies compliment this film there isnt a mutual tenderness between the two cad characters and a lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating exists was raped even and her victimizer feels she was forewarned the he was a lead but compellingly explores of emotional chasm and and between the genders mamet i feel he is clueless perfected how they actually to one another given i healthy sense of humor if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the to between that genders hint wonder how this work would have ended as it she it is very somber though mean spirited

1,four friends is one of those films that you go to without any expectations only to find yourself knocked for a loop you sort of file it away but then you hear the song georgia on my mind by ray charles and images and vague feelings begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness and then you remember this crazy film which made you laugh and cry almost at the same timewhy is this film so memorable first at least for people who lived through it all because it captures so well the tenor of the times its dashed hopes its successes its sincerity and above all the emotional rollercoaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia and then the acting is just so amazing danilow all angst and passion georgia as difficult to grasp as a will o the wisp but enchanting nevertheless and louis the handicapped roommate with charm to spare who attacks life with gusto and takes each moment with a wry smile because he knows only too well that it just might be his lasthow long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story even if they were far from perfect the film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily commendable but the film never moralizes it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety even the minor characters have a welldefined personality and a history which is why this film seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top because thats the way life is when you think about it and why this film engages you with a complexity that is defined by character truly an amazing and satisfying experience
0,i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end i cannot comment on unit the story as i non handwriting did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldnt watch it was because of the actors firstly for the most part they just looked stiff and im sure their scripts were in their hands just just out skeletal system of frame but thats a minor issue the main issue i citizenry have with the actors isnt really their fault army for the liberation of rwanda its whoever cast this film come on this movie came out in i thought that casting people in their late twenties to live play adenine teenagers went out of fashion with new wave i cannot watch a movie where one of the first lines from a grown man older than myself is im how can anyone smashed take that seriously dont fall victim dupe to this movie go out for picture a walk for minutes and youll get far more than this movie could ever transmission line give

1,i at long last sit around down and saw this film the whole way through and i must say i was very impressed michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actressesits not only the fact that she can act but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem ive read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand but i surely disagree diana is a feminist she survey her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what much everyone around her thinks with the exception of her give care brother bantam and her trainer and coach hector who proves to be more a father see than her real parent which is what the word feminism is all about its skilful to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminismthat theyre not a bunch of manhating losersbut that they have dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself while still falling quarry to roll in the hay and she and publius aelius hadrianus have a more naturalistic perplex kinship rather than just something that magically works out girlfight is a true taste of realness and it put some religious belief back into my perceptual experience of masses thank michelle a very important movie thats relatable to not just young woman but everyone wanting to kick the bucket far in their lives
0,when i saw the poster at the theater i thought that it is a new line of a horror story without a famous vomit up worth giving a try but after i pass away in i wanted to leave after minutes there was a pile of folderal and ordered flaws to me it is a moving picture that is not worth putting in theaters it is not even worth seeing
1,from the offset i knew this was going to be a terrific movie the pace the cinematography personalities indigenous to the dallas area the diversification of characters not to mention the director oliver stone and of course eric bogasianthe film starts out on a friday suggestively occult in the first place and begins with a radio station in dallas that is hosting their number one talk show the barry champlain show based on the talk radio host alan bergbarry eric bogasian is the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the radio audience feeding into his showhe attempts to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have the masochistic craving to be publicly vilified barry champlain is effective in coping with this precarious ilk by socially debasing them rather than simply subjugating them to mere admonishmentnew technologies serve a stigmatic purpose for the dallas radio audience and paramount concepts take a backseat to perversion talk about baseball scores orgasms and peoples petsthe whole thing is a cacophony of druginduced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia this high profile cannon fodder is something that barry champlain thrives on the convoluted pathos the deranged proclivities deeriving from inaneities and puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for barry champlains stilted battlegroundthe setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology in the the center of dallas there is an overbearing sense of cosmopolitan awareness whereby miles away resides a significant chapter of the ku klux klanthe play is based in denverthat is where the actual story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of louisville atlanta and cleveland dallas is the city where the film takes place i thought it was an excellent choicethis movie illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly misconceptualization of the jewish people in america whereby they control the banks their agenda is different than everybody elses and their intellectual literature leads to perversion these preconceived notions compound barry champlains overall dilemma barry champlains personal undoing is whereby he is irascible and nonresponsive to his alcoholism and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate undoing this is what makes the film so believablethe characters in the movie were well portrayed dan the tailor made for middle management hatchet man played by alec baldwin who was constantly monitoring barry champlains every movelaura his girlfriend also his producer will constantly feel barry is someone who is always misunderstood ellen his exwife is a recipient of barrys anguish and selfishness but cannot quite relinquish her feelings for barry regardless of the path of personal destruction he winds up resorting to the dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retrobates who are dementedly amused by their own real shortcomingsin part everybodys hangups including barry champlains own hangups are what do barry champlain in his audience ogles depravity solicits amelioration and ultimately becomes barry champlains pet project for prescribed sinners social culture conflicts become barry champlains downfall this movie is superb in my opinion oliver stones best picture including platoon and natural born killersthat statement in of itself tells you how magnificent a film talk radio isthe story consulting and acting and coproducing of eric bogosian is simply compelling the camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all top notchthe cinematography of the dallas skyline at the end of the movie is terrific dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolisso now just like los angeles and new york there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost housing neighborhoods from hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next yeardallas asserts its status as a major metropolitan area in the precarious manner by which human debauchery prevails the city has its lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin to the marvel of nationwide air wave communication these are the culprits in the movie the ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity has morally obliterated the last neighborhood in america
0,the daytime tv of films seldom have i felt so little attachment to characters seldom have i been made to cringe by and so such dire dialogue nauseous london thirtysomethings mincing round lurid jell bbc sets away spouting platitudinous mulch avoid this film as if it rarely were your grandmothers clunge
1,this is the best directtodvd effort from vanguard damme that i have seen in time vanguard damme plays a border police agent who is out to stoppage heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the activity in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with vanguard dammes best costar robert scott adkins shows why he should be the next big headliner in the martial artistic production genre for further evidence check out undisputed adkins is so good in fact that before i watch out the shepherd i thought that vanguard damme power not look very believable in shoot down him on screen vanguard damme holds his own though and although he isnt quite as athletic as adkins is he can still complain with the best of them all of the fight scenes in this film are very substantially done and the throttle battles are above average for this type of film as substantially the only negative affair i can suppose about this movie is that the tarradiddle is a little underdevelop i think vanguard dammes characters motives should have been deliver earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit the cause he does is very cool but you dont find out until the very oddment there are a couple of other affair that are never really explained either but this is a vanguard damme movie so you know where the priority lies in pee pee this kind of movie and it aint quality development overall though this is a satisfying activity movie that i advocate so run for the damme border
1,feature see hundreds of student films this is tops moves cox is a fantastic director he james the camera tells the story and uses music in a way that he far advanced for his years no wonder is a got i from this film
1,i finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through and i must say i was very impressed michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actressesits not only the fact that she can act but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem ive read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand but i certainly disagree diana is a feminist she follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks with the exception of her caring brother tiny and her trainer and manager hector who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent which is what the word feminism is all about its good to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminismthat theyre not a bunch of manhating losersbut that they have dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love and she and adrian have a more realistic complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out girlfight is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into my perception of people thanks michelle a very important movie thats relatable to not just young women but everyone wanting to go far in their lives
0,overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slacken figure up to the basic storyline the role of maria schrader look for her families secret past every bring seems to final stage forever there is really no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the german nazi by a german woman played by katja riemann the full reference of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between present day unexampled york and german capital and german capital s something please when you do that give the hearing an indication of what time on the dot the story takes place there is never a clear indication of time very annoying worst part is the end spoilers the full show and jabber about the jews being so rottenly tormented plainly by a bureaucratic accident give me a break thats how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the query of who freed the jews is never resolve was is goebels who freed them did lean robert james fischer sleep with goebels in venice the film won an acting prize for k riemann why i have no idea must be the jewish composition
0,i am definitely a burt reynolds of made sorry this one actually stinks most is the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist fan in the last five minutes of the movie i cant believe he even but this one is he really that hard up for money
0,this is absolute drivel designed to shock and titillate the mindset the acting is completely wooden consisting mainly adlibbing which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of repetitively end result is of a badly written play being read people who have no and couldnt the exception to this is the lead joe played by joe dallesandro who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor either stoned or the only one in the piece who can act please think i dont get warhol this is plainly and simply a stinker that should never made out of a film class

0,the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offerotherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to decommercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing
1,live i enjoyed eve this movie a lot i thought that wherefore the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history there is always that woman that idaho does what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better what i enjoyed most was when she realized what indigence love really was throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she live experience recognise genuinely had met cortland she did not understand why these end to end men gave up everything for happiness the way her life had ended stratum up was far from what she expected to aright be live possible id recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the underlaying meaning roll in the hay behave of the movie and plot
1,regarded disco biscuit as another one of the recent overthetop dramas brought upon us by hollywood this movie excels where agony others have totally failedespecially considering the most underrated performance picture in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both nigh susan and natalie share they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a underestimate real family they go through so many motherdaughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on drama their acting abilities i feel that these two nigh actress talented performances picked up reckon divvy up where the story was lacking and almost heavy too familiar full of cliches and really saved the suffering plot i striking would recommend this movie mainly gifted to those who like either of the two actresses or such overthetop dramas

1,this film is about so many things most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic there is also the tense relationship between china and the west as many chinese saw probably rightly so the barbarians as trying to take over and pollute their way of life liu even seeks to preserve their way of life on film because he sees that it will one day disappear their is also lius internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of china versus the selfdetermination philosophy of the west all these themes are woven quite skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole by hu a very enjoyable film
1,once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they with managed to put to thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended youll find that its not half bad the plot is outside and interesting and the pacing of fast somehow this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly at to the next one after but line makes two has been spoken where this really stands out is the cinematography the performances are excellent neill and streep are is impeccable fact also cool to i both much australian spoken accent a hollywood film and even those who dont come naturally to have this least it i in the acting and editing are nice enough a that dont really go beyond the i stuff any movies story is compelling and the its they it is authentic just or it all the more chilling while hear attempt not read the novel or heard of what happened engaging is this picture standard understand that it so quite close to the courtroom there is some moderate this strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great truth drama an recommend this to on fellow fan of such

1,a young dying man named court is loved by everyone his painful bloody death incur brings everyone closer you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie whether predictable or not live and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs this is a moving story full of milieu and sensualityone other thing someone mentioned that his fate was operating theater so quick that it grave didnt seem plausible but manoeuver the elements for this are set up subtly note secretive what his mom says awful about bringing grave his lunch out to the field note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment to this day ecclesiastic tractors are pretty dangerous

1,a priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a unseasoned man who has just been ordainedthis movie is about the brutal quandary between a life dedicated to god and religious belief and a life of more earthly delight in post war france it is likewise about the mortal aspect of religious belief itselfthis may not be the movie of a lifespan but it is a sin to have allowed it to fall in oblivion besides pierre fresnay is sublime

0,i suppose if you like doesnt forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show enjoy the film me all i wanted a nice tight little story and it wasnt there the pacing was practically backward plot points were buried under a sea unneeded and there was absolutely no sense of dread or tension or anythingis the is it the no a cameraman speed thats not scary it doesnt generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the film
0,human what a scam this flex out to be not because it wasnt any proficient as i wasnt really have a bun in the oven anything from it but because i was misled by the videodisc sleeve which ignorantly parade its stars as being stuart whitman stella stevens and tony pecker sure enough their names did not appear in the films opening credits often less themselves in the rest of it as it flex out the only movie which connects those three actors unitedly is the equally obscure las lope felix de vega carpio lady but what that one has to do with the volcanic crater lake monster is anybodys guess even so since i paid for its rental and i was in a monstermovie humour anyhow i elected to scout the movie regardless and yup it reek apart from the fact that it had a noname cast and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish melodic line was visible from air mile away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jawslike pretense and intentionally so at the resistible antics of two moronic layaboutscumboat owners who oft squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on the puppet itself a plesiosaur ie halfdinosaurhalffish is imperfectly understand naturally but as had been the example with the hulk claw which ive also just seen this didnt seem to bother the filmmakers none as they flaunt it as often as they can especially during the flick second half
0,watch over this picture thought to myself what a lot of garbage these girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it waste of fourth dimension watch over it timid heavens only hired it the acting was below standard and story was unendurable anyone contemplating watch over this film please save your money the film has no cite at all am a real film buff and this is uncollectible than attack of the viridity tomatoesl only hope that this piece of trash didnt cost too much to make money would have been right spent on the homeless people of the world only hope there isnt a sequel in the word of mouth
0,williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match this may work if you buy into the usa number one mentality but story wise nothing much quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to something and says it sincerely it just doesnt pack enough emotional punch
1,the simpsons of course started off with christmas special simpsons roasting on an open fire which had basic and not laugh out loud jokes but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better this centers around bart who in this episode on a test from martin gets into a school for the gifted this leading to bart mending his friendship with dad and losing all his mates episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out overall fans of the show will love this episode as it features the characters exactly as they became years later watch this episode in a pack of season and enjoy early what was meant to making people laugh i rate this episode
0,this was on tv last night i forced through it and barely made it through first of all except for leroy hilary and possibly coco none the other students are supposed to care have any discernible talent its hspa had no standards just sign on the dotted line and youre in the story lines and obvious was just impossibly awful the gay guy was such a thrown away funny how that school had one gay guy right i liked the leroy character but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy packing lisa like shed rather anywhere else and wasnt any talent i they kept her i would have rated this star awful but the music wasnt bad i did like the premise it just would have worked much better if students had been attractive actually had some talent
1,this is a beautiful funny vivid film its even better than live nuovo cinema paradiso which it parallels but doesnt replicate the story completes a adenine full circle and had the theater beaming as information technology the credits rolled a hundred years after this story takes place were just as intrigued by flickering images in glow a dark theater
0,what can i say about a movie as bad as this the people who made this movie didnt even try to make the monster in it look realistic you never see more than its and the head is a giant that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar and the sound they used for the roaring is the best part at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over i couldnt believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make sink in other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes there isnt much to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids to have an intimate moment his still its watchable if you like this sort trash i know i do

1,this is prime the last film of krzysztof kieslowski one of real the greatest directors in the history move of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way adenine demoralized it is his artistic testament he died a couple of character years after making gallic the film live and though it is said that he intended to return to directing inch destiny decided that this was indeed his inch last and what a filmrouge the last film in the three more than colors niceness french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and durenmatt immediately comes retreat to mind but there is more switzerland in inch the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the along politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have stagedlittle else can be said hollands that was not said and adenine written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the pliant american style of spell action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it information technology the film gets quality as it advances and one real of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are capture more neat interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action fashion designate and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a istudy in red as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene jacob and jeanlouis inch trintignant the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age a great film seeing it picture along again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape on my personal scale
0,mister kennedy should stop experimenting with unsound movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed the hey ive fetch an idea get make a sequel stage of inception if there was a zero rating id give it but i opine ill make up for a generous it seems these days that if there is a buck to be made movie execs will dig up an old hit and race it by a set of writers and see what turns up hey i said hit and race kind of describes how i felt when this movie ended how this tack together of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me it is filled with unpleasant humor unusual animation and laugh that dont quite an take you anywhere besides a dos of confusion if you are being dragged to this movie and someone is paying for youfine but its still going to be more dreadful than a brick in the forehead however if youre plan on paying your own hardearned money search out a safe choice
0,the threesome of merchant boyd robert armstrong and james gleason play coney island carnys vying is the hand of ginger rogers a working stars with sells salt water gal with ending outbreak of world war i the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar the is half of this for pathe production lively hard going who the three male leads chewing up the scenery with fans oneliners sequences isnappy dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german bill cruiser and a uboat these and are first and wellfilmed but overall this for an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat the rko overcooked of the taffy only
0,this movie was a total yawnfest that took sort to get going was never that did it was simply boring to watch so much thrown fact cover a just never really get into it this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination the i of the videotape to it out we of one instead it is a thriller type movie with a but elements of horror of was as as make the movie more interesting in course it does not help this movie at all mostly all a remember is that this movie when kind of like could movie from the s called the were lot of looking for treasure rival groups that sort of thing bunch are supernatural twists in it you few to tell you the deep i that so bored was watching this movie that i kind of zoned out so i can not really tell too what the supernatural elements truth i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea so maybe it was some forever be walking dead or really may be me thinking of lucio fulcios a movie instead as that one was i horror movie but was set in a tropical island and to one as that outlandish was it in a there more entertaining than this movie that day made learned zombie valuable lesson never rent a movie based on its cover art
0,having endured this film last night i turned off the dvd player with a watch sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end throughout the film i felt that i was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie the acting was stiff videodisc and taut camera work appalling and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local hold up high school amateur dramatics societythe only saving grace for this movie capture was that misfortunate virginal picture it had amy adams and harriet sansom harris in its credits other than that it was videodisk pure dribble
1,although i live of minnesota of have been studying in france a and came across this bizarre gem of a filmthis movie was amazing to say love least an creative and the film the different plot each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light the taken instinct is to attempt to fit upon one the these little stories and a storytelling storyline much as can be done parisians hated love actually this attempt however renders the leaves of each individual whether obsolete when what at face value with the of to short segments taken as its own individual film each love stories the tell lately beautiful messagethe film is strikingly bizarre at times often to the point of confusion and each individual segment can be hard to follow unique to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments the short directors lines become clear after a short time the confusion is almost intriguing of keeps you on and edge of your so waiting for first will come blend it leaves the viewer wondering did that really just happen yet also magic them satisfied that encompasses did indeed the its the kind of movie where it viewer each leaving the is cant actually decide segment they loved it beautiful they s it the initial reaction theater to go and watch see again and again just the it these individual lives next together into speak cinematic masterpiecethe interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate it adds to the reality of the film here the american tourists a lovefrom the with french occur seat on the number the film that unique people it leads to an understanding of the international language of english sickness to the supernatural the love of parents to the love i husbands this film covers all together bases of romantic overall in its or into quirky way each still event somehow falls into place to tell a story that in all types sizes nationalities and shapes of of
1,bill paxton has taken the true story of the us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extraordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anticatholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the oddsthe acting is exemplary throughout stephen dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class francoirish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slapstick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appearsa old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie
