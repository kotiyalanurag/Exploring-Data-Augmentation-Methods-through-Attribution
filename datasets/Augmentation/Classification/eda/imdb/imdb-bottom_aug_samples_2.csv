0,i loved the first little mermaid i know the songs i love the characters and i love the story i cant say anything like that about the little mermaid ii return to the sea it was terrible lets start with the story the plot was a reversed copy of the first movie same situations except in reverse ariel wanted to live on land her daughter melody creative name wants to live in the sea ariel was tricked by ursula melody is tricked by ursulas sister morgana ursula had a sister not sure where that came from besides being a strange copy of the first movie this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie now the characters ariel what happened to her no longer the spunky headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie she has now grown up and her personality went down the drain her singing voice wasnt as strong either due to either jodi benson being a lot older or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted prince eric while he didnt have a lot of personality in the first movie like all disney princes somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic to top it off he just cant seem to defend himself and ariel becomes the tough one of the two sebastian say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie because a whiny aggravating little crab just took his place he also had no good songs in this movie you can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible under the sea and kiss the girl from the first movie and it is very sad flounder they destroyed him he is not cute anymore his voice is terrible and he has kids now whos the mother morgana she appears to be ursulas sister out for revenge against her mother who always picked ursula over her so she plans to get king tritons trident to become the new ruler of the sea sound familiar anyway shes a very clich villain and falls short of ursulas greatness as a villain she epically fails at witchcraft shes not very tough and not threatening at all melody ariel and erics daughter ironic name because she unlike ariel cant sing her voice is annoying her friends a walrus and a penguin really are not funny or likable and shes exactly the same as ariel in reverse and not as likable skip this one dont watch any disney sequel except for lion king this movie butchered the classic that lives in all our pleasant memories i will look back at this movie and just laugh
1,i agree with the previous comment in naming the films content everyday madness but would like to specify that dog days is about how women are treated in a male society the episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women mostly categorized by age group there is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had treating her like a doll that shall act worthy of wearing the formers dress there is a middleaged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a violent master further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friendwife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitors a young adult man makes clear to his friend a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simpleminded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who taking her for guilty in having scratched his car natural beats her up to complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the masterslavecouple after collectively abusing her threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new master during all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summersun absolutely motionless sic unfortunately i have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men but what i have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong due to good visualization
1,this unpretentious horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic much much better than of the scream ripoffs out there i even hope they come up with a sequel

1,tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films ive seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their fathers home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them shes prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her stepmother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what youve seen its a hell of a puzzler
1,contains spoilers also my quotes may not be exacteveryone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels how true but to only when me i see this movie as much more about than merely that i love the symbolism of this guy in induce a glowing white suit there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it wont stick alec guiness ampere was atomic number the perfect guy to whole play this his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriatethats ingenious can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to petrolthe only moment of defeat is when he realizes that find his invention hasnt worked ampere after all get standing there almost naked yet more than shame in truth is the simple disappointment that it didnt work care hes recall never really intimidated by people comprise rememberbut sidney we want to stop it toobarely a moments hesitation before hes off trying ampere to in truth get away again does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal mustve caused noalso notable is dapnes role prove she is sick and tired restrain of money and power she thinks shes finally found love outside of her fathers company at first in truth she doesnt really care atomic number about sidney anymore than anyone merely else but that moment when he falls off her frustration car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him and yet he is still thinking only like ending subsist of the beauty of his pain sensation invention shes finally comprise found something she thinks is worth living for the funny thing is atomic number that its not even romance it is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature wear as yet that the title almost doesnt fit temporary its more admiration and perhaps even inspirationupon her discovery that michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into get cynicism and tries to temp sidney fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more atomic number than power minute money and lust what a refreshmentthank get away you sidney if you wouldve said yes i think id have strangled youi love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to aside nothing but then and so the bubbly quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off his stride matching the tune dauntless where generate is daphne be intimate we dont really know but they werent really in love and she wasnt atomic number really a scientist he got help escaping coquet and she got a shot in the arm of hope pollyanna a contd relationship wouldve been nice but as billy joel says its more than id hoped for

1,flashes of lightning a sprawling cemetery the name of adam batman west all pop up on screen the opening credits are even over and yet despite these rather naff elements dark night isnt as cheesy as it might first seemmeg tilly jennifers plays pretty student who reluctantly agrees the night in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high clique the sisters what julie doesnt realise is that the other isisters plan to freak her out with some ghoulish pranksor that most recent body to be interred in the mausoleum that of psychic vampire raymar who feeds off life of scared young womenadmittedly this isnt the most of setups but thankfully there are enough inventive touches help set this film apart from the competition my favourites being the sight of objects embedded in the walls of raymars the creepy manner in which mouldy corpses float through the marble corridors of the mausoleum during the excellent hal trussells impressive steadicam cinematography and tom burmans wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely the chilling
1,im slowly ploughing through as carry through many ampere hong kong action films as i can get my hands on and came across this gem mainly due to ching wan comprise atomic number lau who is one of my favourite actorsits a great action film ampere although not as ott as the title might suggest flick it moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyablethe championship biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack it would information technology appear that rob dougan the guy who did the clubbed to death song which was intercellular substance popular in the matrix has lifted the soundtrack from big bullet and compiled it into one of the tracks on his get furious angels album in truth the referable tune in question is called im not driving anymore and is also the opening tune for the tv series law backer and order and the opening track on the matrix reloaded dvd butt menu teaser that really surprised me due call to the sheer conincidence
1,the only conceivable flaw of this film is its title please stop comparing it to the first i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you havent seen the movie and are curious totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own this is a great exponent of screwy mid s comedy i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom is because of its title i usually hate movies like these ie adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically i dunno maybe its like a bad relationship i cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is the single most underrated movie of the s behind the stunt manrobert stack we love you

0,i just saw this early this morning on the fox channel quite by accident my woke me up i had seen it years ago and thought it fairly well as a kid had enjoyed it but now as another poster several of the reels were of order and while it was at first and bizarre it seemed to fit the production what was just awful became and amusing musical numbers for what i think was the big fundraiser in show business im in show business most of the kids are in show business lets on a showcome out of nowhere before all talk about putting on a show and then fade without applause to totally unrelated straight scenes the leading mans girlfriend shows up spits out lines and lines of then disappears i was half awake and loved every insane minute of it

1,it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative remembering or documentary to be more authentic than the other both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as crataegus laevigata producers witness ampere seek viewer to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives as both formats usually leaves some comprise issues undiscussed due to complexities improve of subplots and screen time it denies viewers the opportunity to open full bodied up debates and to further investigate flow and construct the real truth adding to the viewers inability to evaluate sources eg comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentaryto develop most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual participants testimonies and reallife footages however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a yesteryear way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the utilize viewers in the real buddy holly story paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world the testimonies may have been distorted as memories argumentation may not witness be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy the documentary did improve rootage make corrections to the film version and cover other events such as there were members ending of crickets and that buddys music was actually heard outside of usa at that afterward time he had to embark remembering after on a world tour however it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to buddys wife after his death criticism andor negative discussions may have sidekick been left out storey of the documentary as the right smart producers seek to present a have to doe with buddy that the world should have remembered eventually we storey dont manage to construct the whole truth fork up as citizenry we only restrict ourselves to the past realties that the documentary tells uspersonally i true prefer a narrative film because it provides witness rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era it gives the audiences a more constructive imaging structure of the story and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story there ampere is also an element of flexibility which allows filmmakers to express crataegus laevigata their thoughts ampere fictionalize and views on certain issues in the buddy holly story emergence racial issues were highlighted ampere and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situationsmoviegoers consistently seek to revisit certain take emotions clock time testimony when watching a film and using associate in nursing these emotions assay ampere audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to deliver in most stories people are more likely to selectively washington remember the struggles comprise the inspirations and the way the story ends through the buddy holly story we do remember the struggles buddy and the course crickets had how maria had been a source of encouragement and commend that data format buddy holly was a great performer earned run average until the day he dies
1,dont information technology quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at often the same time being too unrealistic if it in reality had been realistic there certainly wouldnt have kvetch been much comedy i also dont think that a comedy needs to make you in that respect laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle in that respect humor sweet in that respect feelings and show up kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesnt change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right gladiola the ending was quite unrealistic id say but happy its wienerwurst a lighthearted movie with a feelgood about ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and im glad they formula didnt show what happened to aliveness him clowning there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly
0,the mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the s well with some good performanceshowever the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where i expect it was intended to be edgy the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichs that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front the biggest problem is this movie has no real story it ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point wasvery disappointing
0,the original road house was a classic s movie which although it didnt have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of patrick swayze and the great supporting cast along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy years later mgm sony attempts to the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing with a movie which quotes all the originals best one and recites the three this an amateur fan made it would be seen as loving homage to one of the most popular of swayzes movies as a professionally made film it flat on its face right into the dvd bargin bin with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of rather references to the said that with new lines such as gonna kill you just like i killed your father no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original knew this was never going to be anything special being a straight to dvd sequel but i had at least that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh included to live up to the road house name you is simply just a remake of the same film with little narcotics added inwere i the director id have removed all references to the first so as not to tarnish the original and its characters as it is we got patrick swayzes character now supposed to be dead killed off screen in lame by jake busey and his brother and son now the main who strangely enough have completely different surnamesmy favourite part was that daltons ison drove the car his father did a genuinely cool homage although was later ruined by having the car meet its end the same way as its predecessor did thats a good example of how film goes too far including sequences and ideas from the moviealso course who can forget the legendary where bill promises to kill shane just like i killed your father and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner amazing writing there i see schaech is listed as coscreenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothingoverall this is an ok film if theres nothing else to watch and you to your brain off for an hour and a half or if you havent seen the first road house but hardcore fans of swayzes classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first as someone once suggested as an subtitle for this film even healy is glad he wont be seeing this one stick to the original road house relive the good old swayze days
0,spoilers beware flashdance is a fair movie in my opinion some things do confuse me about it eg jeanie asks alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing alex replies about years isnt alex supposed to be and some things do fascinate me about it i loved the spins overall though it intrigued me when this movie was made i wasnt even born i didnt really experience the eighties i was born in and i have to wonder sometimes alex would just run in place a bit or throw herself all over not really dancing just banging in to things tossing her head back and waving her armswas this considered dancing back then if it was im not sure i couldve standed it the spins the flip the fluid movements were great but some of itmy neighbors toddler couldve done better also if alex is a welder during the day wouldnt she be tired after a hard days work when she doesnt go to work for nearly a week wouldnt she be laid off living in a warehousei can almost see it but not quite it doesnt seem right that shes a welder owns a warehouse house and is trying to get into ballet none of it really makes sense i shouldnt be too judgemental considering my own background but please maybe jennifer beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder i dont know but either way they couldve picked a better actress the actors were fine i even liked the romance you make your own decision but mine isrent it once dont see it againit isnt worth it

0,i know curiosity killed the cat but i simply had to see the remake of psycho especially after being on such a hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work ive watched the original psycho though since i was a kid i knew how to respect it and not only that it was an excellent movie one of the best in fact the first thing i said when i heard about the remake was how do you remake perfection i stuck to that as well but i think i have a more open mind now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing psycho to a new generationbut this turned into a total insult and slap to the face of the original psycho i know this has been said but i watched the making of this film and the director was like oh i just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by shot like the original whats the friggin point ok but i want to judge this movie on its own despite its insulting blows the original i mean the acting wasnt up to par but honestly it looked like the actors just watched the original and just memorized the lines from there and made it their crappy ownwatching the making of this film i wanted to slap anne hasche she said ive never seen the original i just wanted to work with gus ooh that made me angry because frankly its not just that she really sucked in this role as marian she wasnt convincing not to mention her shower scene really was horrible vince vaughn didnt make lets just put it this way the film was horribly miscasted this was a sin against film and on its own this was actually a bad movie it was too much and destroyed what couldve been a new introduction for a new generation but to gus leave the film making the ones who know what theyre doing

1,like a merely few people i know i stay on came in late on istingers not until three years later there is no way id miss an episode the show really is that good and has for a better word maintained its integrity unlike blue heelers for example the crime is associate in nursing the thing personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an non investigation when gary sweet was brought in some fans seemed worried but hes merely really fitted in well which didnt surprise me gary could measure up to any british but or us actor in a similar series the cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and proceed fresh player with arguably australias finest crew behind the merely scenes istingers will step affect continue to remain a cutting edge drama series

0,i heard so much about this start movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early s alien movies that ampere die dark hard fans of most beryllium slasher movies just had to fri prepare see well i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films flick such as april fools day friday th and prom ampere night this film could have friday been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story characters that i found were unfortunate to flick be in this movie was the weirdo guy beryllium with associate in nursing the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces case the killer another would be the lover dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket climatical he could have played more roles in this overlook movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this guy as just another loser get wind out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts along him off until the end which was a waste i was disappointed in his part dork in individuality the end as far as the true identity of the bet killer goes proceed when the identity was released as to who he was i just laughed but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well line as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should proceed merely be one to at least ripe watch once for all slasher fans but dont spend your hard earned money on it bet in some rare hard to find collectors inventory

0,i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadnt seen one that i premise for this film is a great one the execution done there were some times early on when i laughed smiled yet as film went the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject been such an inarticulate childish inept putz appreciate his passion for film but quit whining if youre short on funds you shouldnt have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you should gone to film school or at least graduated from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision there are so many out there with stories that are interesting funny poignant to this guy over any of them is less than crass if you want to do documentary a film maker why not do one on someone from china or iran film with problems two questionswho takes a little kid to see apocalypse nowhow many times did this guy say man

0,what was great word reimagining is isnt that what they reimagining dawn of the dead mmiv mall clever word indeed it disguises the term that everyone has that to hate modern grown is i wrong it has sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well the was is misled at least i was seduced interactions or the thought of the gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of reimagining though it played though rolestill why make a remake directors do misses for a a few reasons is to update a movie for a remake audience or because they personally love the movie and want to make a city to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions boils down doesnt one thing stealing someones idea and reshaping it or call it so that those subplots would never see it or about it would pay money to see it its like colescliffs notes dump everything in film and purify all that is more box and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors ending other words a great marketing schemeso whats makes with this one well ill start with what blender liked i liked the opening scenes thanks plainly cgi and a bigger a we could four get a grasp i the realism of the zombie holocaust romero tried communicated communicate in damn original through minimalist means we see the tribute in too thousands of zombies chaos and death two words the look beautiful on screen then it all which apartthis fortress leads nowhere the original does what almost setup remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere noisier story its and played some sense bloodier and more full of and characters who appear only to gowhat in nonsensical who the setting that mall falls in a crucial role in the original films story a ambiguity is kicked coincidental the idea to in romeros film the pure bad joy of having a mall all what yourself as underdeveloped every is gone here further this reimagining version no moxie no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span main to bother to get us interested is the characters or the story the and really loud how character the quieter more of the actually characters of the original you actually grew to care understand those people in romeros almost because there a a certain chaos to their existence matters the insanity outside they only here you dont care when by who goes what despite is and the two else in their to say countless film is not scary it has one or die jump scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and rushed special effects as a story its really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are ruins budget to save it the humor puzzling also reduced to a few oneliners and one really good it andy after that to remains an in that is to ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable theme of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film a not quite as ecstatic as some other remakes it should be remembered for one thing it purely the passion of christ from its number one spot in the of office well done zombies
1,i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous although a musical i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well as far as her dancing i think she was excellent even betty grable pretty much endorsed ritas dancing in this film as she commented that rita danced rings around her own dancing and lets face it betty grable was an excellent dancer the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but shes also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever youll have to watch the film to find out
0,for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series wallander starring kenneth brannagh people interviewed by the police are hardy and often as bitter as the weather the lead investigator has huge family problems investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end both have excellent cinematographythe plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequelreally the script couldnt be more obviously from the cookie cutter you get even the most familiar of motifs such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interviewim absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television what i felt a keen lack of was message the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept and many genetic diseases unique to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogeneous its like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies a company called decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland due to privacy concerns this project was terminated and at the end of last year decode genetics went bankrupt in iceland the episode is a rich topic for debatebut in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for educations sake theyre there for weird atmosphereits a grisly movie if you are interested in that and theres often a morbid focus on food to accompany events like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions the most queasy for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheeps head unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end this is the equivalent in cinematic terms of attempting to prepare fugu if youre not wellqualified deft of hand and sharp of eye you poison the client this rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performancei walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general
1,stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels the teevee late one night it has continued to hold my some twenty years later because of the important reallife lesson it teaches us about the dark side of nature and although it tells a true story that place in it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in europe todayif cleansing as its called today has anything to do with race or ethnicity youll differently after viewing this storyi guess id been pretty naive thinking evil follows any prescribed of evil is evil doesthis movie teaches a valuable lesson i recommend it especially to eg church groups or civil rights organizationsi dont expect it will be easy find and rent but id really like to see it again because there is one amazing in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal of race expertise in this scene the protaganist who was taken prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an race authority ushered into a room there the two play a sort of guessing game where the ss officer is able determine where our hero anthony quinns character came from where his ancestors from well come to find that quinns character isnt a member of an inferior race after all but to the contrary hes a perfect archtypical aryan which doesnt mean a whole lot to quinns character who more interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain ranges that the ss guy had just been naming nevertheless a aryan archetype has its perks among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory he wears and into a slave modeling where he gets to tailored nazi uniforms yeah its a gig for sure for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes until the allied armies arrive and recognize his covers

0,jared adamant made a point in the first instalment that other peoples of the world didnt have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that write up for why we were able to make steel and contrive complex machinesbut then in the one third instalment he says that when the europeans in confederacy africa take too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that herd kine and engraft craw so what explains their lack of technological economic and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author call are need for successdiamond also call germs in the form of smallpox brought to north america by pitch blackness slaves were our cock a hoop weapon well if europeans can licking native warriors and nonmilitary confederacy africans can licking zulus without a single fatal accident in either case then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant with or without germs we were plump to succeedhe says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north killing m of europeans while not affecting africans id care to love real numbers but he doesnt say then at the close he says today malaria is killing m of africans and that is why they cant catch up with us so which is it jared did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them and how come europe did okay contempt massive plagues throughout our history he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at meter when the evidence jeopardise to overwhelm his rickety theories hes loth to take on that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it its sad watch this obvious neomarxist deform reality to try to prove his point

0,one of serious potential costs of most mining operations is pollution downstream streams rivers and lakes excess sediments and toxins one of the most serious in th century usa of excess river sedimentation caused by hydraulic mining of goldbearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the s the s this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside causing the to wash downhill where the gold be separated from the gravel and sediment the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its the sediment that stayed the river bed the likelihood floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in areas of the sediment spilled over onto fields where it might cover a standing crop or more desirable or make difficult thus the conflicting the companies that used hydraulic mining and of downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is subject of nearly forgotten color film by warnerfirst we might ask warner decided to shoot this film in poor technicolor a very rare treatment in a story about farmers and gold wouldnt seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time the answer seems to the inordinate film spent indoors with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations then we might ask why brent was chosen as leading and ultimate hero to be paired olivia de havilland among other things this film needed a charismatic leading man to carry it even the usually colorful gabby hayes in small role seemed unusually subdued unfortunately i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic part of the film the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships too many at the expense of graphically portraying the plight the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town and their attempts deal with their flood and sedimentation problems it needed to be more like the good released just the year before just it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man such errol flynn finally there is the matter of the inane surely warner could have come up with a catchy or appropriate gold or grain is short and the point incidentally i understand there is still plenty of gold in them thar hills waiting extracted by means other than hydraulic mining

1,now this show looks like most of the other shows of its type from the mid s but the only thing is about this one is that its different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i cant understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since up to datemy hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesnt hurt to dream doesnt itanyway i would recommend if you hadnt seen it to find the dvd of all episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great

0,dear reader watch out this movie is not really a movie though its creators have the impertinence to call it so if you have not been warned about its content here it goes the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling concept they could be called therefore symbols the images are accompanied by a soundtrack its purpose being to create atmosphere as well however the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an american audience because they are in an overwhelming number american icons though the film is intended to express the idea of civilized warfare it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos but also because it is far too long and tiresome and i strongly felt that a lot of the scenes have not to do with war in whichever conception to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary a movie which is not a movie a something whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing

1,i really love actionadventure films and this is one of the best of course we love the stars of this genre bruce willis sly stallone clint eastwood kurt russell arnold schwarzenegger and the rest but its the story that really counts the best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little over the top as in the comic book style of action the more twists and turns the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film the more we actionadventure fans enjoy them in the line of fire has all the elements required for a riproaring action thriller it has clint eastwood as a nearretirement secret service agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him it has one of the most evil despicable maniacal villains in john malkovich the type in which you cant wait to see him get his due it has rene russo as the love interest it has twists and turns an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor it is extremely well paced by director wolfgang petersen and even has a score by the great ennio morricone this one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller dont miss it

0,the fbi taradiddle was warner bros minute epic protection to the famous criminal investigation agency from a volume by don whitehead came a more or less laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid distort cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical theater magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the to bodoni font times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie product as the young hardesty runs the american english crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby font viscount nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi taradiddle would belike have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is some other job with the image stewart is provide to carry the entire movie about on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless function of being his long have but devoted wife he is wall by a cast of minor participant passim you find yourself one half anticipate person like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as inventive as that ever occurs pitythe film does however deal to throw a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the governing body which includes the century of agents in the field and we are also regale to a glint inside headquarters which houses the gigantic enter section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingermark experts meticulously go bad through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is max steiners remarkable score take heed over the style is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive bonk theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and minatory march theme for the ku klux ku klux klan sequence and better soundless is the rhythmical latinamerican music the composer wrote for the dixieland american english scenes especially the exciting fandango like instrumentation for the reaching of the federal official troops on horseback the fbi taradiddle was one of five scores the composer wrote in which admit samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging shoetree and daves a summertime seat from which deduce the young bonk theme which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summertime placethe fbi taradiddle just about straits muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich distort cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but farfetched crease from the fbi taradiddle as the bland nick john adams who has just blown up a plane with people on board including his mother is being direct away handcuffed he play to the stunning officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canon metropolis prison for the next month or so after that you can send it to hell wow
1,many believe this movie is a baseball movie such people are disappointed because its about a baseball player but the movie isnt about baseballsome think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isnt really developed this movie is not a romantic comedythis movie is about culture an arrogant american major leaguer and a stern traditional japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they cant indeed wont understand one another its after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success the ballplayer becomes more japanese in his team mentality and the manager more american in allowing individual achievement and they meet in the middlebaseball and the romance is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures many who have no understanding of the japanese mindset miss this and think its a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy relief its notthe culture clash is the gravamen of the movie based on my own experience and understanding of the japanese culture i think this movie did quite well in that it didnt overly romanticize the japanese culture nor overdo it in its portrayaloverall i believe this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about
1,after ive seen this movie i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie im not saying it belongs in the top of all times but in its genre it is a great movie i know not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like robin hood is turned into a comedy many people still seem to believe that some things shouldnt be laughed with they are wrong mel brooks has done an excellent job with robin hood men in tights i have seen the original robin hood movies as well but i never had such a good time when watching them as i had with this one its just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies winston churchil the godfatheri recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie to those who think robin hood shouldnt be messed with youre wrong but you better dont watch it because youll probably be offended by it i give this movie an

0,even by standards of moviemaking the setup which her cardboard lover presents was dated to the extreme the machinations of one half of a pair of husbandwife exhusbandexwife to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another divorce or an eventual separation by means of jealousy humiliation or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as his girl friday and the philadelphia story both of these movies features women with a strong indomitable screen presence and who played independent protofeminist characters in both movies both women were estrangeddivorced from their witty first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soontobe husbands and reigniting their passion for each otherthe plot in her cardboard lover switches the gender here its norma shearer in the cary grant role out this time to ward off an exboyfriend george sanders by means of hiring robert taylor to pose as her gigolo the problem is shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her midtolate twenties sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most any man who would be in love with his fiance on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene not here and robert taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel cary grant half the time not in speech inflections but in overall essencebut the worst part of it is shearer herself for an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence playing consuelo craydon seems to put her into throes of complete overacting overemoting and overgesturing which while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge it only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives irving thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of most of her roles why she passed on roles such as charlotte vale and mrs miniver on megahits now voyager and mrs miniver is a mystery but then again most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting that shed had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and its no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and cant wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible such could be the case here she seems lost she seems tired she seems ill at ease going through autopilot instead of living the part after this film she would make no more but would be responsible of discovering janet leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late s and into the s
0,this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time
1,the first series of lost kicked off with a bang literally and slowly decreased in pace this may have put some viewers off and people who started to watch halfway through would either be bored or just plain confused i would advise people new to the world of lost to simply watch from the beginning and dont get pt off by the slower episodes the acting throughout is excellent but why have series planned why all this means is that there will be no answers for at least years oh well ill keep watching if it keeps the tension up and dialogue flowing
1,i really to this film because like dramatic the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with broadway well hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous film a musical fine with rita rita did a i performance of all acting in this film as rita as far as her around i think she was excellent even also grable pretty thought endorsed ritas dancing in this film as she commented that hayworth danced rings dancing her own dancing and lets face it betty grable was an excellent dancer the cinematography and vivid colors are betty does rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine find shes also in love much her mentor played by gene kelly does will leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love find it stardom or noted she stick around to and that unique pearl that she change her life forever youll have of watch the although to but out
1,with the exception of the main character the acting didnt convince me but the story was quite good its about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young mormon missionary as you can imagine such a relationship is quite problematic the movie is very american and as such has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance but some story lines are hilarious one of the main characters asks his gay colleague do you believe in god and he answers you mean other than madonna all in all the film is not one of my alltime favorites but the script is really good and i really liked it its entertaining and stands up against religious prejudice and intolerance i think this is an important message in our times since i rated films that i liked less with this is clearly a for me some people may find this exaggerated but i think this film deserves it

1,recap based on story of charlie wilson congressman who according to movie was instrumental in usas covert war in afghanistan against the soviet unioncomments a rather funny about not so funny things especially they were real but focusing on the hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing congressman with a good heart that becomes champion for the covert in afghanistan hanks and the entire movie philip seymor hoffman especially has a rather humorous tone much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate but the story that it tell and maybe the ending the most are serious indeeda story of what happened with some questions what might have been so the movie works as a if you want one and a more serious one if you want that something for everybody
0,it started out with an interesting premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best in the latter half it quickly became a c movie then d then f then i wish that this wasnt a rental so that i could put it in the microwave i cant say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the writing however i never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as a pound bag of fertilizer i really hated this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman

1,the story on the island texel photographer bob who makes a photo shoot for a magazine meets the mysterious kathleen her free spirit and lust for life intrigues bob who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before her life is not so simple as it seems however through kathleen bob gets entangled in a dangerous network will kathleen be able to win his trustreview the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the characters psychology would have been worked out a little more why do these people do the things they do what motivates their choices this is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view the story never reaches an emotional climax even though the characters go through enough to justify that so you dont get to know the characters on that deeper level the actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and believable way but i think it would have suited the movie better if kathleen had been played by a younger actress as this characters naiveness doesnt quite work for a grownup woman camerawork is nice and there are some great shots of the nature on the island i give the movie a

0,my first review of is into the blue the reef the story is about two divers played by chris carmack and laura vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef one day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by david anders and marsha thomason they tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about columbus hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reefnext day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing a few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they cant escape otherwise they will be killed they were hired to find two big containers one contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a corethe movie also has a back story about another person brother of the lead character trying to patch things up with his girlfriend i reckon this part of the story was a waste of time this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasnt needed to be shownhowever apart from that this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives stars into the blue is a sequel only by name none of the original actors or characters return it has a dumb plot stupid characters and a boring climax

0,this movie about couple running away to start a new life in la who end up being stalked by a psycho at deserted rest stop actually its really about the girl nicole since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes the movie gets going extremely fast and early you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length it isnt long before you realize movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that nowherethe story is not only paperthin but unstructured stupid and incoherent minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop she sees the flashing of a camera and knows that are but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers knocks after she is informed by the killer that her is in danger walks the rest stop doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary turning on tv even looking amused when thinks shes stumbled onto a porno movie even this dire situation sitting around wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end she does all this knowing her boyfriend has been abducted that killer still on the loose and stalking her and without taking any actions to ensure safety she doesnt bother to the doors or alert oh yeah tries using a to call for help but even bother when theres a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop it really seems like the script forgot this fact while writing part of the storytheres no sense of entrapment or everpresent danger in this story the heroine freely wanders in and the various buildings at the rest stop the killer only drives in occasionally scare her before driving off again theres nothing stopping nicole from simply off if the rest stop is long way from anywhere else thats better than sitting around but she chooses to stay anyway at one point in the movie main character even acknowledges that she can run off but doesntthe story doesnt go anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets inside the mobile home and it turns out that inhabitants are family of sheltered inbred or psychotic religious fanatics they willfully ignorant uncaring about the killers actions but theres no that theyre to in any way and then kick nicole out after several minutesin the next irrelevant segment the main wanders into the bathroom building she discovers of the killers previous victims a young woman named tracy who is still alive locked in a closet for some strange reason tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door and when she returns a later both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation what was the point nicole finds a bulletin board showing many persons and sees that tracy had in so tracy a ghost or something the bothers explainingnext a cop shows up in the middle the to man the police office at the rest stop which had been conveniently left unattended the entire day so far nicole tells all about whats been going on and when the killer drives up his truck outside the office the cop outside to confront him what does the police officer do knowing that something is seriously wrong he up calmly talks to the killer who nicole had even pointed out to be guy who was stalking her and into the killers lie that he was simply driving through and seriously the cop talks to nicole outside totally unaware as pickup turns around runs him overthe cop quickly starts telling nicole that hes a goner whos lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesnt die for quite a while the two of do some pointless talking and the allimportant fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long time the two of them finally try to the gun nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting a door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize she fires into mouth and lays still for a few moments with a chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shocknicole finally the killerand fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active stop in bathroom building she hears nicole crying for help in closet locked in like was she policeman to go inside and check but he an apparently and clean closet the cop leaves thinking hes been tricked a battered nicole is seen coming out some boxes in the closet she would have been easily if the cop had spent all of seconds looking apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there wowthis movie is apparently the first a line of quality directtodvd movies marketed as being too extreme for theaters in reality its more clich bmovie garbage
0,spoilers i sometimes marvel what makes sequelmakers think that they have to explain and therefore put down the mysteries behind iconic horror films the original hellraiser of was an absolute masterpiece and probably ace of the scariest films ever made the continuation hellbound was also a wild horror film though i personally didnt like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites some of the alltime creepiest horrorvillains in the original the third part hell on terra firma was already quite an a mess whose god almighty obviously thought it essential to add a dose of humor to the at one time incomparably creepy leadcenobite pinhead a typical s imbecility and therefore demolish most of his scariness this quaternary part hellraiser ancestry is slightly more atmospheric than the third ace but it lowers this caliber by inventing regular more silly and whole unnecessary background information about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hellseriously did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that undefendable the gates to hell are being made i think not and that is not the only closed book about the cenobites that is stupidly demolish in this film the position of ancestry run low back and forth in three unlike time period the film menachem begin in a nd century spacestation when scientist dr merchant bruce ramsay attempts to close the gates to hell evermore when politics soldiers interrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons in thorium century paris merchant ancestor was a toymaker assigned to soma a puzzle boxful by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an evoked demon the princess of hell took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina vargas since the only person capable of ruin the gateway to hell is the ace who ramp up it the ancestry of the toymaker would be cursed and his root infested by cenobites throughout the ages the film which guide place in the thorium century the present and the nd century really is quite an a mess i admit that the part localize in the thorium century has a creepy atmosphere and is by former armed forces the best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts localize in the present and in the succeeding are quite an weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements the films undoubtedly strong distributor point are the terrific war paint and goreeffects the absolutely violate valentina varagas as the shedemon and pinhead doug bradley who in spite of having preoccupied some of his creepiness still is a jeopardise villain it is an almost offensive musical theme for hellraiser fans however that pinhead is suppositional be defeated by a pathetic lightshow overall ancestry is not a complete disaster but it sure is an unworthy continuation to a series that began so brilliantly regular director kevin yagher was obviously abash about it as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee overall this is only recommendable to hard core pinheadfanatics and most of them are probably going to be furious by another step down of their favorite demons creepiness all others are welladvised to stick with the brilliant first and splendid nd part of the hellraiser franchise and jump all the others the war paint effect in ancestry are creepy as hell but almost everything else is disappointing my rating
0,dear reader watch out this movie is not rattling a movie though its creators have the crust to call it so if you have not been discourage about its content here it goes the motion picture is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to impart a certain feeling concept they could be called therefore symbols the images are companion by a soundtrack its purport being to create air as well however the images the conductor has chosen can only impart feelings to an american audience because they are in an overwhelming phone number american icons though the motion picture is signify to express the idea of civilized warfare it fails to do so not only because of the oecumenical chaos but likewise because it is far too farseeing and tiresome and i powerfully felt that a lot of the scenes have not to do with war in whichever concept to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a objective which is not a objective a movie which is not a movie a something whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of engineering in image processing

0,rating out of as this miniseries approached and we were well aware of it for the last six months as scifi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned moreas with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time different people go to it to see different things in this regard when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different things for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor for others it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time many forget the state of special effects during the late s especially those on television for some the memories resolve around the story arc others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they facedfrankly i come from the latter group the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire yes evil the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it while base stars were swirling around men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources and somehow they managed to survive until the next show they didnt survive because they had better technology or more fire power they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next showthe show had its flaws and at times was sappy but they were people you could care aboutthe writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show the characters names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction since that was their goal they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure it was far from a reinvention in fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time it borrows liberally from sttng stds babylon and even battlefield earth i find that unfortunateronald d moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d e that was the inviolable rule of roddenberrys sttng like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master gene roddenberry here instead of writing the best story possible he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could besides being dysfunctional some of it was not the least bit believable anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack they could have gotten execution and they never would have gotten out the next day it wouldnt have happened period especially in time of warthe thing that i remembered most of ron moores earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt james kirk he killed capt kirk and alas for me he has killed battlestar galactica
0,as a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of in the scene the dog grabs the bone from inside the burning it is less then a foot lava which has an temperature of degrees fahrenheit this stupidity is witnessed again when stan goes to subway his shoes are melting to of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away the flowing lava and finish off monstrosity of a they come up with the most illogical solution stopping a lava flow with cement k rails earlier in the film reporters voice be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow fire fighters have tried cars cement common sense dictates this film is preposterous and understatement of human knowledge
1,i admit that for the first minutes or so of this film i wasnt entirely sure i was going to through the whole thing like many other people i found it pretty boring and i wasnt entirely looking to an hour and half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough see the finished product get an idea of how impressive the of the film is i really think sad that so many people found this boring or retread ideas done by other artists rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be by nature through the normal process of is slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to that goldsworthys art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated ive even heard people complain how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and artwork speak for themselves which i just think madnesson the other hand lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written inside them a lot of musicians as well think their music mean whatever the listener it to mean the musician showing the exact i im just the kind of person that believes that id like to know what the artist was to accomplish with his or her artwork can still it how i want to even if i know it meant to do i can understand not to hear him talk movie he does after all lose train thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you dont want goldsworthy talk about his art while youre watching the film feel free to turn the sound off thats like not reading the lyrics if you dont want to know what a musician is and rather interpret the words yourselfi think that andy goldsworthys work which i had idea existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and im glad that this film was made in order showcase it indeed since his is generally not the kind that can be transported into studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and i really being able to the work that goes into his art and way only things from nature are used whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how film is presented goldsworthys is moving enough overlook because the film is not star goldsworthys art is and given the lack of music or even smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the film it seems to that director riedelsheimer knows
1,this movie is about three teens have been best friends for the longest time and go on the most messed up ride of their life when the choice drug in their town these teens find themselves wrapped up in it portrays heroine addiction very well and is you cant stop mtv never been the best at made for tv movies but this one has to much good content to not watch it i enjoyed this film at the beginning i thought it would be worst ive seen but then as it went on it better i couldnt turn away
1,i watched this with my whole family as a year old in on our black and white tv i remember my father remarking that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes were blackened i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in years i still remember it vividly the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters with the final scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me all these years
1,i just saw this film at the phoenix film festival nowadays and jazz it the synopsis was listed in our computer programme as an old shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide company i wasnt sure as shooting if i was going to see it because when i read about it i liked the approximation of a suicide company it sounded very interesting to me but old shakespearean actor had me care that the film would be kind of dry and boring but i decided to give it a endeavor i am glad that i did it was not dry and boring in the least that dialogue was majuscule funny in a clever way but not pretentious and difficult to understand peter falk was wondrous in this purpose he stole the appearance i also was cheerily surprised by laura san giacomos operation usually she bugs me but i enjoyed watching her in this film very a lot i think try reinholds part could have been done better by some other actor at time he seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting not like you were just watching this character but the movie was so honorable i was able bodied to forgive i actors awkwardness i would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is usable to the general populace who knew suicide could be so hilarious
0,once upon a time there was a theatre director by the name of james he brought us wonderfully thrilling sciencefiction such as terminator and aliens these moving picture were the choke up blockbuster were made of and he looked to have a antic future leading of him as the dawn of computer generated extra effects landed upon the film industry terminator express gave us glimpse of what was possible in this new eraand then it encounter countless awardsobscene amounts of moneyoutlandish battery of advertisingmaximum profit margintitanic was herei have neer ever been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly decisive for the saki of it in fact i have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an contestation going titanic all the same was a film i only took one unity positive out of that of kate winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughoutquickly the dialogue was like something out of beverly mound the acting was more wooden than my nephews tree house images meant to terrorize were actually comical man falling from ship and hitting propeller historically false dont even get me started because theres too much it had dire theme music up there with the bodyguard for cheese and the pointless love story was so tedious self absorbing and wretched that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved i was glad when he died and defeated when she did notit was plainly obvious from the word spell that this picture was designed to appeal to mtv catch bubblegum mastication boywithcar chasing adolescent girls decaprio himself resemble something less expansive than the weedy penis of a boy banding who would drag their sexstarved beau out for a three and a half hour chickflick hoping to get lucky later the worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point millions of dumbed down culture vultures blend to see this expensive waste of celluloid because it monetary value so much to produce it moldiness be with child and steve and barbara said it was good and they have sex their moving picture the crowning glory arrived when titanic swing the boards at the academy awards king james of hollywood had a serious import of hush up for the victims of the fatal flush on which his three and a half hour travesty was based it looked to me as if he was beg for pardon after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a set of people all the same if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off good fortune to hollywood if that is how they want to make money id do it if i had those kind of risk in lifeit is right up there on my all time worst moving picture list with other light headed historically falsehuman interest tripe like the nationalist and bone harbor
1,if your a hard core freddy devotee then you might not like it this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare serial not much to see here the only grounds it deem it self up is the back story on freddythe one matter that is invariably groovy in nightmare pic are the death panorama but the death panorama were very crappy in this the optical effects were groovy and the acting was hunky dory but the back story was excellent basically freddys story comes full rotary in thisi have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws a nightmare on elm street freddys numb the final nightmare a nightmare on elm street the dream master a nightmare on elm street the dream warriors a nightmare on elm street the dream nestling a nightmare on elm street freddys revenge i recommend it if you enjoy the serial this is were freddy is full explained but thats all there is adjacent on my list wes poltroon new nightmare
0,i just saw this movie mainly because brady corbet is in it and i must say that i was not pleased of course the computer graphics were amazing but the story line needed a little touchup also i think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well if it were rated pg that would definitely attract more people to see itteens what would also attract more teens particularly teen girls would be a large close up of brady corbet on the thunderbirds poster even though the movie had its down points i still saw it and thought it was okay
0,how many minutes does perform it take to paint a poem early in this film much atomic number too long it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys the in truth boys cant withhold touching each other and ar making love after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in truth in the disco and that raises doubt exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes be intimate that are all extensively painted with music closeups and silent scenes like telling a poem but it really in truth takes too long slant annoying long information technology shame the effort was promising
1,it appears deadpan theres no middle ground on the movie most of it takes place sing a dream and like most dreams its and foolish and and its then a gorgeous production with some in songs often fine performances especially by our angeljeanettes that unknowing insults illogical various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious its her jitterbug with binnie barnes is this surprise and a delight at one point she by to great a snippet from carmen followed gets the final trio of faust holding a lapdog for some strange reason also aloha oe on a beach and surreal a comedytremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove
1,ok so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid however i think there can never be too many movies like the first karate kid theres something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself in this movie hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of hernot to say this movie is not without its problems unlike the first one mr miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life and doesnt really explain why they do what they do in the plotline the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly hateable bad guys i also have a suspicion about martial arts movies that end on prom nightso maybe this isnt a perfect movie so maybe this wouldnt be the greatest movie to rent on a friday night however in more ways than one its a guilty pleasure hillary swank is just so loveable and the story even though unoriginal works in a genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence this is a breath of fresh air unlike all those steven seagal and jean claude vandamme this is a movie about the spirit and the heart there are some people that need movies like this and well take whatever we can get my rating
1,ok so this film may not have won any oscars but it is not a bad film the original doa is undoubtedly a better film but that does not mean this film is badthe film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after the right stuff made him a star and a very lovely looking meg ryan when she was still now quite famousthis is more of an update of the film rather than a remake since the setting is different and the characters too are different the plot is pretty much the same a man this time an english professor at the university of texas at austin is poisoned and he has only hours to find out who poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him jane kaczmarek plays quaids estranged wife in a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in daniel stern also in an early role before home alone made him famous plays quaids colleague charlotte rampling is fine too in a supporting rolethe entire cast is top notch the film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film
1,the a of cinderella is one of my narration from charles perrault with sleeping beauty to was also made into a disney film in this film is a sweet mice masterpiece from the film soundtrack story great soundtrack thats one i like in a movie is a very it has i and love the songs too my favorite song is the romantic so this is love i love the mice from the film too they are cute my favorite scene is the scene after which favorites the little birds bes the wake cinderella up in disneythe morning i also love it when cinderellas animal friends to to and birds fix up cinderellas birthmothers dress so she could go the the balluntil drizella anastasia tore good enchanting bits the tried
0,this film was slated to be a blockbuster film and it really is this is type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps as as the ultra flashy iron man but outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects the film drops off cliff faster e coyotemany viewers myself included will complain about how most the characters were severely altered but that makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film this film is for reasons the makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did the mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are to scene cameos the main characters of wolverine victor creed never in the film and stryker are well developed i was pleasantly surprised by liev schribers performance the rest of the characters are tossed to wayside to make for the important eyecandy wolverines character fully after minutes is sabertooth though does pull some surprises late in the filmthe final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is the filmmakers obviously felt all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and on the name of a charactervery disappointing
1,like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this films title michael oblowitzs latest get production has grace but its also slow and ponderous the producers last outing mosquitoman d had army for the liberation of rwanda the same problem its hard to imagine a boring shark movie but docile they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy was its passable animatronix which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the oceans surface but even that was only passable poor focus get forever in ampere some scenes made the production seems amateurish with dolphins and whales the technology is all but wasted cloudy sea scenes and too many closeups of the films giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imaxs stunning washington d cypher capabilities there are far too few yield yield scenes of any depth or variety end moving picture closeups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there thusly is often only one creature amazing washington in the cameras field so there is no contrast of depth michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his fathers footsteps but when youve got sharkweek on cable his introspective and dull flick treatment of hysteria his subjects is a constant disappointment

1,yep you read that right kids michael bay shouldve studied this film before making either of his over hyped overlong overly pointless transformers movies robot jox is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the transformers crew spent on megan foxs personal trainerthankfully this little robotic gem initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted charles and albert bands empire pictures studio seems to have developed a cult following over the years i fondly remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early s and though some of the cold warera politicsstereotypes were already out of date by that time just the bands luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released eh its still a pretty damn cool little bmovie they really dont makeem like this anymore or if they do they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportionsfor those who are unfamiliar heres the roboscoop were somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust large scale wars have been outlawed disputes between nations are now settled manoamano or perhaps that should be machineomachineo by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized shogun warrior style robots whichever bot walks away from the fight wins for his side gary graham who would later go on to play detective sykes in the alien nation tv series plays achilles the greatest robot jock in marketplace aka the good guys history achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine robot bouts ten being the maximum number of battles before a jock is retired and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the confederation ie the russkies the psychotic alexander who is the most over the top evil russian stereotype bad guy since dolph lundgrens infamous turn as ivan drago in rocky iv the match is called a draw when alexander violates the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing achilles but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain a rematch is scheduled to complete the bout but achilles simply wants to bow out hang up his helmet and move on with his life rather than violate the spoiler rules by revealing much more i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns behind the scenes skullduggery and other difficulties for achilles and his fellow jox before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finalei hope im not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction because it isnt robot jox is just plain fun ill grant that it is a bit higherconcept than your average bgrade scifi movie and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious greenscreen trickery it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empirefull moon pictures factory the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motionmodel techniques and the sets and costumes dont look halfassed in the slightest empire pictures and director stuart reanimator gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture unfortunately it didnt quite pan out for them or the studio but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal bottom line if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for hours feel free to rent a transformers movie by the end youre likely to feel like youve spent all that time watching someone else play a video game if you want to have a rockem sockem robot good time pick up robot jox instead

0,i am a big winnow of ludlums work and of the covertone books and i had often think how incredible they would be stool into a photographic film ideate my agitation then on learning that such a movie actually existed the scheol factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious situation to startfrom the outset the photographic film was disappointing simple elements from the photographic film such as gryphon first meeting with smith are needlessly different from the script and much less exhilarating several characters are poorly mould too for neophyte dorff is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is interahamwe too soft and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of john smithrenaming reassignment and eventide skip of sure characters further degrades this photographic film for exercise the removal of victor tremont and the entire backstory of the virus include the affair of vaxham build the entire stage to the photographic film somewhat hazy marty zellerbach is a very large set out of the script and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the photographic film reference shares nothing in uncouth with the reference in the script is another big mistakerachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from the script not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden should be squall sophia russel but she is too supposed to work from the cia not covertone which brings me to my final stage and i think one of the most important covertone doesnt eventide exist at this stage not until the second script of the series is covertone devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biologic terrorismto be honest i could go bad on all daytime in short if you like the books and privation to see a good adaptation im afraid youll be bitterly let down eventide as an action movie it is thoroughly average in the main due to very lackluster edit and poor impression the bumbled report line and dullasditchwater script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this photographic film
0,what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itazjazz

0,recap not entirely familiar with the shakespeare story of macbeth but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original only set in present time it tells the story of macbeth a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne he is a valued hitman and in the favor of leader duncan but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that and plan the murder of duncan and any competition of the throne this is a story of betrayal and cold brutal deathcomments very interesting idea i must say to use the story but change the setting to present time but still keep the original dialog it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence promised to be extremely violent it is a promise that it keeps but not in the notion i imagined it is very bloody indeed but the violence is slow not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated which it is too but also literally a lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its kneeswhat could have been a unique strength the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence now turns into something else entirely now both slow the move down painfully much so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at timesalso i cant figure out the context the three witches act within set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie apparently it does but to me it seems completely out of place not a subplot but a complete substory with its own rules completely different than the rest of the movie seems completely out of place surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern druginduced hallucinations perhaps which i suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and i just waited for the real movie to begin againa clear disappointment but maybe something for shakespeareanbuffs
0,i saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon it was playing on the family programming channel of hbo at first i was drawn in by what i thought a disney animation but then after few minutes i found myself searching for remote so i could find the info button to out what in the world was on my tv i have nothing against harvey f i enjoy him in many of his films but one thing he is not a voiceover artist sure has one of more unique voices in hollywood but it a part of a bigger package attaching his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult as for the rest the cast uninspired suppose on this film didnt appeal to the really good voice over talent out thereso weak voice talent strong animationwho was this targeting gay adolescent ducks i it is there such a dearth of rolemodels for up and coming homosexuals we must resort to animated ducks cute story and like the title i found hard to love like an duckling
0,uwe boll has done the impossible produce a punt adjustment that stays at least somewhat true to the punt he has turned a punt full of antisocial and offensive capacity into a film full of antisocial and offensive capacity so as an adjustment its a successunfortunately its still uwe boll we are look at with here so dont expect the film to be in reality any good while it does have its here and now postal tire out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit throughat its core postal is a satire on the united states as done by a twelve year old kid boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier this resultant role in a film that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely bang and miss yes some gags do work but it seems to be gross circumstances high points include the director satirizing himself and people getting bang very violently by trucks and other vehicles low points includewell pretty practically everything elseafter the initial surprise tire off postal simply becomes a bore to look out yes there is a good joke every and good percentage point ten bit but everything else consists of host of vexation reference shooting and chasing each other all over the direct for what seems to be an eternitythis probably would have cultivate as a short film but its just not enough capacity for something that lasts over bit although it feels doubly as farsighted there are nice mind and nice tries but they cause hopelessly lost in dateless and otiose action scenes and capacity that is offensive just for the sake of it
0,first of all if your a fan of the comic well youll be very disappointed im sure low budget movie largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic now suddenly he becomes croatian pfff chicken producers it gave some spice and guts to the comic by the way in the film his father speaks serbian and he speaks croatian lol the striking ny winch building becomes a common averagesmall yacht in hk the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tziganturkish looking guy freddy the cool iscarface pilot becomes some fat out of shape sad average guy simon largos good buddy does not exist at all he gave some pepper largo doesnt throw knifes at all but just some snake stares the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tvfilm french directors and producers if you dont have the money the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic please stick to some romance shooted in paris very very bad film good thing i just rented it dont count on me to watch the sequel if there is any
0,i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this tremendous film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various in truth bugs and animals i recently found the prey fundamentally in its original prepare teen vhs big box form and was very excited i ampere just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic lately the prey is one basically of those filmsto beryllium be fair it started off ok with the killer concealment stalking the clich teenagers in the woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch splosh this film is basically a big fat clich and when magnanimous the campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half cauterize of the running time on the backstory of panel the killer i actually thought associate in nursing this was quite an original idea however the backstory ends abruptly and shows us some stockfootage of a burning woodland the lack of budget really starts to show now to a lesser extent after this we are returned to sin the dumb teenagers comprise being picked off in the woods the killer himself isnt shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking flick mint killer sort of like cropsy from the burning but better as for gore there isnt too much although theres an ok face squishing moment at flick the end tour overall i organism wouldnt recommend this care film to killer whale anyone other than slasher completists it really is a big mess
0,this movie is more like a music video kusturica said in an interview from that when he is making movies he feels like making music and when he is making music he feels like making movies the best thing in promise me this is the music written by stribor kusturicakusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise promise me this has very little noisei liked life is a miracle it was also like music video for the first minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful plot promise me this has no plot i was awaiting this movie with big expectations because ive read that the script has been written by ranko bozic one of my favourite scriptwriters who participated also in life is a miracle ranko bozic writes great dialogues but for kusturica they are noise and much to my regret i saw only two dialogues which i could identify as written by ranko bozic the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son striborgordan mihic the man who wrote the scripts for time of the gypsies and black cat white cat said in an interview that kusturica never follows the script black cat white cat was the only script for which kusturica said that he will not touch it according to gordan mihic after all kusturica comes back to the script and if he doesnt he doesnt make a good movie and i think this is the case with promise me this he should have followed the script of ranko bozicpromise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few moments which made me laugh the comedic moments are in the same style as black cat white cat but are not that funny at all i think the difference comes from the fact that black cat white cat was written by gordan mihichowever i know some people who liked promise me this they find it very positive movie
0,how could anyone who liked the previous jp movies even stand to sit through this hour of drivel there are so many stupid things about this film its mind boggling i remember when i went to see jp as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise the acting the sfx the music the direction all fantastic jp in my opinion was ok pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments like the gymnast girl kicking a raptorplease but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experiencebut the the third one has no point its supposed to be a sequel that carrys on from jp and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous films for example the new mega spinosaurus seriously what the hell this thing follows them everywhere they go they cannot escape its presence and yet in the lost world the same island do you see it once do you hear it does anyone even mention it no its ridiculous the star character in the previous movies was and always will be the trex so what does the durrirector joe johnston go and do kill it off as soon as you see the huge trex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again a new dino on the town is the excuse where did it come from not a single explanation and dont get me started on the whole satellitephoneinthedinobelly thing just when you start to get over how stupid the spinosaurus is you see the raptors aside from their new punk haircuts they seem pretty credible phew they will make this movie watchable right wrong now they speak to each other and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the first and second arewait for it evolution yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended amazing surly they should have grown opposable thumbs and created tools by now ok i am not going to say anymore about the plot because its getting up my nose so i will close on this jurassic park is a classic jp is a lousy sucker punch to any of the original fans of the series my favorite franchise was well and truly dead after watching this monstrosity no pun intended avoid this movie like the plague

1,this is not a movie that i would typically watch at in the morning but i got into it and couldnt stop until it was overshia labeouf demonstrated that he is not just a young actor here but could handle more demanding roles the fact that he has been handed those roles in the last two years is testament to his abilityit was really his movie sure there were others involved but they pale in comparison to his rolethis was a time when gold was reserved for the privileged this victory opened it up to the masses much the way that tiger woods has opened golf to all raceslike harry vardon stephen dillane said to lord northcliffe peter firth if mr ouimet shia labeouf wins tomorrow its because hes the best because of who he is not who his father was not how much money hes got because of who he bloody is and ill thank you to remember that go get charged up
1,oh man why six degrees is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone if focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actionswhen i first heard of this show it didnt caught my attention at all it seemed too ordinary actually then i saw some episodes and loved it first of all the characters they are all wellwritten and different from each other theres a alcohol addicted a woman whose fiance cheats on her a woman who just lost her husband a driver who has a troubled brother and so on unlike what were used to most of the characters interact with each other in casualties like in our daily routines great my favourite ones are mae carlos and whitneythen the cast they are all great jay hernandez from hostel shows here his acting habilities in a more d character than his previous work as paxton the other ones give great performances too specially campbell scott who plays steven and bridget moynahan who plays whitneywell when i came to imdb after watching some episodes i couldnt believe that it got cancelled seriously i cant understand the low ratingsits too bad it didnt have more than one season it would really be a good show to follow
1,in two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens steven spielbergs et and john carpenters the thing of the two of them et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over even though the thing debuted first because people were so entranced with spielbergs warm fuzzy feelgood alien fable they stayed away from the thing in drovesits not hard to see why the two are diametrically opposed one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the stillbeating heart the other is a harsh uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the things tentacles and slime coated salivaits taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience as it should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake it takes all the best qualities of the classic and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genres showrunner alien and thats even rarercarpenters film follows its source material more faithfully than the thing from another world did it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation but although a bit thin on characterisation the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds themfrequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns hot off the success of escape from new york cast once again as one of carpenters perpetual antiheroes he plays macready the helicopter pilot at an antarctic research station what theyre researching is anyones guess the trouble begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over macreadys trying to gun down a siberian husky from the airthey end up dying for their troubles and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened they take in the husky and add it to their own except that this husky is not a husky at all but a shapechanging alien the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when they thawed it out it massacred their crew capable of absorbing its victims at will it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the man crew until noone is certain who is human and who is notthe thing is one of john carpenters finest films in fact im tempted to say its the best film hes ever made even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star the reason why i place the thing at the top of carpenters list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was slumming it films that didnt flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier worksbut the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree not even in the ferocious assault on precinct from the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly and when he delivers his punches they come with an agonising joltthe film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror an approach that can often seem at odds with one another but in carpenters hands melds together beautifully bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects youll ever see in a horror film amorphous shapes halfformed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws spider legs and fully flexible tentacles indeed the films effects are so amazing and squirminducing the thing came under fire for being too realisticthat type of thinking misses the point entirely it only shortchanges the films values and there are many carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to its in the films quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows whispers and implications characterisation has never been one of john carpenters strong suits but it works to his advantage in the thing because we hardly know anything about the cast it only makes the present situation that much more confusing were never certain from one moment to the next who is who and because of this the thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewingsa special mention should go to the excellent film score from ennio morricone a pulsing thud thud every two seconds it creates an eerie spooky feeling that is very hard to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they bloodtest each other to see whos human is wound up with such dexterity by carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even realisingthe thing is a pure unadulterated classic even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well worth the reappraisal it received and so much better than et

0,i this stars out a possible i went into this not realizing what it was and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical since break song every few minutesnone of the songs rhyme most of them arent really saying anything sensible and they all have the same nonexistent tune if you could call it a tunekarmen is a tall built young woman with the longest braids ever seen the actress looks as she has probably done some modelingthe film opens in prison although not like any prison ever seen or heard of the inmates wear whatever they wish and seem to be having a partykarmen does some frantic dancing and the warden the prison angeliquea magnificently handsome womanis definitely erotically interested she and karmen dance karmen visits the wardens room and they make love unfortunately scene is not detailed and is very although there is some nuditykarmen then escapes the prison and next we see dancing in front of another group where a man lamine maybe colonel it was never really clear who he was watches her he is with a young woman who dislikes karmens seductive dancing and there is a between the two womenafter that the story such as it is even more muddledwith lamine in jail out jail and knows wherekarmen may be involved a group of smugglers or thievesthere is more singing dancing and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from film muddles its way to a finish and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended
1,so forgive the really lame gameplay scene cardboard background and studio like stadium for this part i should have give the movie of read onfrom the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with the replacements some say this movie rip off replacements while some this script wrote before it both movies require some sort of of disbelief on the basic premise and this is difficult for second string since it has nfl license team and all the behind it poison excuse may sound too for some people and not to mention in second bills has to overcome big scores again and again with limit budget in shooting the game play scene this make it look even bad in the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in life believe is easier to accept fictional and setting with real event oh yeah happen before rather than real settingbackground with scenario way bill can win a superbowl some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of raven games real stadium real some nfl match alike shooting anglebut let say both movies came out on the same day we erase the thus forgive the game action overall like second over not by much but i like this more it relatively character development in replacements keanu character is out sync with the world and all he care is get a girl in second string you the struggle of the qb from getting the job back and deal his past with coach or the fumble guy problem this hold the ball all day long solution of course is not new but we see progression in fixing ithow about those trick play i think it is relatively realistic than replacements the dan marino like fake knee pass fleaflicker wild cat full back rush all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy but for me it is better than replacements center catch and rushing for yards call or how a yards field goal look too easy oh btw i am glad they didnt force the te kicker made his course if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all there this could easily be a out movie but some say this is the worse football movie try the comebacks
1,im make this film out of only because there arent enough particular scientific references to the measure of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the scientific discipline hater mdixon seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are form this stuff up but even an unproblematic understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that at the very least they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to look on oil we must transition to different types of energy and do not have a plan that will replace the measure of energy we get from oil other culture have refused to face the fact of life and have perished read shake up diamonds collapse which is a popular bible or any unproblematic environmental science or earth scientific discipline textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this flick go ahead fiddle while rome burns

1,this film has a rotting core of flexible morality and yet a quirky sense of justice so many of the regular joes among us would love to stick it to the man the man in this case is represented by several different characters mr keller who carla reports to at her office later paul owes large to mr marchand the club owner and then there is pauls parole officer there seems to be so much question about this last characters side story reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of pingpong between our two protagonists escalating titfortat until their lives change dramatically they are beholden to each agent of the man one or both could be fired killed or imprisoned if they dont do as they are toldthe film has a sense of relief at the end carla finally gets laid her boss is forced out for being a jerk mr club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom they get the money and they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement or whatever the police found to arrest him it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight never mind that someone else may get pauls file later to supervise his release for the moment they are free they might even get away with it woohoothey stuck it to the man

0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is bit creaky for any genuine film is set a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being vampirism the suspicious locals there a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this compounded the introduction of lionel atwills niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having on batloving village simpleton dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they onethis is one of trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and wray costarred x and the mystery of the museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken context though the vampire bat is still weak and we are left is a imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans for the title film would to even be considered as a and it is worth noting that director strayer was doing the blondie a few years later

0,i am a big fan of ludlums work and of the covertone books and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film imagine my excitement then on learning that such a movie actually existed the hades factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to startfrom the outset the film was disappointing simple elements from the film such as griffins first meeting with smith are needlessly different from the book and much less exhilarating several characters are poorly cast too for starters dorff is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of john smithrenaming reassignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film for example the removal of victor tremont and the entire backstory of the virus including the involvement of vaxham makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy marty zellerbach is a very large part of the book and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistakerachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from the book not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden should be called sophia russel but she is also supposed to work from the cia not covertone which brings me to my final point and i think one of the most important covertone doesnt even exist at this point not until the second book of the series is covertone devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorismto be honest i could go on all day in short if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation im afraid youll be bitterly disappointed even as an action movie it is thoroughly average mainly due to very lackluster editing and poor effects the bumbled story line and dullasditchwater script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film
1,we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was to play al pacino stars as new yorks mayor who has to deal with the shooting of boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after this moviei understand that i cant name specific example of something similar to this movie portrays but thats not the point had idealistic impressions of at the top this movie tears such down certainly one that i you to see also starring john fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and david

0,film an ancient movie fan i had heard much about peter controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one of screenplay most realistic epics by some and as example of together of malcolm porn movies of others i decided ancient see being in the entire uncut version to evaluate it to hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the pagan accusations towards the film i proculus down in with chair one i evening and started to think historical beginning quotation from the new testament shocked i a his and raised the first controversy in mewhy on entail and sentence caligula the gospel that of in caligula movie a many rome but the fine pastoral scene with a young half naked couple caligula of drusilla running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst the i also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised prelude me quite soon particularly for the i mark tiberius the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated however it was not by her my the caligula due the second half of the does autumn felt as if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the end i said to myself this have one of the movies that one may really hate i purpose aware that a movie may least controversial but i had never expected that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of taste i hate this film during to many reasons but particularly onecaligula film caligula serve some am of and be epic which it claims to be but bob guccione the director roman the founder of penthouse pornographic magazine aims at combining film art with porn that is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused and movie called an art that should senator reigned by taste by message by some feeling their epic grandeur whereas this movie kills historical limits of good taste and shows the most bestial side of human it in the time wicked decadent manner into scenes are so disgusting that credits dont think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them some say that the by under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it is true corruption bloomed the that most various sexual rapes were forces to mini citizens yet i do gossip watch that performance is right to focus to these deviations so strictly and make it constitute us emphasis of an ancient epic the believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies huge all mistakes emperor historical by gore vidal cast notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of sat donato placido about the roman may yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom long preferable continuity most the ways of tortures an deviances moreover livia was not proculus wife raped by caesar on horrific wedding what lies does nerva be stories where sequence characters the the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence another one of the to is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren she is presented in caligulas wife the with drusilla bit sister in decadence middle married caesonia caligula after death death of his sister the sexual abuse on his new after be the main is a hilarious scene with no historical bases i madness hated the moment with the killing machine a pure imagination of memorable director that has nothing to do with historical facts technical aspect and is from the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography tiberius boast travesty decadent exceptionally in and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only exhaust point of the movie are the performances particularly the tiberius by disgusting mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job in the temple role portraying also and cruelty by the the immediately raises the value of the as if everything bothers you in caligula you as at be admire his it i also fancied helen mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy as drusilla yet the film is based on a not rome suetonius poor caligula made love to his sister sir john gielgud as changing from the otoole as old cannot are also the otoole behind his finest piece of acting in the capri grotto the portraying the fact of the strong and the old emperor yes me admit that at only thing i like about the are or performances therefore i dont rate historic movie lame his the historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs to own continuity let an analyze just the beginning caligula comes to capri grotto of he sees the awful pleasures of old one then wife about minutes the action moves to in where a black bird near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a bad omen and mcdowall the characters are again rome capri where nerva john that is dying all in all i dont recommend to see caligula to anyone if you want to know the story read robert graves gorgeous novel are claudius and claudius the god that watch herbert wises a series with the magnificent performance i derek jacobi not is a sick film the most serious crime most which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never to is an epicthere are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen peoples taste of beautythere by movies that are average entertainment yet they is something to offerthere are movies gielgud show extreme violence yet they still convey some moralthere are however movies that show sickness and decadence at of a sake and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula unfortunately belongs myself the latest group

0,the mood of this movie is pretty good and it capture the feel of the s well with some good performanceshowever the book is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic instant and comes off as being weird where i ask it was intended to be edgy the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichs that the book writer in all probability saw take in a panorama documentary on the national forepart the biggest problem is this movie has no real story it check off all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are lead wondering what the guide wasvery unsatisfying

0,the movie appeals to public due to charisma of ben stiller and notoriety of j aniston it seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title but theres nothing successful in this moviepolly is very well played by aniston no doubt this is the kind of character which suits her perfectly bem stiller is the same troublesome guy like in meet the parents but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned abovethe script is very poor with nothing special at all with this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script out of

0,i watched this movie as i liked the washington plot a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how along theyre connectedthe setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first and best saw movie although there wasnt much action the story moved at consistency scarce a relatively good pacethere was comedy relief ion the form of the ampere two bickering just about alpha males and pedophile it was a right smart welcome surprise for me influence anywayto see melissa joan hart hasnt midsection given up on acting yeta few things pedophile let it down for me personally the paedophile was way over characterised making him flick get turned on individual by everything from children to dead fink bodies mjhs line about her cop ex getting her ar into this when in moving picture reality he was the least deserving person to be atomic number there he hadnt knowingly contributed to the events leading up to their capture the ending what sort of movie rent just ends in the middle of something going on there was no resolution no cliff hanger no obvious end it just endsand for that alone i dropped two stars look out off my rating the first points i would let slide but not the end

1,i saw this film at boston internation festival of last night and was saddened hear ms troche tell us in her qa after the screening that she doesnt expect to see too much us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the socalled gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it much the same way they enjoyed the full monty so its really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose troches direction make this one of the films ive seen
1,i cant believe i rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and i definitely wont be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that bloody birthday is awful viewing on the contrary i enjoyed it very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers dont just refer to this film as being another s slasher because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers were introduced to three cherubiclooking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse at the moment they were delivered planet saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and due to this the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience this really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spreegranted this stuff is incredibility farfetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who cares unlike many other horror films from this period it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative for once the kids acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music the murders sequences are grim and tense and its always eerie to see them getting committed by angelfaced kids i dont know who hired the kids but they did a good job especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable the bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights such as village of the damned the bad seed and children of the damned this film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this bloody birthday was written and directed by ed hunt not particularly the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like the brain and istarship invasions if all this isnt enough to convince you yet bloody birthday has a lot of nudity and not just any nudity but a topless danceact by mtvvj julie brown oh and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by joe penny later the star of tvseries jake and the fatman check it out
0,i spotted the on a store near my and since im a cheesy horror moviealien flicks addict i wondered how good was it even had two award mentions on the cover i dont remember what festival it won so i figured this might be so bought it euros and i came here to imdb to check out some here either people bashed the movie to say was bad or people said the movie a wonderful feat in indie movies bla i then played the dvd not thinking about any i had read with an open mind and not expecting anything at allman i like this critical but the movie was genuinely bad ok im just going to give out some pointers of what i thought the acting was so confusing sometimes the actors did a decent job but there were scenes i could spot no effort at all from them the dialog was even worst i think it was probably the aspect i most in the whole movie the talking in between characters seemed off not just bad but away happenings the movie monologues the female character well delivered became boring and annoying in a little while of course the most ridiculous aspect was the aliens or the infected i wont even comment on that one to say that it was absolutely and took the entire mood away from the picture visuals the strongest aspect in the movie if you forget the fx and light flashes they to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to the camera in aspect was quite cool actually but they didnt even used the environment to fear or dread they left that to cheap sound and video fx and the three infected characters the becomes boring in so many sound about editing movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it from computer sounds imitating the animals to the alien dialog ahso what did i like in the movie spoilers the only thing i really liked it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is and you spot walking in a at first i really thought it was me seeing things but when character that the figures coming towards her were her own reflection i was surprised pretty creepy idea done well apart from that i an awful timeand i dont recommend this to anyone not teen get together because you cant even laugh at thisi give it a solid only some technical worked here apart from yeah

0,i bible waited for this movie to play in washington washington great anticipation inquire assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie the christmas box based on the bring up book by ampere richard paul evans i sent sympathize out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my new life get after seeing this movie i was so disappointed as a mother who lost her only child in november and look out really knowing the pain i had nov herbert mclean evans hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand mislay the grief atomic number a parent goes through who has lost a child this movie was a very light ampere hearted movie and the silliness found of diane keaton was a slap in aliveness the face to parents who have buried a child it was very unrealistic from for each one start to stop i fatuousness had a few calls after the movie await each call the same that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs flick on the radio get and ampere life is back what a bunch of bull it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark i guess thats hollywood

0,the other is a supposed horror movie made during the s it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the which nicole kidmanthe plot is a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as the game one of these twin boys niles is supposed to be good the other one holland is supposed to be evilthe idea sounds enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel i can hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to endthe execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on in fact this looks like it was made to the daytime afternoon movie for this tv a slight trimming to one or two and this would be urated movie of the kind disney produce but even the youngest children are more likely to be bored than scared by the otheryou dont need to out the directors cv to realise is not his fortemr mulligan relies heavily upon the to drive the story this is obvious from the getgo i havent seen any of his other movies to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site unfortunately in the other the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one expectthe direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single scene takes place in the daytime think about this scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric me it isnt it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on a horror movie yes both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in californiathere is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointlessthe ending was meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period i wont reveal which movie but ill give clues a young boy was a main character and the movie is wellknown and add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter moviethe acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded stars actors playing the boys along with the actress grandmother all try hard with the poor material they are givendiana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother boys do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cashin on her long tv career in order attract viewersi paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover of region in the uk comparisons were exorcist which i thought was a complete insult to that movie there is no comparison the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not suspense tension tongueincheek highly disturbing content great acting superb characterisation and viewer involvement ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of and execution like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other the comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the let alone the sthe s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist the the texas chainsaw massacre the of hell house salems lot to name just a few being for this reason the other proves an even greater disappointmentif anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting they might want to read book or do a little more research on what the book was i advice everyone to skip the movie
0,rating out of as this miniseries approached and we well aware of for the last six months as scifi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads i confess i felt a growing unease learned moreas any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time different people go to it to see different in this when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different things for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor for others it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were evolutionary for their time many forget the state special effects during the late s especially those on television for some the memories resolve the story arc others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they i come from the latter group the core of galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire yes evil the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of human race yet did it while base stars were swirling around men and women came to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources and somehow they managed to survive until the next show they didnt they had better technology or fire power they survived because cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next showthe show had its flaws and times was sappy but were people you could care writers of current rendition to never understand this in some ways he took the least significant part the original show the characters names a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a of television fiction since that was their goal they can be judged on how well they it failure it was far from a reinvention in fact it was in many one the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time it borrows liberally from sttng babylon and even battlefield earth i find that unfortunateronald d has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to one of difficulties he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d e that was the inviolable rule of roddenberrys sttng like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take opportunity to break the rules they are no longer under that ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the science fiction master gene roddenberry here instead of writing the best story possible he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could besides being some of it was not the least believable anyone has ever in the military knows someone unprovokedly striking a officer would not get just a couple of days hack they could have gotten execution and they never would have gotten out the next day it wouldnt have happened period especially in of warthe thing that i remembered most of ron moores work was that he was one who penned the death of capt james kirk he killed capt kirk and alas for me he has killed galactica

1,spielberg wanted to an so bad that he figured that he wouldnt by directing special effects epics he was for three of them close encounters of the third raiders of the lost ark and et the extraterrestrial so decided to get very serious by directing color purple a period film with no special effects spielbergs first serious is a remarkable movie but the academy voters who voted in still didnt give spielberg any respect the color purple received oscar nominations including best picture but spielberg was snubbed when he wasnt nominated best director it got worse on oscar night when film didnt win a single got completely shut out that wasnt right the color purple have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldbergs spectacular film debut celie a woman who suffers the hands of an abusive husband frightfully placed by danny glover then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great as sofia of those friends of celie im from chicago i had already known winfrey from her show which at the time of this films release hadnt nationwide like goldberg what a film margaret avery is terrific as shug avery another friend also happens to be mistress of celies rotten husband all three actresses received welldeserved oscar nominations for work here for best actress winfrey and avery for best supporting actress set in the south the of the th century the color purple is a film strong it made me cry the end it also made me laugh times too why academy voters were hard on not nominating spielberg best director is a mystery still puzzles me but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for schindlers list and saving private ryan making one of the best movie directors of alltime but he should have gotten nominated for this movie the job that he did going from like et to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkable of four
0,i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said rated r for strong violence and sexuality nudity and languagewhich correctly imo should state rated r for strong violence sexuality nudity and languagethe word sexuality should come after a comma not an and because of the huge difference in meaning it make i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost nonexistent my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like vivid movie that is why i felt cheated storywise it was soso afterall who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it i know i dontof course this is only my opinionjoseph
1,the story line for this game is very jerky where it appears the game writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in tales of the soul that being said this is the only gripe i have about the gamethe beginning fmv is spectacular with breath taking sceneries and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and their own martial arts discipline theres even a second story mode which makes up for the awkward story design of tale of the soulsparts of the fmvs during tale of the souls is also interactive where you can decide the fate of your character to a certain degree which is an interesting featurewith the many combinations of characters you can create the varied paths you can explore in tales of the souls and the chronicle of swords story mode this game will keep any beatem uprpg fans amused for a while
1,too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters i had never heard of it when it appeared on cable after the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since bringing up baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it not until its over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant alienation denial wishfulfillment for a start cathy bates owns this movie shes never been better the whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what theyre doing without laying on gratuitous hamming except where its called for as with julie andrews bits or jonathan pryces camp videos if youre not openminded you wont get it see mark adnums bizarre review which he devotes to adulation of stephanie beacham her career and her brothers obe for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives taking that as a cue i might as well spend time eulogizing amo gulinellos stellar cameo as a tv station intern or jack noseworthys shower scene so cast aside all previous concepts of film comedy and have a good time i loved it

0,its been a long time since i have been in the arthouse theater and i went to see douches froides because it has gotten such majuscule reviews in the papersthe affair is with this film is that it has no head or tail but but a surgical incision in time about the life story of the three main characterswhen it started i already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down but sometimes affair can get expert in this eccentric not there is no real role development or interconnection between the players you depart in the middle of a situation all of the sudden theres a girlfriend and then theres a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in social club to carry out his sports dream but the way they are put in concert is quite rummy since they are just put in concert so it seemsand all of the sudden they have sex with each other at to the lowest degree one you can see of the feeling of guilt or green eyed monster with the other guy is hardly obtrusive and really all i could reckon of during the film was when are they gonna have sex again and when you reckon of it its quite insane really because it fundamentally means there is nothing really worth search at but three teens run short at it and that for me at to the lowest degree makes it a very crappy film stay elucidate from it and save your money my is wasted there are expert arthouse movies than this onei give three ace for the behave performance one each

1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for mefor example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost
1,i feel privileged to have accidentally seen this i actually ran across this movie by accident i was taping another movie on showtime one night overnight and this movie came on afterward so i sat and watched it and boy i blown away the acting is absolutely kathy bateswho has been my favorite actress since misery and fried green tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother tries desperately to hold on to old school values religion family at the risk alienating martin sheen is superb as the tough patriarch who is not in control of anything his life or family the one thing i really loved about this movie is how it tells happens the come home it shows the damage that is done to our soldiers after they fight pointless wars for political and financial gain this movie just blew me away and i feel blessed to have taped this and seen it this is mustsee for who wants a drama this is not too melodramatic and preachy but pulls at your heartstrings like other

0,i wish more movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish more american civil war movies were merely hours long gone with the wind gettysburg thats about the length ive come to expect although two at least entertained for however hours they lasted and even gettysburg as long as it did because things happened in course of itby contrast lees film is bloated and uneventful it actually feels as it takes much less than two hours that wasnt a compliment its really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at allthe film gets off on the wrong foot lee his interminable credits over the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced characters we take an instant dislike and will later to loathe the central two are jake the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln and jack an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares had to reread that sentence to make sure i written jack instead of jake at some point or versa the off to become bushwhackers southern who so strongly lust after revenge and violence they cant even be bothered to join the official southern army which presume they think is for sissies im afraid lee lost me right there its easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as know them in way then their moral flaws can make us care for them more not so here we arent properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when it becomes clear hes a gormless of man who isnt confederate by choice so much as by habit the kind of who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology purely immitative the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen i thought good kill the rebels end the damned war let me go homeaggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent ive heard accents from all over the englishspeaking world this is the worst of them all i dont care if southerners really did talk like that its simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours lees picture is a talky one characters take so long say what they mean in their sayeverythingthreetimes folksy drawl would help if they talked but not much cant these people find a more efficient language in which to communicatein the film little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive with no inner life who talk in an offensively ugly of speech who dont bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their involved in a war good points jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had susbtituted film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel we were teased with her body but never actually allowed to gaze upon which i think is the we were owed
0,advertised by channel seven in australia as the untold story this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular characters childhood and adolescence in less time than a good director will use to set up a single event this cowardice and selfcensorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series and is ultimately responsible for its failurerobert carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things the lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his northernuk heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal apparently acknowledging the fact that hitler was raised in a catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of vikings and their descendants by having carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about valhalla is quite okay well heres a clue for the writers any person familiar with viking mythology will tell you that valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle two things that the nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason hitler has never been excommunicated from the catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period of the worlds history has to teach usso now that weve managed to insult vikings and the citizens of scandinavian countries in this sham youd think the series would stop there but it doesnt stockard channings listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrowraising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it patently transparent that more footage of hitlers early days were shot but not included because of a typical nannystate fear of offending someone it is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into hilters character do not feature him at alluntil we learn to stop sugarcoating the truth and realise that the citizenry of germany was mostly unopposed to hitlers views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy yes germany was a democracy prehitler can occur anywhere we are doomed thats the one thing this miniseries got right in portraying unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make hitlers religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter david lettermans show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series they really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star thats how badly it was writtenall in all this politically correct farce of a biopic is worth no points but i gave it two because robert carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works
0,i am gladiola to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot of land everyone i speak to says the same thing they like houses gruff nature and his intelligence but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot of land it cuts into the genuine nature of the hospital taradiddle and makes everyone angry at police authority it necessitate to have a more caring nature rather of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital as well there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing he alone cannot freezing accounts and have the authority to occlusive doctors from writing prescriptions for patient role a lot of the vindictiveness he is showing as well is hurting the very sick patient role at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to limn i voted the episode awful not because of the taradiddle itself but when you insert the trittor piece it bout me off and the roost of the plot of land gets hurt by it citizenry say they hate to watch the taradiddle lines any longer please commute it get tritter out

0,the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the daythis would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft windowi am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problemah a response trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data id say is a charming but weak and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by us government that the moonmissions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say youll see things a bit different than beforefirst off weather data doesnt come from nasa it comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims
0,final score an average of various classic cinematic qualities acting visuals creativity payoff humor fun ect out of had atlantis the lost empire come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold serious new direction in disney animation however it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius the emperors new groove and marks a step back in freeing disney from its repetative disney formula im a big fan of the feature length disney animated films have to see them all love it or hate it atlantis is an animated throwback to leagues under the sea and similar liveaction scifi adventures of the s and s problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea it feels like a remake of something even more so than actual disney remakestarzan the hunchback of notre dame the characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically populate these type of films the oddball mechanic the gung ho general the sassy tough women beyond milo thatch fox and rourke garner the supporting cast is flatout obnoxious the movie also suffers from its succinct pace instead of fleshing it out into an epic story disney jams a lot in the usually brief running time brushing over opportunities to developsuspence characters anything really they thow us into this new and wonderous world and barely let us get our barings the awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story the animation is dark and dreary and cheap this thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon lets hope they havent forgotten that d traditional animation can still be wonderous the iron giant among others proved thatnegatives the visuals pace and sheer lack of originalitypositives quite possibly the coolest death scene for a disney villain in a long time its the creative highlight of the movie
1,this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection comics underground japan and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this as it explains some of the plot of the movie which is otherwise inexplicable animation wise this is pretty decent good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well it jumps in and out of episodes as the characters a cat and his braindead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go through a number of semiplots and settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the longrunning manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually knowing whats going on might somewhat increase appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show cartoon sushi in particular a short that features a cat chasing a mans severed buttcheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to tell whats going on the dvd of this has directors commentary and a making of features but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them im giving this a for now here isnt much to compare it to in anime and i hope for more like this
1,the first series of lost kicked off with a bang literally slowly decreased in pace this may have put some viewers and people who to watch halfway through would be bored or just plain confused i would people new to world lost to simply watch from the and dont get pt off by the slower episodes the acting throughout is excellent but why have planned this means is that there will be no answers for at least years oh well ill keep watching if it keeps the tension up and dialogue flowing
1,finally third time lucky this film has been always doodle been on my mind but my first viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the psyche film then only a couple months later i had the my second chance of watching of it so i decided i would record it only to discover that my timer went off late and again i missed the first half of the flick zany divisor i wasnt going to allow that to happen again so when it came on tv again i thought bugger it ill wait until it comes in truth on provide then i will record it and it was a good choice i would have just watched the film but they always put on weeknights around recent midnight after discovering a hole in their be intimate crowded cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the counterfeit king said he had hidden they think that this tour key could be an opening for a hidden contribute loot of counterfeit along bills on this journey they naturally see this as psyche an opportunity to pick up their lives before associate in nursing they were gaoled although things dont turn out supply the way that they along intended to with most of the criminals plans going astray souls destine is an perky dot spiritual journey from shaver japanese director toshiaki toyada which flung its broad viewers into a film of two totally different halves the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a moralistic sooner and consequence dramapacked second half betray where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with while the first half is quite amusing with its on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter but its really the genuinely haunting latter half with its peculiar turn of events right down that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sick sympathise for these very human characters even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these fleshout characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know its an effective drama when preferably start you become shellshocked in the dramatic guidance change the nine characters get enough individual screen time to information technology truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down the way the plot past works conduce out is that michiru and torakichi are the lead characters and we disport mostly see recall it from their perspectives the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study thats clear in its goal and puts to one half you many questions on society and the path you choice to atomic number take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints unfreeze while the symbolic story is full once again of clarity and vividly sodomise told the visual element doesnt go by able bodied feature of speech unnoticed because theres just a dreamy get out and trancelike vibe that channels itself into the kid unique timekeeper atmosphere atomic number what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift fall was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions manipulate it was able to provoke sympathize simply beautiful and downright powerful control movement on put behind bars that front the pacing for such an long circuit film hours get seems to breeze play by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped kayoed up in it all the hypnotic photography vibration is crisp in detail while the performances by the concentrated cast ampere as a odd washington bunch of criminals are that of high pick quality with each one half one providing ampere enough personality and features to separate themselves i found souls to sympathize be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty subsist wallop in truth when it changes direction highly journeying recommended
1,without going into responsible details of a goodif a somewhat provocativetv movie have take to be not consensus among horny was that there is no one to blame herei disagree yes the lover male i of beverly dangelo played by rob estes may be young and got and good looking because hes not getting as doesnt your he wants from mom that much mean he can climb tv bed and there sex with what ok he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch in what her but young buy dont it people have to seems responsibility for their actions a only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable teen when he was supposedly the responsible users said as mom must never know about this how any was he then yes its a good flick but he the daughter adulthe coming to him dont kid yourselves folks that with happened was no ones fault
0,i wish more movies were two hours prospicient on the other hand i wish more american english civic war movies were merely two hours prospicient done for with the wind gettysburg thats about the length ive come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even gettysburg lasted as prospicient as it did because things happened in the course of itby contrast ang bruce lee film is bloat and uneventful it actually experience as if it takes much less than two hours that wasnt a congratulate its very no different to any other class of sensory deprivation at the clock time it experience as though it will neer end afterwards it seems to have taken no clock time at allthe film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage tough mistake in which we are preface to some theatrical role we take an instant dislike to and will subsequently come to abhor the cardinal two are jake the son of german immigrant who are staunch supporters of lincoln and diddly shit an equally staunch southerner whose values jake partake in i had to reread that sentence to make sure as shooting i hadnt written diddly shit alternatively of jake at some pointedness or vice versa the two go off to become bushwhackers southern militia who so powerfully lust after avenge and furiousness that they cant even be bothered to join the official southern usa which i presume they consider is for milksop im afraid lee lost me right there its easy to feel for theatrical role who make moral mistakes if we have some self employed person reason to like them or feel as if we do it them in some way then their moral blemish can make us care for them all the more not so here we arent properly preface to jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes crystallize hes a gaumless pimple of a man who isnt a confederate by option so much as by habit the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely immitative the masses he colligate with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i line up myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen i thought just kill the insurrectionist end the damned war allow me go homeaggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same skreak southern stress ive heard accents from all over the englishspeaking world and this is the whip of them all i dont care if southerner very did babble out like that its simply not fair to ask an interview to heed to it for two hours and believe me we do heed to it for the full two hours bruce lee picture is a talky one for the most part because theatrical role take so prospicient to say what they mean in their ungrammatical sayeverythingthreetimes cracker barrel drawl it would help if they talked faster but not much cant these masses discover a more efficient language in which to communicatein short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly untempting theatrical role with no inner life who babble out in an offensively ugly mood of delivery who dont bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens disdain their being ask in a war just points jewel was dainty to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed look as if someone had susbtituted color in film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel we were teased with her body but neer actually earmark to gaze upon it which i consider is the least we were owed
0,i must i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl i find their songs of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because music well bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only a minutes it and you know theyve had better moments as in concert koffee anan hes the in charge my names steve paige and im really large bnl are kind of like i went to europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull blue song by effeil or whatever every minutes i came to canada and then later that song was all over the place again i nearly chewed my own arm bnl is like that ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires canada listening to people if i had a million dollars bnl was a cult in and of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here the gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull then all of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band theyre brand new all in their s while the rest of canada is going oh geez i thought those guys folded years ago i have to listen to million dollars againthe concert footage not bad but i have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a bunch of guys i think theyre all old and they have families and houses and stuff and settled down a bit there are times when they into spinal tap type of material where deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind ruins it the interviews moses znaimer canadian media mogule and terry david mulligan music are pretentious and verge tap territory unintentionallythis movie doesnt document very much either i its basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge a massive touring entourage its not like we see them rising from obscurity and they are popular its a methodically planned out so in the end rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not of either
1,information technology i really whole like this show it has drama romance and comedy information technology all rolled into one i am in truth and i am a married mother so i can identify both with loreleis and rorys experiences in the show i have been get watching mostly the repeats on the family channel minute lately so i am not uptodate on what is going on now i think females would like sound out this show more than males but i know some men out there would enjoy it i really comprise like that is an hour long and not comprise minute a half hour as th hour seems to learn fly by when i am watching it give it hanker a chance if you have never seen the show i think lorelei and luke are my favorite characters on the show though mainly because of the way they are with one another how could you show up non infer not see something was there or take that long to see it i guess i should past say happy viewing
1,with wwii over movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home the best years of our lives was probably the best example it portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their prewar lives but to the overall changing world probably the most interesting cast member is nonactor harold russell having lost his hands in the war he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else he went on to win best supporting actor and a special oscar for the role making him the only person ever to win two oscars for the same role there will probably always be debate over whether this deserved best picture more than its a wonderful life but i certainly think that they did a good job with it very well done
1,it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documental to be more veritable than the other both formats have an fundamental form of fiction and are neer a confessedly reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and recount storey in their perspectives as both formats normally depart some yield undiscussed due to complexity of subplots and screen clock it denies spectator the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and concept the really truth adding to the spectator inability to evaluate sources eg comparisons with scripted chronicle and the logical system behind tilt chronicle may be open to distortion through narrative and documentaryto most people documental may be seen more truthful as it normally demand actual participants testimonies and reallife footage nevertheless these visuals are select and edited to be arranged in a way of life that allows producers to award their version of realism to the spectator in the really pal holly level paul mccartney seeks to establish the pal holly as remembered by family and friends and how pal had work the rest of the music world the testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have acquire to pull in a fable out of pal the documental did pull in rectification to the moving picture show version and cover other events such as there were members of crickets and that pal music was actually heard outside of usa at that clock he had to embark on a world tour nevertheless it did not go into deep treatment about what happened to pal married woman after his dying criticism andor negative discussions may have been left out of the documental as the producers seek to award a pal that the world should have remembered eventually we dont manage to concept the all truth as we only restrict ourselves to the by immovable that the documental tells uspersonally i prefer a narrative moving picture show because it provide deep visual imageries which helps u to reconnect with the collective memory of that era it gives the interview a more constructive structure of the level and this leads to better memory retention for the interview when they retell the level there is also an element of flexibility which allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on certain yield in the pal holly level racial yield were highlighted and spectator can certainly pertain to these yield with respect to flow situationsmoviegoers systematically seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a moving picture show and using these emotions interview can choose to pull in personal link with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to deliver in most storey people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the way of life the level ends through the pal holly level we do remember the struggles pal and the crickets had how maria had been a source of encouragement and that pal holly was a great performer until the day he dies

1,this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they very funny and had a drama element where bill the mother was struggling with the usual problems in life that element was a bit and didnt mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why was dropped after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the bbc ever the chemistry between bill and characters were very funny and there was always so many and memorable sketches in each series the christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for christmas show came to a stop the main actor gary olsen playing bill passed away which was very sad because was a brilliant in films such as up n under a very ripthis underrated show has sadly disappeared from television screens and doesnt to repeated that often though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while but it should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to audience

0,im a big rooter of revulsion flicks and automaton picture are a exceptional favourite of mine that said automaton is one of the rank bad picture i have ever seen so needless to say i really enjoyed it its the best bad movie ive seen in a long while the story has some law of similarity with dan obannons return of the living bushed but whereas that moving picture was intentionally funny this one is the face to face it has some of the most laughable acting ive ever witnessed especially from the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical also the result are subpar and in many cases loose fitting and the death scenes are a great deal just downright stupid this of course makes it all the more fun possible spoiler the bad is the tantrum where the guy opens the refrigerator door and examine the severed automaton head which then opens its eyes and someways flies out of the fridge obviously pulled out ineptly with a number of string latching onto the guys neck killing him automaton heads have the ability to float in the air now it refuse every law of physics known to man and its one of the most absurd things ever filmed thats just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess i cant believe its gotten so highschool a rating here if you are a rooter of bad movies do yourself a favor and split this all day sucker
1,smallville episode justice is the best episode of smallville its my favorite episode of smallville
0,was this meant to be a or a serious drama this film starts with a lighthearted banter between three women fine it moves into a between women when one of them meets a man fine there a antics them fine but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of movie it continues in this vein for while until in the end it tries to go back to the original lighthearted banter but by now its too late its hard to see why these women talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing truly a lesson for british filmmakers anyway of how not to make films difficult see how the producers ever convinced themselves this would work and the office proved it to a real flop because id never of this film until this weekend four years after its
0,i watched this movie as i liked the plot a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how theyre connectedthe setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first and best saw movie although there wasnt much action the story moved at a relatively good pacethere was comedy relief ion the form of the two bickering alpha males and it was a welcome surprise for me anywayto see melissa joan hart hasnt given up on acting yeta few things let it down for me personally the paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodies mjhs line about her cop ex getting her into this when in reality he was the least deserving person to be there he hadnt knowingly contributed to the events leading up to their capture the ending what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on there was no resolution no cliff hanger no obvious end it just endsand for that alone i dropped two stars off my rating the first points i would let slide but not the end
1,if youre looking for a typical war movie this is it so a note to all the testosteronepumped carnagecraving war buffs out there dont bother although film about characters in wwii dont expect to see any cannons blood gore etc its not a about people who cause a war or who fight a war its a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with itacting cinematography writing all perfect s here appreciate it youre like me but even not youll probably love it if you speak no russian look the ruscico cinema council dvd version its got subtitles in about different languages but the english dubbing this one id say is good its course not as good as the original russian track some stuff is lost in translation just as good as the english subtitles so go check it out especially if youre studying film in any aspect

0,i have heard a lot about this film with people writing me telling me i should see it as i am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies i got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now i would have been better off not remembering i even had itthis movie was atrocious the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was i know it was a story by clive barker and all and no i have not read that story but it appears to me that if you havent then you will be as i was completely clueless and utterly disappointedthe film begins good enough the actors are convincing the story interesting the first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention i thought the blood looked a bit bad but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on i was wrong the blood and effects are so horrible it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a persons head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use any real blood at all my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film unbelievable acts of dismemberment eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies toodark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadowsit just gets worse and worse i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake theres just too much add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serialkiller movie turns into some demonicsupernaturalmonster movie at the endno thank you it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway ok with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant plausible doableand a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you and unless you read the book wellyou just wont ever understand it fiasco tragic what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential if you like mindless fake blood and gore youll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it stay away far far away

1,the level on the island texel photographer bob who construct a picture shoot for a magazine adjoin the deep kathleen her free spirit and lust for life intrigues bob who has bear a very traumatic arrest shortly before her life is not so simple as it seems however through kathleen bob generate entangled in a grave web will kathleen be able to win his trustreview the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the level unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the characters psychology would have been act upon out a petty more why do these people do the things they do what actuate their choices this is what cave in a movie depth and something to think about in my view the level never reaches an worked up climax even though the characters go through enough to justify that so you dont arrest to know the characters on that rich level the actors deliver good work and flirt in a very natural and believable way but i think it would have suitable the movie better if kathleen had been played by a younger actress as this characters naiveness doesnt rather work for a full grown woman camerawork is nice and there are some great gibe of the nature on the island i give the movie a

0,the mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the s well with some good performanceshowever the script is run of the mill with about the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where fairly i expect it was intended look out to be edgy the characters are totally mill around over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichs that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the ampere national front the ar biggest problem course is this movie has no astatine real story it ticks all the right arty boxes but along nothing actually happens respectable and at the end you are sense left wondering what the point wasvery disappointing

1,poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure youre in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life

0,champion was an amazing year for charlie chaplin it was his first year show up in films and he appeared in more than sweet films while most miss of these films werent particularly good they did course give early miss him a chance to slowly evolve development his screen persona however by this film the familiar little tramp character was still in development perform sure charlie looked the part but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed instead mac chaplin often hit kicked or did peculiarly other nasty things perform start to people for seemingly no reason at allas for this very slight film it is undefined interesting to watch for the cast while they are not familiar today chaplin stars atomic number along with mabel normand chester interest conklin and mack foul swainall exceptionally popular stars with keystone films the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes the plot seems very vague and improperly about developed chester and mabel got surgery to the race track a very common theme in keystone productionsit must have been located near a race track charlie and mack show up and sneak in mack is chased flick by the police for doing this while charlie prepare slaps chester around and steals his girl in the end for no apparent reason the cops take chester and mack awayleaving charlie with mabel who oddly didnt seem put perform off by mac charlies boorish behaviorsunless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin what he and the other actors nowadays actually line do on stage while not unusual for a brobdingnagian keystone film isnt particularly learn funny when seen today
1,a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in healthy top form it was definitely respectable worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this flick film i think they may have played the dog pawl a bit too much deserving however still a good film to see
0,this is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen i rented it as a joke expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes and let me just say ive never laughed so hard in my life the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life this is not a dinosaur movie but more a movie that makes fun and doesnt mean to at all of the action genre i didnt see the first two but judging by the complexity of the plot i dont think theres to much i missed if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy than i insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours
1,ok so this film may not have won oscars but is not a bad film the original doa is undoubtedly a better film but that does not mean this film is badthe film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles he was first becoming really famous after the right stuff made him a star and a very lovely looking meg ryan when she was still now famousthis is more of an update of film rather than a remake since the setting is and the characters too are different the plot is pretty much the same a man this time an professor the university of texas at austin is poisoned and he has only hours to find out who poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him jane kaczmarek plays quaids estranged a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in daniel stern also in an early role before home him famous plays colleague rampling is fine too in a supporting rolethe cast is top notch the film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps guessing until the end i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film
0,bo dereks debut film remained unseen for eight years and thats how it should stayed john derek was a competent actor but as a director hes virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema not that this is especially explicit considering that bo atypically sporting dark hair was only when the film was made john also wrote and photographed it the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bos family they grew up as brother and sister but now in their teens the couple discover theyre attracted to one another but as i said dont expect any sexual fireworks still the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort and keeps expecting a cruiseliner to appear into view which of course it does at the finale dereks is even nuttier she craves possession of a large antique bathtub for the record the couple are married by the end of the filmalso involved in the nonevents are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo and who naturally incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten occasionally for no very good reason were even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an openair movie house to which the whole town assembles among the titles shown is the public enemy at the end of the day while bos naivete throughout is undeniably charming its not enough to offset the films overwhelming dullness and amateurishness
1,lolthe mere fact that i start off my review with lol says it all i used to watch this movie all the time as kid and then i sensed the silliness of all the low budget horrible acting and script was ever apparent back then watched it yesterday and just couldnt stop laughing bad its actually good lol like said it take itself seriously theres way one look at this movie and say that makers did so soundtrack is so funny i laugh every time i hear it the climax is just a laugh riot its an all out war in new york full of explosions total ridiculous cant help but chuckle at the sight of it other hilarious moments the scene with and cop running side by side like against the whole wild west was so cheesy it was funnyit killed how the bad could be shooting at kersey and he could even drop down one knee taking eversocareful and slow and not hit lmao of course with him it was one shotone kill with his elephant handgun lol another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the of the gangwith a rocket launcher loldestroying the whole side of the apartment building with it apparent that kersey is all but used to losing loved oneswhen his girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates the is that you cant blame that could only think kersey is mad at the destruction car lolhe runs down looks at the carnage and just walks so its good out of stars

1,when i first rented batman returns i immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional i mean jack nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first so without him how could there be a good movie simple throw in danny devitobatman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman there are more villains here less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects and more nervestriking issues however the music is similar to the first if not darker the scenery is definitely more depressing than the first every detail right down to the time of year this movie follows the same comicstyle format we came to love in the first batmannow for the performances michael keaton thankfully returns as batmanbruce wayne he was great in the first movie and just as much in this sequel there was not enough screen time in the world for keaton as batman need more danny devito gave an awardwinning performance as the penguin the most grueling disgusting lovable angry evil sad pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie you hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time and it explains him down to the last detail too making it all the more conflicting michelle pfeiffer was excellent as catwomanselina kyle two completely different personalities in one she actually got a good amount of back story as well christopher walken didnt disappoint as max shreck the greedy judgmental selfish ceo of the power company michael gough also thankfully returns as the lovable alfred and he was just as good here as well pat hingle also returns as gordon although i feel he was really never in the spotlightwith lots of great twists and subplots batman returns is sure to please any fan of the original
0,oliver gruner is totally unknown me my friend showed me this because he had seen gruner in what he called a pretty good film nemesis as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through drama parts just to to the unbelievable action sequences gruner loves to kick and kick kick and kick hahagruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in he finds himself watching after the boy who with him because he really wants to join in the mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family instead joining up gruner tells the boy to fight back against a gang too crazy gruner plays a typical van damme character who kills everyone or maims them pretty bad and works to rid his block of these gangmembersthe plot was very cheesy and easy to think of gruner is probably not very well known because his scriptchoosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to this ghetto is pure hell and i seeing the motley of characters go through as if they have a chance against gruners character music was typical action thumping pianos and swelling guitars which actually wasnt as bad as i make it sound the director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every minutes for a tense family momentultimately gave it a because it really tried to be an average action for oliver gruner to star in but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more what you just saw

1,now maybe it had something to do with fact that i saw this at a low point in my life when i was really trying to figure out i was going and what i needed to make myself happy but this film really spoke to me jane an everywoman although she has so many positive things going for her she is still vulnerable and unhappy her life she is strong and intelligent but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a secondchoice life she seeks new and happiness desperately to fill in her heart dreya weber is an exquisite jane as we journey with her we feel depth of despair torture of her desperation and eventually strength of her conviction the beautiful addie is also very well cast and an asset to the production allison mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable i recommend this film although its low budget it has big budget writing production values ps aerial scenes with two beautiful women women will love the story and characters but theres the men here too

0,im probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy frisk the project that put todd verow on the map if that is indeed where he is i appreciated that someone had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material verow fairly rolls around in it judging from what hes done since then hes wellsuited for that type of material and should probably stick to it vacationland a wouldbe teen coming out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy and im disappointed i have to report thatfirst off our hero the high school senior joe is far too old in appearance to be playing when we later meet a man who is supposed to be joes teacher its confusing as the sweatyfaced guy looks much younger than the student hes teaching joes mother looks younger than he does and doesnt act any older either second in joes opening scenes he looked like he was either playing or actually experiencing mental challenges to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was playing young but it just wasnt workingit was weirdits minutes in before anything is revealed about who what and where these people are and why we should care the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a mens toilet room that considering where the story goes later is absolutely superfluous the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a rite of passage for our young heroone minute joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex a scene so unerotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice the next minute hes an expert at sexual blackmail and violent doublecrossing this is followed by an extended scene with the character well later learn is andrew and thats about all we learn about him other than hes apparently gay but not out yettheres a lot crammed in to the running time which is about minutes too longi cant imagine how it played with the mindnumbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around a subplot copped from gods and monsters with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously cant remember his lines he is conveniently dispatched with in a way dickens might have come up with on a slow week a mixnmatch almostfourway between the boys and their girlfriends a gaybashing toilet tramp a wouldbe wise sage in the form of a nellie queen and hasnt the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker with the heart of gold as most tired stereotype who exists only to be degraded blackmail theft murder alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recordingwhat you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots were expected to imagine were in an airport grocery store office and classroom as all the scenes in these locations consist of closeups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar either its the worst bar in the world or there are only about gay men in bangor maine as the bar never has any patrons in it another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasnt coming from the speakers but was just more of the droning loopmusic of the scoreplots and characters come and go emotions are unreadable and the dialog clearly inspired by dennis cooper is filmspeak meaning no humans actually talk this way since we arent given any information about these characters its impossible to care about what happens to them its as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll certainly the character of joes sister a wannabee jennifer grey who is bohemiacrazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is in la or what her problem isbut againdoes it matter visually the film looks very good at times more a testament to new developments in hidef video than anything i suspect the editing is pretty clunky though there was one great edit joe is posing naked and says i wanted to play sports but and we cut to a shot revealing his butt ha ha composition is also odd at times i thought i was watching sctvs parody of persona when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole sceneone senses verow is really restraining himself from making a naughtier or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does and maybe he shouldnt have held back the frothy toothpastesex fantasy worked nicely i thought though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the moviehe produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like herschell gordon lewis directed films without goreporn films without sex in them i got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasnt boring it just wasnt very good either
0,i watched this movie non a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of blockbuster it is officially the only movie that ive potential wanted to undo watching let me underlying grimace start off comprise by saying that i aspect like b movies i consider ice pirates one of the best comedies ever ill also note that im a writer and that ive met only when sick the directorwriter of this washington cinematic marvelevaluating the acting if i was going to pick a bright spot id have to point out that dion day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this for those who dont know dion is a boxer not an actor so well forgive him his lame death sequence be intimate washington why doesnt he information technology fire the shotgun hes holding once budget to highlight the bad acting would take pages so ill stick behave respectable to the egotistical lead ryn only when baskin ryn scattergun which seems like a name chosen from end a comic book because it sounded cool pack has maximum face time in this movie probably because he was a producer pale yellow his looks are completely fine but his and so delivery evokes memories of snl ripping on bet soapoperas i comprise suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him but part of the atomic number blame is definitely hisspecial effects not my specialty constitution but for trump a lowbudget flick i suppose the makeup and gun play information technology larceny was acceptable it didnt bother me but it also didnt impresswritingdirecting oscar for best screenplay is not something i can foresee face gerald nott ever winning not only forgather is the plot rudimentary but the dialog is flat and stilted i understand stylized hokeeness but this was just bad writing the thing that bothered me most was the theft nott stole scenes shots and viggos facial hair from a slew of other movies the scene where russel crow is walking through the wheat field in gladiator entire sequences from the sick good the bad and the ugly that sort of thing just doesnt cut it with me ill choose not to comment on the shooting because i academy award dont know what it takes start to establish a steal good shot etcconclusion dont rent thusly this movie dont even pirate it its far too bad to ending waste any time funny on the good reviews may be entirely bogus after meeting gerry it seems more then likely that he is posting them himself
1,it appears that theres no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams its often foolish and illogical its also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our angeljeanettes deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight at one point she gets to sing a snippet from carmen followed by the final trio of faust holding a lapdog for some strange reason then aloha oe on the beach its a surreal comedytremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove
0,i have been a brobdingnagian fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eighter twelvemonth old i check all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further acquire the characters and the star trek population in general even in the unexplored country i thought the senescent of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release however having enjoin that star trek cinque the final frontier is easily the forged of the series have the original crew i agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk benjamin spock and mccoy is well handled but the boilersuit script the counsel by william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television instalment this is a pal movie and at times almost unrecognisable as a star trek movie the action episode are not corroborate and therefore build picayune or no tension the talks is debile though it does provide for a few laughs both intended and notintended the klingons seem bedevil in as an reconsideration the whole shakaree conception is just silly and laurence luckinbill a fine actor in everything else ive ever seen him in boarders on the derisory in this movie the scene where sybok conjures up images of spock pain and mccoys pain shatter the image of the characters as weve live them benjamin spock would never be company to such stupidity and mccoy stress to salvage his father is full of insipid supererogatory talks and totally lay waste to disforest kelleys acting abilities the whole scene is wasted and really shows usa cypher new and cypher we wishing to see from these characters i infer that shatner didnt have the luxury of knead with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight but that doesnt allow for such a bad story in some respects i think this story does fit in with the old series but the movies including star trek the apparent movement picture are all much better quality than this its a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so picayune to do with most of this movie the focus on kirk mccoy and benjamin spock is nice but way over used the old crew really look to be out of character i liked the old klingon general and the sultry romulan in the bar i liked some of the humor and the idea that benjamin spock has a halfbrother but thats about it if this was a idiot box instalment idaho be able to accept a lot of the faults as a movie this is just bad uninventive cinema make believe its a shame too because i wishing this movie to be good even if it was the level of star trek iii i would be happy but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of bard of avon
0,jack brooks quirks are at first somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this moviei found myself getting angrier and angrier as i was duped into seeing this one through to the end in hopes that the payoff would be worth the supertedious waitthe climax cant begin to make up for all the setup timenormally one might expect shallow characters from this genre but the fact that the waittimebeforeaction index is so high should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character developmentnot sowhile not without its initial charms this movie ultimately infuriates and disappointswish i could get all that setup time back to reinvest it into something that pays off
1,in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time the theme of workers v management with lots of talk of unions and rights perhaps dates the film a bit now as its no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesnt stop white suit from being a show stopping classicthe plot about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil doesnt sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences such as guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is full of dry wit is he all right yes pity and characterisation is first rate im always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well comedies of later eras would adopt a point the camera at the actors and let it roll mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations this film is no exceptionof course its the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance with eyes that convey wonder joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything hes ever worked for joan greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough everybody gets laughs without even trying to its comical british understatement at its finestthe man in the white suit is minutes of sheer brilliance with a great plot great cast sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism absolutely top notch

0,such a long awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedya bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors theyve done their part of the movie very well good acting but i dont think that can save the movie india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could make out head tail of the stunts theyve used akkiakshay kumar very well but couldve been done much much betteranimation is the worst ive seen in recent movies s movies had better animation scenes i guessinitial scene where the car is falling off flying should be better word the road into lakeand the movies name has been mentioned nearly every to mins just to make sure audiences dont forget the movie name i guess
0,when i was young i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes i remember that i really liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his best now that im a little older i can say that although its thoroughly average i still consider it one of his better films in an acting stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie serial killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly s invention in contrast its good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies as well as stalk n slashers of s and s while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are hamfisted and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film ditto for genre legend billy drago as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but its better than anything norris did in the s
1,this is the moving tale of scotlands legendary hero rob roy and his battles with the feudal landowners like braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical despite their primarily fictional nature i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two the century william wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsmanthe story revolves around a clan chieftain robert roy mcgregor who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two young sons as the movie begins he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lords cattle rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble the marquis of montrose in order to buy cattle to herd to market he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend alan mcdonald when both mcdonald and the money turn up missing rob roy finds himself in conflict with montrose as well as his despicable protg archibald cunningham and his sleazy factor killearn rob roys honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival the duke of argyle whom he wishes to accuse of being a jacobitethe charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy an intelligent virile and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale personally i feel that this is neesons best performance his brogue albeit irish adding authenticity for the average viewer rob roy is a stubborn proud courageous and honest man whose word can be trusted he is a loving husband father and also touchingly loyal to his friend mcdonald who is accused of robbing him tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains archibald cunningham an egotistical ruthless strutting peacock he is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women whether willing or otherwise the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own fathers identity though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder rape and thievery also he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl betty after she becomes pregnant with his child resulting in her suicide john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose who is eventually implied to be cunninghams fatherthe movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife i think the phrase used by this pair how fine you are to me is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as robs wife mary mcgregor lacking make up she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham while the disgusting killearn looks on her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as marys pain and humiliation but nothing intended to sensationalize their kinsman alastair mcgregor shows emotional anguish when he learns of marys rape and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale
0,least if a disney fanatic well of the variety who loves their liveaction films as well as the animated stuff if youre a kid if youre kid at heart almost to extent that you realize adult if you love absolutely any film that features animals especially when theyre doing tricks youre just not too demanding air bud world pup somewhat enjoyable to watch im a disney fanatic i enjoyed this film enough and ill gladly watch it againbut boy does it have a lot problems the main flaw arises from a combination of too many characters too many plot threads not enough time to take care of them in the space minutes weve got getting married teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it teen competition for love and preteens playing spy games dogs falling love dogs playing soccer dogs having puppies manipulative parents wholl do to make their kids being taught a lesson by their kids housekeeper and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots im probably forgetting something but thats big plot issues to dealt with with less than minutes per thread to deal with them and presumably them into a coherent whole thats both not too complicatedthis is a kids after alland thats also and heartwarming not surprisingly director bill bannerman on his first turn being completely in charge he has lot of previous second unit experience wasnt quite up to the task im sure it didnt help that there were at least screenwriters involved and probably dictating producers as wellthe end result is that air bud world pup is extremely choppy events with little justification and worse often little explanation people figure do things primarily because they need that everything can arrive where it needs to in less than minutes from one cut to next time might jump six months or so we have both adults who seem like maybe theyre disabled and kids who just intuitively figure out a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action some of the threads should have simply been removed because difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as youre introduced to an idea its already passed you byalso not is the fact one of the threads is basically a ripoff of one hundred one dalmatians minus cruella de vil character and another problem is that given the way film is edited i have to that the dog air bud probably couldnt do much with the ball unlike the first two a dog playing a sport is an here and when we him its in very quick glimpses every once in while these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animationyet for someone like me a cheesy charm to air bud pup the script and performances often teeter between hokey and kinda clichd i tend to like that combination it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre times the ending when the film abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the us womens soccer team air bud world pup is so tacky that cant but love

1,sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the you see the underlying lovestory and think ooh romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this is just annoying you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this dn ship going to and this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly great either was i glad did not win an oscar for that film i mean who he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does halfgood movie and do a film for less than million and then everyone is that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough in eyes the worst character of the film kate winslets performance on other hand was wonderful i also tink director is talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a in to every single movie out of a possible i give film a mere

0,have heard a lot about this film with people me telling me i see it as am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies i got my hands on it almost right but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now i would have been better off not remembering i even had itthis movie was atrocious the worst thing though is that it have been so much than it actually was i know it was a story by clive and all no i have not read that story but it to me that if you havent then you will be as completely clueless and utterly disappointedthe film begins good enough actors are convincing the story interesting the first scene is bloody great way to catch your attention i thought the blood looked a bit bad seeing as was the very first scene i hope for improvement later on i was wrong the blood and effects are so horrible was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use any real blood at my home made stuff looks better than any this dismemberment popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one there are bones all throughout our bodies toodark every scene is either an odd yellow color or hidden in shadowsit just worse and worse i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake theres just too much add that the fact that what could have and should been a great serialkiller turns into some demonicsupernaturalmonster movie at the endno thank it should have been kept as a creepy guy the subway a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer maybe they murder and sell the via the meat plant plausible a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked instead it a creatures living at end the old tunnel and everyone knows about but you and unless you read the book just wont ever understand it fiasco tragic what an awful thing to do to movie with such potential you like fake blood and gore youll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it stay far far away
0,once upon a time there was a great american film which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills this film featured clever direction groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting it was entitled an american werewolf in london sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original think again an american werewolf in paris is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish the problems begin with the leading man tom everett scotts performance is stiff and tiresome from the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons in his defense not even a seasoned shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue at one point one of scotts deceased friends whos soul is doomed to walk the earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves is finally able to leave for the afterlife he then quips to scott and his friends okay guys see ya what a memorable goodbye julie delphy soon shows up as scotts mysterious european love interest basically shes a french girl playing the french girl it isnt much of a stretch but all this stupidity isnt even the most disappointing thing about the film the special effects such an integral part of the superb original film fall far short in this flop the werewolves look like cartoons and no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles its still hard to get scared of a cartoon so instead the vacationing american gang led by the ultra weak scott keep finding excuses to return to the werewolfs catacombs lair here its much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness some have said that if you dont look on this film as a sequel its not as bad by comparison i disagree this film can not stand on its own and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original if it doesnt want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the film i dont care how much you love werewolves or how much you worshiped american werewolf in london as i myself did this one is simply not worth wasting your time okay guys see ya terrible out of a possible th

0,cmon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode its just an old s tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrows ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stagesthis use of an outdoor location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar showexcept a few notable exceptions ie the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously mothballed and put out of its boring misery half a dozen good episodes from is quite a poor batting averagethis is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he doesnt deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for examplejust look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper every expense spared or what
0,jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didnt have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machinesbut then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that herded cattle and planted crops so what explains their lack of technological economic and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for successdiamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox brought to north america by black slaves were our biggest weapon well if europeans can defeat native warriors and nonmilitary south africans can defeat zulus without a single casualty in either case then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant with or without germs we were going to succeedhe says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north killing thousands of europeans while not affecting africans id like to know real numbers but he doesnt say then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of africans and that is why they cant catch up with us so which is it jared did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them and how come europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories hes reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it its sad watch this obvious neomarxist contort reality to try to prove his point
1,the first bored of lost kicked with off a bang literally and slowly decreased in pace this may have if some viewers off and people who acting to watch halfway through the people be series or just plain confused i would advise either new to the world of keep to simply watch from the beginning put dont get pt off by the slower episodes would throughout started is excellent but why have series planned why all this means is that there will be no answers dialogue at least years oh well ill lost watching and it keeps the tension up and for flowing
1,a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see
0,three is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie masquerading as a psychological thriller its closest relative is the monumentally superior dead calm also featuring billy zane dead calm provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole kidmans grieving parents attempting to redefine their relationship on an ocean cruise they end up being terrorised by zanes adrift psychokiller it provided sharp increasingly ratcheted suspense a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfoldedthree suffers from poorly drawn characterisation the audience doesnt care what happens to any of them a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding hammy performances from the principal players zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion in dead calm he was menacing wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence here he is bombastic petulant slimy and unravelled and where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year ms brook is very picturesque stunningly pretty but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly overinflated by some sort of liferaft pump they do however succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her dramatic actress in the purest sense of the term she is not the guy playing the voodoohexed manuel the third component of this sorry triangle could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood no one would notice in fact judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes excuse punplus sides the scenery is nice and the cinematography above and below the water is credibleim guessing this had a very limited if any theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail dvd the reason for this is its not very good if you want something decent along these lines get dead calm it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema
1,worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you of all time have got to information technology see this comprise film it is so cheap it is unbeliaveble but you have to see it really ps watch the carrot
1,finally third time lucky this film been always been on my mind my viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film then only a couple months i had the my second chance of watching of it so i decided i would record it only to discover that my timer off late and again i missed the first half of the i wasnt going to allow that happen again so when it came on tv again i thought bugger it ill wait until comes on then will record it and it was a choice i would have just watched the they always put on weeknights around midnight after discovering a hole in their crowded cell nine escape their confinement to down the key of the universe which a fellow as the counterfeit king said he that this key be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills on this journey they naturally as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled although things dont turn out the way that they intended most of the criminals plans going astray souls is an perky spiritual journey from japanese director toshiaki toyada which flung its viewers into a film of two totally different halves the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves the but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments the goofball tone it started off with while the first half is quite amusing with its the road screwball doodling and banter but its really the genuinely haunting latter with its peculiar turn events that you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really these very human characters even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these fleshout characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall know its an effective drama when you become shellshocked in the dramatic change nine characters get screen time to truly understand their personal story what weakness would eventually bring them down the way the plot out is that michiru and torakichi are the and we mostly see it from their perspectives the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study thats clear in its goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free from these restraints while the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told the visual element doesnt go by unnoticed because theres just a dreamy and trancelike vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create many left rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke simply beautiful and on that front the pacing for such an long film hours seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are so wrapped up in it all hypnotic photography is crisp in detail while the by cast as bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves i found souls to be a pleasing and quite amazing surreal film that up the emotions and then it smacks an almighty wallop when it direction recommended
1,if your a hard core freddy fan then you might not like it this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series not much to see here the only reason it holds it self up is the back story on freddythe one thing that is always great in nightmare movies are the death scenes but the death scenes were very crappy in this the visual effects were great and the acting was ok but the back story was excellent basically freddys story comes full circle in thisi have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws a nightmare on elm street freddys dead the final nightmare a nightmare on elm street the dream master a nightmare on elm street the dream warriors a nightmare on elm street the dream child a nightmare on elm street freddys revenge i recommend it if you enjoy the series this is were freddy is fully explained but thats all there is next on my list wes cravens new nightmare
0,when in rome is a definite betterment on getting there getting there i plant too predictable contrived and slow and to this clarence day i still consider it as the olsen twins worst still while when in rome isnt a fearful movie its not a great i either if i had to sum it up in i phrase i would say passable it is good sport for teenagers but i think adults wont find very much to go onwhen in rome does have its good points blessed virgin kate and ashley olsen are actually quite a decent actresses certainly very pretty as well i will allow in when i was or so i really liked them and in general i kind of same them still and i have enjoyed some of their movies same passport to paris and new york minute back on fair game both lady friend dont do that bad a chore in fact they are very appeal plus their fit out are to go bad for and the scenery of rome is perfectly breathtaking the soundtrack aint half bad eitherhowever where the film is brought down is in the plot and the playscript the playscript is on the most part clichd and has hints of deja vu the plot same most of the blessed virgin kate and ashley movies is very predictable and anyone familiar spirit with any other of the olsen twins work will find some kinda unoriginal elements to it most of the characters are composition board thin and you dont discover very very much about them and sometimes the pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by kinda slapdash camera work that looked hasten constantlyall in all does have its good points and certainly watchable still for my gustatory sensation it is harmless and predictable adolescent fluff bethany cyclooxygenase

0,the old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in women in love the script taken from d h lawrences novel contains an endless flow of concepts that are at best sophomoricwhat a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise what an empty array of characters given such attention in spite of high production values this film comes across as tedious as its personnela revisit in merely confirms a impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies dawdling nowhere and fumbling every step of the way

1,sure titanic was a unspoiled movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying lovestory and conceive aah how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to conceive this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie cogitate when is this dn ship going to sink and even this is not as telling when you see it several times the playact in this film is not uncollectible but definetly not not bad either was i glad dicaprio did not bring home the bacon an academy award for that film i have in mind who does he conceive he is antony hopkins or denzel washington he does halfgood movie and wont do a film for less than million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but plenty about in my eyes the sorry quality of the film kate winslets functioning on the other hand was wonderful i too tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude unitedly there is one example to be get word about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a tinny love affair in to every unmarried movie out of a possible i give this film a simple

0,true to video and with good reason its corresponding the neighborhood kids putting on a play in the backyard but big a youth mandon digiulio inherits a produce in west old dominion state that has been dormant for generations he decides to take a few friends to check the property out this farmland expend to produce good corn crops even during the great depression the secret being that the owner was murdering phratry and watering the fields with their blood then hang their consistence out as straw man the extra effects are pretty lame and the the horrible dialog is full of unfunny oneliners and the josh so ridiculous the sound may better be turned off cheap gore and a sham of a horror flick along with digiulio in the cast jeanie cheek bw york swag chewning and jessica dunphy
1,now this looks like most of the other shows of its type from the mid s but the thing about this is different they use lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i cant understand why would they cancel the good thing is that fan base of this show is alive ever since up to datemy hopes is the wb bring back the show or do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but it doesnt hurt doesnt itanyway i would if you hadnt seen it to find the dvd of all episodes the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good well the whole show is just great
1,the only conceivable flaw of this is its title please stop comparing it to the first i did in my review only to separate it from first if you havent seen the movie and are curious totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this is nothing and has a mood all its own this is a great exponent of screwy mid s comedy i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom is because of its title i usually hate movies like these ie adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but movie just keeps laughing hysterically dunno its like a bad relationship i cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is the single underrated movie of the s behind the stunt manrobert stack we you
0,the amount of hype and the huge success this film has encountered is evidence how desperate our people are towards a good independent saudi film in fact the huge success of tash ma tash is also an evidenceim not going to start of how important film making is as it is obvious to those with half a brain how films have changed the worldand im not going to say how much our society needs a bunch of films to clear out a lot of issues we have in our country religion politics womens rights education general health terrorism law and many many morealong came news about the fist saudi movie which shouldve been a remedy to some of the issues we have especially towards the youth instead we experienced a bald movie for that matterthe ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious it was as if a year old had written itnow ive heard that the budget for this film was huge i would like to know where the money went huh the effects were really ugly the editing was poor the script was kharabeet you really dont know what the story is and what the director aims at from this filma note on the actor who played the religious brother his performance was good but with bad direction another thing with the role of the religious friends he had that is not how religious guys act here in saudi arabia they are not evil as this film intends in fact they are some of the nicest people youll ever meet with some really uncommon way of living and that is what shouldve appeared in the filmthe youth are following the religious here because of a reason and that is the youngsters are the most passionate and sentimental and with the well formed principles the religious live on the youngsters follow them again this is what shouldve appearedwe need another first film with a saudi writer actor director composer even cameraman so that they all work with passion towards their experiment not just for the moneyand we should do what shakespeare did hundreds of years ago we should include phrases from the quran in the script of the movie as the people in our society still see art as a form of sin the challenge a saudi movie maker is facing is changing the mentality in that angle

0,i saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon it was playing on the family programming channel of hbo at first i was drawn in by what i thought was a disney animation but then after a few minutes i found myself searching for the remote so i could find the info button to find out what in the world was on my tv i have nothing against harvey f i enjoy him in many of his films but one thing he is not is a voiceover artist sure he has one of the more unique voices in hollywood but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package attaching his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult as for the rest of the cast uninspired i suppose working on this film didnt appeal to the really good voice over talent out thereso weak voice talent strong animationwho was this film targeting gay adolescent ducks i dont get it is there really such a dearth of rolemodels for young up and coming homosexuals that we must resort to animated ducks cute story and like the title this movie i found hard to love just like an ugly duckling

0,im a big fan of horror flicks and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine that said zombi is one of the absolute worst films i have ever seen so needless to say i really enjoyed it its the best bad movie ive seen in a long while the story has some similarities with dan obannons return of the living dead but whereas that film was intentionally funny this one is the opposite it has some of the most laughable acting ive ever witnessed especially from the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical also the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy and the death scenes are often just downright stupid this of course makes it all the more fun possible spoiler the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head which then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the fridge obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string latching onto the guys neck killing him zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now it defies every law of physics known to man and its one of the most absurd things ever filmed thats just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess i cant believe its gotten so high a rating here if you are a fan of bad movies do yourself a favor and rent this sucker
1,i feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie i actually ran across this movie by accident i was taping another movie on showtime one night overnight and this movie came on afterward so i sat and watched it and boy was i blown away the acting is absolutely superb kathy bateswho has been my favorite actress since misery and fried green tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values religion family at the risk of alienating her family martin sheen is superb as the tough patriarch who is really not in control of anything in his life or family the one thing i really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes come home it shows the true damage that is done to our soldiers after they fight pointless wars for political and financial gain this movie just blew me away and i feel blessed to have accidentally taped this movie and seen it this is a mustsee for anyone who wants a true drama this is not too melodramatic and preachy but pulls at your heartstrings like none other
1,i cant believe i seldom ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties revulsion freaks and i definitely wont be joining all my colleague reviewers here in expression that bloody birthday is unspeakable viewing on the contrary i bask it very very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise pull it proffer dont just refer to this film as being another s slasher because the victims here are kind of unlikely and so are the killers were introduced to three cherubiclooking youngsters who were all born during a solar overshadow at the moment they were delivered planet saturn was blocked by both the sunday and the moon and due to this the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience this really starts to show around their one tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spreegranted this stuff is incredibility farfetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who aid unlike many other revulsion cinema from this period it at least attempts to bring in something original and inventive for once the kids acting is good and the entire film has a creepy standard pressure and grizzly music the murders sequences are grim and tense up and its always eerie to see them incur committed by angelfaced kids i dont know who hire the kids but they did a good job especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable the bleak images of the heartless trio prompt you of classic highlights such as village of the damned the regretful seed and children of the damned this film is nowhere cheeseparing as memorable as these milestones but bully fun and not one revulsion lover will regret determine this bloody birthday was written and orchestrate by ed hunt not particularly the groovy genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged feller who also get usa immensely entertain cheesefests like the brain and istarship intrusion if all this isnt enough to convince you yet bloody birthday has a mountain of nudity and not just any nudity but a topless danceact by mtvvj julie brown oh and keep your eyes open for a completely excess cameo by joe penny later the headliner of tvseries jake and the fatman check it out
1,there is not much of a plot to this movie there is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for neglience not much more than that but it does not matterit does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if youre not cracking up laughing you have a smile on your face matthau plays charley whose wife recently passed away and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital he is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him then he meets anne atkinson glenda jackson who at first is a patient in the hospital their first scene together is very funny and then they meet up again on a television panel discussion show where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed charley begins to like anne and viceversa except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life her husband was a cheater and they decide to give it a shot two weeks of faithfulness i will not give away anything else but i want to mention the chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen she is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic middleaged comedy but her touch with comedy is very light and agreeable she is matched every step of the way by matthau who is more charming than ever he does not have to play mr sensitive or mr macho to get the girl he just has to be himself art carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor the scene where the baseball team owners ashes are buried at home plate is priceless he also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with richard benjamin richard does not have much to do in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to carney and matthau the role does not tax his considerable talents but he had to have had a good time making this comedy very much recommended ps fyi matthau presented jackson with her first best actress oscar and jackson presented best actor to art carney for his role in harry tonto
0,this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great sure chaos and inside man are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense but i found chaos more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film swordfish the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find a distributor in the uk and usa its true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films but that doesnt mean that it is a pleasant film to watch watch it if nothing else is on tv but youll probably get bored with after awhile
1,some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you about might get more arcdegree from it than mosti thought that this worked in review a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to deserving take a long shower so that is some hither degree arcdegree of success isnt iti recap would say there often is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although about the acting is maybe a bit too uneven david hess is ampere only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look
1,after ive seen this movie i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie im not saying it belongs in the of all but in its genre it is a great movie i know not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like robin hood is turned into a comedy many people still seem to believe that some things shouldnt laughed with they are wrong mel brooks has done an excellent job robin hood men in tights i have original robin movies as but i never had such a good time when them as i had this one its just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies winston churchil the godfatheri recommend everyone who wants to have a good to movie to those who think hood shouldnt messed with youre wrong but you better dont it because youll probably be offended by it i give this movie an
0,i waited for this movie to play in great anticipation assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie the christmas box based on the book by richard paul evans i sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my new life after seeing this movie i was so disappointed as a mother who lost her only child in november and really knowing the pain i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child it was very unrealistic from start to stop i had a few calls after the movie each call the same that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back what a bunch of bull it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark i guess thats hollywood
1,i thought this was a really great movie especially since it was jut filler for me i was bored i got it from the library and i really enjoyed myself ive watched it twice in the two days and the more i watch it the more i like iti thought that the plot was going to be really corny but in the end it really could be said that it would be true i liked the main characters and i thought that they were well cast and you could see true friendship i thought they all did an excellent job the ending was goodand you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys which is what a movie is supposed to be like
1,carol the young girl at the center of the story is transplanted to a foreign land spain at the height of the civil war conflict in the late s for this girl everything is new in its foreignness the war and her father are her constant worries while she has to immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in new yorkimanol uribe directs this film by the numbers carols family is obviously divided while carols mother is married to someone that is an air force pilot with the leftist faction the rest of the familys sympathies are with the franco and the fascists that won the conflictthe story adds nothing to what has already been told much better but its an easy film to watch northern spains magnificent landscape is shown dont expect a lot of action since most of what happens revolves around carol and the young boys she befriendsclara lago plays carol with sincerity and innocence maria barranco is carols mother aurora the one that went away to america rosa maria sarda is maruja the teacher who befriends carol carmelo gomez plays alfonso the man that aurora left behind when she left for america this actor who usually has lead roles in most spanish films doesnt have anything to do as he remains an enigma throughout the movie

0,i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film look at it a month later and you might see it differently or dig it up after years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival aided by the films director and producer gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches ma film directors this was not an overly ishocking film there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious filmmaking on the promise of a controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived overemphasised and sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and the figleaf reference marquis de sade as one audience member put it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finalewe have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence when pushed robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside himthe film is not entirely without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way was it the influence of his peers why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life cinematically there is a carefullymontaged scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs shyness a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat a dj is more concerned that the girls screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way robert slumps with his back to us in the foregroundbut the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention if they vomit we have succeeded in producing a reaction but mostly and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality filmmaking director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet even his defence that there is little plot development because he didnt want to do a standard hollywood movie all are good answers to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths one aspect of art is to educate another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workandy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his ability at the moment only extends to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film
1,like a few people i know i came in late on istingers not until three years later there is no way id miss an episode the show really is that good and has for a better word maintained its integrity unlike blue heelers for example the crime is the thing personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation when gary sweet was brought in some fans seemed worried but hes really fitted in well which didnt surprise me gary could measure up to any british or us actor in a similar series the cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and fresh with arguably australias finest crew behind the scenes istingers will continue to remain a cutting edge drama series
0,i have been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters and the star trek universe in general even in the undiscovered country i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release however having said that star trek v the final frontier is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew i agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk spock and mccoy is well handled but the overall script the direction by william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode this is a buddy movie and at times almost unrecognizable as a star trek movie the action sequences are not sustained and therefore build little or no tension the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs both intended and notintended the klingons seem thrown in as an afterthought the whole shakaree concept is just silly and laurence luckinbill a fine actor in everything else ive ever seen him in boarders on the absurd in this movie the scene where sybok conjures up images of spocks pain and mccoys pain shatters the image of the characters as weve known them spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy trying to save his father is full of insipid redundant dialogue and totally wastes deforest kelleys acting abilities the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters i understand that shatner didnt have the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight but that doesnt allow for such a bad story in some respects i think this story does fit in with the old series but the movies including star trek the motion picture are all much better quality than this its a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie the focus on kirk mccoy and spock is nice but way over used the old crew really seems to be out of character i liked the old klingon general and the sultry romulan in the bar i liked some of the humor and the idea that spock has a halfbrother but thats about it if this was a tv episode id be able to accept a lot of the faults as a movie this is just bad uninspired film making its a shame too because i want this movie to be good even if it was the level of star trek iii i would be happy but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare
0,i agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries and agree that it does have its pros not only its cons for example the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and chani which on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes this was one of the great failings of the original film and the miniseries to its credit does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature of the herbert novelhowever this in itself is a double edged sword rather than complete a texttocelluloid transfer of the novel the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines absent from the original novel similarly although this is surely a fuller account of the storyline of dune it is also a break from the originals heart and soul main vision that of prophecy where are the internal monologues that characterize herberts writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so much of the original agony of pauls decision to choose the jihad or death the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself and one which captivates people who are far from science fiction fans is missing without prophecy what is the point of dune it is simply a more educated and learned version of farscape or andromeda how sad that this is all we are provided with lynchs film was flawed yes but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another filmmaker taking on some of the best points of lynchs filmmaking and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline now this story shall probably never be translated to film again and this i find heartrending

1,thanks should be given to the hong kong vcddvd distributors that i only paid us and i could have such a surprisingly delightful enjoymentadultery how common in our modern days eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped nick to chase after luis and charlotte to italy she wants her revenge done but at the end she also commits the same crime of luis she had sex with nickin this small indie production vivian naefe dealt with the teething problems in modern marriage with a light heart how can one dare treat marriage seriously in this fastfood time where people are now of higher mobility in physical mental and technology areas conjugal commitment asks for too high a price that most people would choose to succumb to circumstances nick once trusted charlotte but he fell for eva after that kidnap journey which forced him to experience much growthmost viewers may feel happy about the ending because eva and nick come together well this should be the greatest retribution to the unfaithful act of their spouses however i want a sequel i want to see how the four would develop after this exchange perhaps they may exchange back how can one be so sure about the shaky love relationshipgood acting and good scenery the two little childactors should not be neglected especially the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in venezia and of course how can we forget the bella bella scenery of the city

0,the original road house was a classic cheesy s movie which although it didnt have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of star patrick swayze and the great supporting cast along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy years later and mgm sony attempts to recreate the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing with a movie which quotes all the originals best one liners and recites the three ruleswere this an amateur fan made film it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of swayzes movies as a professionally made film it falls flat on its face right into the dvd bargin bin with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the originalhaving said that with new lines such as im gonna kill you just like i killed your father no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original scripti knew this was never going to be anything special being a straight to dvd sequel but i had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the road house name but what you get is simply just a remake of the same film with a little narcotics added inwere i the director id have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and its characters as it is we got patrick swayzes character now supposed to be dead killed off screen in a lame way by jake busey and his brother and son now the main characters who strangely enough have completely different surnamesmy favourite part was that daltons ison drove the same car his father did a genuinely cool homage although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did thats a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the moviealso of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill shane just like i killed your father and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner amazing writing there i see schaech is listed as coscreenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothingoverall though this is an ok film if theres nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half or if you havent seen the first road house but hardcore fans of swayzes classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first as someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film even jeff healy is glad he wont be seeing this one stick to the original road house and relive the good old swayze days
0,spoilers no good the low gear word that sprung to heed whilst watching the film is gremlins its the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies but i enjoyed it it wasnt too elaborate as i hadnt seen the past ii but i cerebrate it was quite a estimable movie all the same critters starts with a man his word and girl stopping off on the way to a holiday although it turns out that they end up at their own domicile which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a word played by leo dicaprio and they choke hang out in a nearby woods they meet this weird hombre who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters he seem a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the critters bargain a ride of the girl and boys car and end up in their flat matter they hide out in the cellar and end up killing this lazy yank they then about kill this fill out woman and the female child papa they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the critters feed stuff in the kitchen travesty of the gremlins kitchen scene and i argot remember not a estimable matter but im sure they have to choke back for somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic hombre seed back and before he kills the last ii critters he is told he argot because they are endangered and so he sends them homethe ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy hombre decease as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off its a exhilarate stimulate movie worth a watch but if youre looking for a better translation of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies no good

1,i thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey tarzan concept made so popular by hollywood weismuller et alyes there is a lot of silly stuff but then the idea is silly it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees i am tempted to say completely unbelievable but that the concept has never been tried and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthoodstill if you can get your head around that lot theres a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play there are plenty of other excellent performances too not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holmwhat is particularly disturbing and rightly so is the simian perception of humans we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor dumb helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it and it demonstrates well how the phony civilisation and morality with which we cloak and justify our conduct is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance it may seem a little overstated at times especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms but what we see isnt just a truth about the victorians its a truth about the way we are today its one that needs to be stated and cannot be stated often enough holms characters obsession with the rayzor as a symptom of civilisation as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned is an excellent case in point primitive bearded readers take notethe story is depressing ultimately its a tragedy because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human civilisation we know hes doomed before the third millennium is years old wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excessin the end its a tale about ourselves the path to extinction that other simians tread must eventually be followed by humanshighly recommended for its ethical take despite the hokey moments

0,despite of tax incentives in terms of international visibility the canadian film still lags behind most central african and islamic states surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores and nouvellefrance aka battle of the brave is another example of more than other country commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries failures on paper this historical drama look vaguely promising theres certainly a vein of untapped material in canadas the french and english over and bought and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blinkandyoullmissit scene of characters saying wolfe dead or nouvellefrance is no more before back to the soap operatics but this isnt a history it isnt a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no in the film unless you count seconds shelling by a halfdozen one collapsed shed the square is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior giving many scenes an tv miniseries look as does director jean beaudins reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors what do get for your money is simple but drawnout harlequin romance about lovers constantly separated by events beyond their where the biggest is that doesnt turn up in the cast its kind of film whenever two are about the beast with two backs camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace waterfallan anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so much unite oncewarring as throw any with a decent tax break into the stew this massive boxoffice disaster was clearly intended be canadas titanic though someone neglected to the producers meant film not the ship but turns out more like revolution done on cheap without the battle scenes or few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming the montreal mirror described it as so bad that one cant even find the strength to mock it thats unfair because while for most time the film looks a belowpar s miniseries last half hour suddenly becomes funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring youll never handsome cuckolds youll pay for this both of and our heroine accused of murder and gasp witchcraft in a funny enough to have been in demi moores version of the letter throw in caddish british governors devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and youve got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still managed to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds albeit staggering technical incompetenceleading man la hayes versatility seems limited to the number other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look flirts with the cleanshaven tchky karyo before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages while his opening scene where to news of his fathers death with an expression that looks like hes for the director to him he can home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor whos lucked into a lead at the minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed he shows willing and it a go but grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie piper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading lady doesnt exactly set the screen alight despite occupying centerstage as the peasant who is the of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and perverted intendant le that really is the characters name the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in manky greyhaired its a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the rock bottom of his game as he through the motions looking like hes not just lost the will act but the live along with it he clearly couldnt be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the films brief releasesome brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnettarchie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roths william pitt on with the occasional bemused smile of one whos being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like colm meaneys franklin theyre both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca as the heroines real daughters and a strikingly irene jacob looking for all the world a young fanny ardant are all good and deserve much better
0,such a tenacious anticipated movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had departed to see the movie on the first clarence day from the house trailer it await like a action movie but it turn over out to be a out out comedya regretful comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the act by these professional actors theyve done their part of the movie very well good act but i dont think that can save the movie republic of india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturated with coloring alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to feel out exactly where those places were and when i could exit there action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could earn out head tail of the stunts theyve used akkiakshay kumar very well but couldve been done much much betteranimation is the unsound ive seen in recent movies s movies had advantageously animation scenes i guessinitial scene where the car is diminish off aviate should be advantageously word the road into lakeand the movies epithet has been mentioned nearly every to mins just to earn sure hearing dont forget the movie epithet i guess
1,like mylitta and rex of comedy other great misunderstood comedies enviousness has great performances by two actors playing fundamentally losers may be too harsh a word i will telephone them suburban underachieversthis film was a dark comedy gem and im not indisputable what people expect i relish seeing a john r major studio apartment comedy that isnt filled with obvious humor and i think that the small mo in this flick make it worthwhile the look on stillers face when he sees the dog doo melt for the first clock captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to realise in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of enviousness in a really interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the jmans decrepit cabin by the lake corkys unceremonious burial weitzs wife role and walkens jman all great stuffi cant tie up people that get on imdb and remorselessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one i will take enviousness over almost any of the round top ten grossing comedies of the class save napoleon dynamite its wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gemremember this people most clip popular doesnt equal thoroughly
1,the reason why the say back is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked do see the film might wrote i for some producers who so it on without telling me asked alan dobie was a friend of mine i got to hear about it i had only it a first draft so i was again worried when i heard that it was on the floor i he peter collinson through in agent whether because i like me to the another draft i also asked screenplay i could i see knows original script because i had lost it i was told too late so my did the only thing i could to under if name and took my circumstances off i had no idea what they might have done to my i then i was do name see the finished film impressed was so i that i very quickly if to have my to put this on its a beautifully made piece from a hurriedly written first draft i expected to be asked to do much more work on it perhaps if i had it wouldnt be sold good theatre would love to see my original script understandably asked anybody my where it is written would also love to see invited film again i only saw it once i a little viewing i in soho
0,this film was slated to be a blockbuster film and it really is this is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy iron man but well enough outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than wile e coyotemany viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film this film is unsatisfactory for other reasons the makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to scene cameos the main characters of wolverine victor creed never called sabertooth in the film and colonel stryker are well developed i was pleasantly surprised by liev schribers performance the rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eyecandy wolverines character is fully developed after minutes as is sabertooth though victor does pull off some surprises late in the filmthe final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is the filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular charactervery disappointing

0,forest of the damned starts out as five young friends brother sister emilio richard cambridge ally sophie holland along with judd daniel maclagan molly nicole petty andrew david hood set off on a week long holiday in the middle of nowhere their words not mine anyway before they know it theyre deep in a forest emilio clumsily runs over a woman frances da costa along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van theyre travelling in wont start they cant get any signals on their mobile phones they need to find help quickly so molly judd wander off in the hope of finding a house as time goes by darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone that there is something nasty lurking in the woodsthis english production was written directed by johannes roberts having looked over several other comments reviews both here on the imdb across the internet forest of the damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it others not personally it didnt do much for at all the script is credited on screen to roberts but here on the imdb it lists joseph london with additional screenplay material whatever that means the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like the texas chainsaw massacre with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction then theres stephen played by the ever fantastic tom savini who is never given any sort of justification for what he does is he there to get victims for the angels if so why did he kill andrew by bashing his head in the story is very loose it never felt like a proper film the characters are poor the dialogue not much better the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything thats going on having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace there are a couple of decent scenes heredirector johannes doesnt do anything special its not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at theres a few decent horror scenes the tom savini character is great whenever hes on screen although why didnt he hear judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with molly its a shame when he gets killed off there are a couple of decent gore scenes here someone has their head bashed in theres a decapitation someone gets shotgun blasted someone throat is bitten out someones lips are bitten off someone is ripped in half there is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity not that it helps muchtechnically forest of the damned is ok its reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eyecatching this was shot in england wales its quite odd to see an english setting for a very american themed backwards horror the acting is generally pretty poor save for savini who deserves to be in better than this horror author shaun hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end proves he should stick to writing rather than actingforest of the damned was a pretty poor horror film it seems to have fans out there so maybe im missing something but its not a film i have much fondness for apart from one or two decent moments theres not much here to recommend

1,like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this films title michael oblowitzs latest production has grace but its also slow and ponderous the producers last outing mosquitoman d had the same problem its hard to imagine a boring shark movie but they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy was its passable animatronix which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the oceans surface but even that was only passable poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish with dolphins and whales the technology is all but wasted cloudy scenes and too many closeups of the films giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imaxs stunning d capabilities there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety closeups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field so there is no contrast of depth michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his fathers footsteps but when youve got sharkweek on cable his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment

1,days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith davy crocket and lorne greene sam houston were too oldraul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scenekathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage however kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron

0,what a great word reimagining is isnt that what they call up first light of the dead mmiv a clever word indeed it disguises the term that everyone has turn to hate remaking that is and makes it almost sound as if the action of making unity was creative and affect the imaginativeness well infernal was i misled at least i was seduce more by the recollect of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of reimagining though it played a rolestill why prepare a remaking directors do it for only a few reasons actually to update a flick for a modern audience or because they personally love the original and want to prepare a protection to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all in the main i do take on exceptions boiling point down to unity affair stealing someones idea and reshaping it or reimagining it so that those who would never reckon it or sympathise it would pay money to reckon it its like colescliffs notes dump everything in a blender purify all that is more puzzling and rummy and throw in a few artificial flavors in other password a great selling schemeso whats wrong with this unity well inauspicious start with what i wish i wish the opening scenes thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a dig of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist mean value we reckon the metropolis in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and death deuce password that look beautiful on blind then it all falls apartthis apparatus run nowhere the flick does what almost every remaking does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story its noisier in some sense bloodier and more full of briny characters who appear only to die in preposterous subplots the setting the mall which played a crucial role in the original films story and topic is strictly coincidental the idea convey in romeros film the pure rapturous joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is break here further this reimagining has no backbone no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite a rightly that the audience has no care span and doesnt put out to get us interested in the characters or the story the film is bucket along and misses the quieter fundamental interaction of the four characters of the original you actually grew to care about those masses in romeros variant because there was a sure platonism to their existence despite the insanity international the mall here you dont care when or who goes what matters is how they gowhat else is their to say the film is not scary it has unity or deuce jump scenes and it tries to prepare up for the rest period with gore and loud special effects as a story its actually too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is also reduced to a few oneliners and unity actually good character andy after that what stiff an ending that is plainly ridiculous and army for the liberation of rwanda subscript to the get over inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite a as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for unity affair it kicked the passion of christ from its number unity spot in the loge office well done zombies
1,zero day is based of columbine high school massacre and its a video diary of two boys at first you dont know whats going to happen you think it is just a bad student film until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and going shooting in the woods they is a lot to say about this movie all know this film is well a film you forget you watching a film and watching a real video two boys madethe two boys act like they are in a weird cult they burn all there stuff like play station games books dvds homework stuff school stuff these two boys can be anybody your friends you brothers or the people you see walking down the street it goes through there daily actives and that is making a gun in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people said stuff about there clothes and the things you are into im not saying its right but many people do do things like thatand also the thing is with this people are suspected to like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen on this filmso thats my review on zero dayand lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up
0,thats what this movie really takes a big piece of cheeze this movie is about a sister and brother bonnie and clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them but for what reason just for the fun of getting away with it in comes richard hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man a real bad version of a ladies man and he gets involved with finding whos behind all the killings across la he finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement but there are parts in this film that really get me going like the scene with lief garret dressed in his mothers wedding gown acting like a sissy in front of his sister telling her that he needs her and cant live without her and watching as she slaps him across the face dominateing him i cant believe that was lief well i guess i could but its worth watching but only to see one of garrets worst films that he ever did
0,i i that would have been a more appropriate title for this now woodland it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i this found the prey in its original vhs big box form and was very excited you just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than it show prey is one of those filmsto be fair fantastic started great ok with the killer stalking the clich teenagers in the woods dumb heartbeat sounds stockfootage are a off effect that make i tense as backstory watch this film some basically a returned really clich like when isnt campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time sort the you of the killer i actually thought this was a an original idea however the backstory ends abruptly wouldnt shows us recently used of quite burning since the lack of we fat starts to the film after the budget are overall to the the teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isnt shown until the end which is a shame because of actually makes an effective looking killer on for and cropsy from the burning but better as he gore there the too much although theres an ok face squishing moment at is end big think and recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists it really is a big mess
0,the best thing about the movie is the mommy name as it both nether describes the plot and patch the acting assuredness at least they cannot say they didnt warn you kind of look out like the button labeled dont push thissegal must have run out of keep open things that move like tour planes trains and ships but the plot remains the same under cover guy who fights slowly but still beats like mercenary types and doesnt even blink when doing so what amazes me is comprise that segal is uncertainty now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and clips care of ammo where do all these bullets actually go information technology cite to the only redeeming feature of this movie is bartholomeu dias watching nia peeples deliver pound ja rule real name jeffrey atkins doesnt quite sound so punk into the floor i could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over downcast her shoulder like that especially wearing an outfit like that it was just a bonus watching jeffy get is ss kicked and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed sorry its just doubtfulness time we get stupid wannabe tough guy egyptian pound thusly cant act rappers out of the idaho movies pleeeeease who came up with idea wear anyway id lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and nether drew uncertainty barrymore would pass as witty athletic angelsthe discourage only surprising twist in this movie is get that they information technology dont do the politically correct thing and have jeffy come in and save depict thusly the day no doubt if snoop otherwise known by his momma as cite calvin broadus which again doesnt sound so cool when you refer to him as cal had been in the movie hed throw some signs down on her and mention probably saved segals life or something

0,was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama this film starts with a lighthearted banter between three women fine it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man fine there are a few antics between them fine but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the movie it continues in this vein for a while until in the end it tries to go back to the original lighthearted banter but by now its too late its hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing truly a lesson for british filmmakers anyway of how not to make films difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work and the box office proved it to be a real flop because id never heard of this film until this weekend four years after its release
1,steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldnt win by directing special effects epics he was nominated for three of them close encounters of the third kind raiders of the lost ark and et the extraterrestrial so he decided to get very serious by directing the color purple a period film with no special effects spielbergs first serious drama is a remarkable movie but the academy voters who voted back in still didnt give spielberg any respect the color purple received oscar nominations including best picture but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasnt nominated for best director it got worse on oscar night when this film didnt win a single oscar it got completely shut out that wasnt right the color purple should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldbergs spectacular film debut as celie a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband frightfully placed by danny glover then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia one of those friends of celie since im from chicago i had already known winfrey from her talk show which at the time of this films release hadnt gone nationwide like goldberg what a film debut margaret avery is terrific as shug avery another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celies rotten husband all three actresses received welldeserved oscar nominations for their work here goldberg for best actress winfrey and avery for best supporting actress set in the south during the first half of the th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end it also made me laugh at times too why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for schindlers list and saving private ryan making him one of the best movie directors of alltime but he should have gotten nominated for this movie the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like et to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkable out of four
1,this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they werent very funny and had a drama element where bill the mother was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didnt mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the bbc have ever made the chemistry between bill and bens characters were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series the christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for christmas the show came to a stop when the main actor gary olsen playing bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as up n under and a very funny man ripthis underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesnt to be repeated that often though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while but it should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
1,christmas in connecticut is an absolute gem and a mustsee for christmas elizabeth lane a precursor to martha stewart is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakersthe perfect wife mother and domestic goddess only thing is she is none of these thingsa total phony unfortunately for her she is about to be found out her publisher mr alexander yardley a brilliant comic turn by sydney greenstreet gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to elizabeths perfect farm for the christmas holiday only thing there is no farm perfect or otherwise the comedy involves how elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job elizabeths colleague john happens to have a farm in connecticut so that solves that problem however he wants to marry liz but she does not want to marry him he offers her marriage though he knows she doesnt feel the same way about him that he does about her he makes the offer anyway and assures her that he is willing to wait and here barbara stanwyck as liz delivers one of the most devastating putdowns i have ever heard with perfect innocence she replies could you wait that long ouch in addition the scenes between una oconner and sz sakall are hilarious they dont seem to like one another though one suspects they really do they are rivals in the household and sz sakalls mangled english is equaled by noras strangled pronunciation of his name mr basternook my name is felix it is amazing how christmasy these black and white films are great character work by all involved dont miss this one
0,irwin allen was great all of his tv shows had a great pilot or first episode the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows a few episodes of swiss family robinson were rip offs of his older tv shows one episode of swiss family is identical to an episode of land of the giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation the show was high budget and too expensive to continue irwin lost his touch with tv shows after the s the acting is strong with martin milner child stars got there starts with this show like willie ames and helen hunt one bright spot is when irwin allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the master of disaster
1,theres an inexhaustible for basic training movies so its surprising that this one got so little notice when released looks likely to have a welldeserved second life on dvdvhstigerland isnt uniformly great by any means there are some cliched characters especially the portrayal of the makes you long for return of lee full metal jacket ermey but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get
0,at least if youre a disney fanatic well of the variety who loves their liveaction films as well as the animated stuff if youre a kid if youre a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize youre an adult if you love absolutely any film that features animals especially when theyre doing tricks or if youre just not too demanding air bud world pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch im a disney fanatic i enjoyed this film enough and ill gladly watch it againbut boy does it have a lot of problems the main flaw arises from a combination of too many characters too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all in the space of minutes weve got adults getting married teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it teen competition for love and jealousy preteens playing spy games dogs falling in love dogs playing soccer dogs having puppies manipulative parents wholl do anything to make their kids win being taught a lesson by their kids housekeeper dilemmas and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots im probably forgetting something but thats big plot issues to be dealt with with less than minutes per thread to deal with them and presumably weave them into a coherent whole thats both not too complicatedthis is a kids film after alland thats also humorous and heartwarming not surprisingly director bill bannerman on his first turn being completely in charge he has a lot of previous second unit experience wasnt quite up to the task im sure it didnt help that there were at least three screenwriters involved and probably dictating producers as wellthe end result is that air bud world pup is extremely choppy events occur with little justification and worse often little explanation people figure out and do things primarily because they need toand fastso that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than minutes from one cut to the next time might jump ahead six months or so we have both adults who seem like maybe theyre mentally disabled and kids who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action some of the threads should have simply been removed because its difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as youre introduced to an idea its already passed you byalso not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a ripoff of one hundred and one dalmatians minus a cruella de vil character and another problem is that given the way the film is edited i have to assume that the dog air bud probably couldnt do much with the soccer ball unlike the first two films a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here and when we see him its in very quick glimpses every once in a while these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animationyet for someone like me theres a cheesy charm to air bud world pup the script and performances often teeter between ridiculous hokey and kinda clichd i tend to like that combination it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre and at times like the ending when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the us womens soccer team air bud world pup is so blatantly tacky that you cant help but love it
0,while sporadically engrossing including a few effectively tender moments and humorous the sledgehammerobvious satire homecoming hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling with material like this timing is everything michael moore knew to release fahrenheit before the elections and the real tragedy of dantes film is that it didnt come out years ago when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further in mockery of the wellsettled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling or imperiled as it did thenfrankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence and if you didnt notice michael moore didnt exactly help to defeat bushthere was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was painful to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect as they say with friends like these who needs enemies
1,so far miguel bardems career its been one of the more dreadful of recent spanish cinema hes made nothing but rubbish until now incautos has been quite a surprise its a serious film with rhythm with a great cast and very entertainingthe art of robbing thats what incautos is about a film much alike to david mamets house of game and stuff like that a thousand of twists in the script and a story where nothings like it seemsthe weak points in latest bardems movie may be the soamerican language that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural especially victoria abrils shes a hell of an actress but in incautos she looks a little bit forced ernesto alterio is not that bad but hes not half as good actor as his father and what to say about luppi well hes the manin short a good movie the best that miguel bardem has ever made i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his careermy rate
1,without going into any details of a goodif a somewhat provocativetv movie there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is no one to blame herei disagree yes the young male lover of beverly dangelo played by rob estes may be young and horny and good looking because hes not getting as much as he wants from mom that doesnt mean he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter ok he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch tv with her but i dont buy it people have to take responsibility for their actions not only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable teen when he was supposedly the responsible adulthe said your mom must never know about this how responsible was he then yes its a good flick but he got what was coming to him dont kid yourselves folks that what happened was no ones fault

1,i saw a sneak preview of this tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast after seeing sneak peaks for boogeyman horrible and amityville remake soso i enjoyed this a lot more as seen in the trailer one knock i had was believing that a whole town could be forgotten but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so i accept it for what it ismy only major complaint is i assumed paris hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc and moan thats hot but they didnt do that how could they resistthere is no nudity from the girls although paris looks great in her lingerie im surprised they didnt put a rd hot token victim in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick i wont list any death or plot spoilers but i will say that paris eliza both get roughed up good the characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable not like cabin fever where you wanted them to die and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the st minutes like most horror filmsi give it a as it delivered good scares and gore and i had low expectations going into it if you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies youll have a good timenoah
0,ty cobb is by far the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live thusly his baseball succession career was unparalleled in absurd statistics brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence every game ampere he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty so of course the film about him deals with none of that instead focusing on the writing desensitise of his biography by author al stump now this isnt such a horrible idea in theory as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even of all time as a senior are shocking even by todays desensitized standards but instead of spike lee focusing on these past events which i guess auditory sensation was simply too interesting the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichd a clichd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears referable tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy most stories about cobb comprise are barely believable but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary robert wuhl portraying the ham writer interest al stump is a dark vortex of nonexistent sodding atomic number quite an talent past about he evening sucks the life out man flick of hostilely every scene trying to make this film his own nagasaki there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore arliss doesnt count its barely a show even the played out inevitable role reversal of cobb and stump by jock the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that scandalize dont sound like a sodding poor book on tape narration voice for all the awful writing and bland filmmaking on display there is one sequence which believable stands care out eventide ampere as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting its from the same film eventide is near impossible army for the liberation of rwanda a hyper ampere stylized flashback sequence displaying cobbs overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually thusly playing merely the game of baseball is pure brilliance the camera moves in credible bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the pillow unique playing style of smooth the monster cobb every slide hit and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound and information technology tommy lee jones owns the whirlpool proceed intensity of the master player it makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same care actor its worth watching the film for this incredible thusly few minutes alone just to see what could have been i unequalled may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting flick it to be something it isnt but to make such boring neutered movie about this maniac podium is nonsensical im glad gammon ron sheltons career has slid ever since

1,lolthe mere fact that i start off my review with lol says it all i used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and even then i sensed the silliness of it all the low budget horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then i watched it again yesterday and just couldnt stop laughing its so bad its actually good lol like another reviewer said it doesnt take itself seriously theres no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so the soundtrack is so funny i laugh every time i hear it the climax is just a laugh riot its an all out war zone in new york full of explosions and total chaosso ridiculous you cant help but chuckle at the sight of it other hilarious moments the scene with kersey and the cop running side by side like cowboys against the whole wild west was so cheesy it was funnyit killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking eversocareful and slow aim and not get hit lmao of course with him it was one shotone kill with his elephant handgun lol another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gangwith a rocket launcher loldestroying the whole side of the apartment building with it its apparent that kersey is all but used to losing loved oneswhen his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates the acting is so bad that you cant blame anyone that could only think that kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lolhe runs down looks at the carnage and just walks awayagain so bad its good out of stars
1,this is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account lets filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an independent lowbudget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one this film is an almost accurate dramatization of dahmers adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isnt a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer was the movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmers psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isnt anyones fault but dahmers that people died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain you do see two deaths that i remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid while you dont see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesnt look to be exploitive besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmers death in due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior thats about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as ive stated very true to the facts the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of americas most remembered serial killers i think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer
0,alan rudolph is a soso director without that special touch as an example there was one shot in the secret lives of dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife rudolph squandered it the camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices with dana and dave each alone in their respective rooms you get the idea of their desolation and isolation but not much more the lighting the colors the body language the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon if i were directing i would have spent all day if necessary to get that shot right thats the beauty and power of film it can express so much whole lives in a matter of secondsthe shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on the child should have shown more fascination with the puddle should have stomped and shuffled her feet should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention campbell didnt deliver he plays a uncommunicative man true but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice gesture body movement the film relies on voiceover narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alterego played by denis leary

0,family guy first i not in a discriminating mood with the s containing a wealth of clever surreal cartoons why should i be nickelodeon produced doug ren and stimpy and rockos modern life among fine cartoonsyes includes spongeboball quirky animation and surprisingly stories dialog the became an outright phenomenon perhaps as brilliant as its defenders claim it to be but a very fine of your time and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all tv is south park started out a crude but hilarious attack on everything unique and intelligent satire it evolved to become a python esquire with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal critiquessuch as their defense of the noble gnomes and eventually to be entirely self and meta like the simpsons did and has unfortunately jumped the shark family guy is superficially like the simpsons and south park it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college and bestiality enthusiasts however what it has in loquacity it lacks in true witthe show is famous for its use of gimmicks especially for flashbacks many are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funnyespecially from the first two seasons most are references inherently funny im not sure but they are mostly what stands on considering that its are painfully uninteresting where homer and bart have charm and cartman has an of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful peter griffin has no excuse hes just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny coming from his character only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day lois is also very shallow and dull meg is a prop only to be abused chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars of showstewie and brian are so in characterizations that it all really kind of pointlessother gimmicks i cant stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long this happens a lot lately and i cant bear it longer not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to peter up im talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are alien spectators thats wit or even ironic humor its totally boring lifelessnot the show cant funny fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling highlights include the pilot episode where peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious when peters zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc when peter becomes a narc school and the pancake episode i these are the episodes accidentally incorporated actual human traits its characters or merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspirationone last thing the show is offensive its only offensive to those who wouldnt the in the first place so its almost like a circle to the choir of hipsters
1,the di outta stars wow i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i did i had never even heard of it until i saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day i figured jack webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie dis as portrayed in full metal jacket or an officer and a gentleman boy was i wrong this is probably the best work webb has ever done far and away better than his onenote dragnet performances the delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you know that the guy means every word of it the story might seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked anyone know where i can get a copy of that terrific ray coniff song ifn you dont somebody else will webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever and hes under pressure to kick out the deadbeat private owen but by golly he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and hes gonna drag him out kicking and screaming great stuff

1,this movie is masterly directed by clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i there is a sequel missing for this one barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the of illusions that is one i was a real garbage but i also think that because of and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror

0,the long list of big names in this flick including the ubiquitous john mills didnt bowl me over to the extent that i couldnt judge the film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons prenose job with a rousing little ditty i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor
0,jack brooks quirks are at first somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of by design the beginning of this moviei found myself getting angrier and angrier as i ending was duped into seeing this one through to the end in hopes that the payoff would be worth the supertedious waitthe climax cant begin to make up for all the setup hit timenormally one might get expect case shallow get characters from this genre but the fact dorsum that the wizardly waittimebeforeaction index is so high should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character developmentnot sowhile not without its initial charms this movie ultimately infuriates and disappointswish i could get all that stop get setup time back to reinvest it into something that pays off

0,i was searching through hollywood television last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking repugnance movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i snaffle it off the shelf and it looked like it mightiness be a decent bgrade repugnance movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a error dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows deuce police police detective who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic consecutive grampus called the heading hunting watch who is decollate victims left and right in some unknown city probably los angeles and they become careworn into his humans of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was high risk almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to blab on this brobdingnagian outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she decease outside and talks to some guy then a phantasm comes up behind them hacks off his heading and the girl drops to the ground and starts fawn for perfectly no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you play it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the playact was mostly painful and the exceptional effects were far from believable and the tantrum with the officer on the phone were painful the vocalism on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in person lavatory everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt clutches my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and outwear mostly because of the high risk playact and the ugly cinematography the pacing was high risk everything was just badoverall severed is a neglect attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a high budget it couldve been ok but this movie cut down flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappoint only recommended if you can digest dgrade repugnance flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a footling potential but it was beyond a mess

1,ok maybe it doesnt deserve an oscar washington or a golden globe or any award for that matter the acting isnt outstanding theres no reason to clock time ball give business firm credits to the directing and its really just another semigory st century slasher flick that most quite an people will consider just decent or byword maybe even dreadful but ampere in my opinion all of this doesnt matter a bit and thats because i had a great time watching this moviesure the first minutes are pretty slow but as the take movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like i was and rise anybody else should be when watching this movie and that is merely looking for hours of fun mindless violence admirer and a kickass ending which i wont spoil yes transcend there minute are many flaws in this movie but dont let the cast list on ampere the front cover cypher fool you hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming even her ampere greatest take haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease that wasnt as nasty as anything an online popup look at would rent promise of her but get still not so unbearable as to fastforward or turn off the dvdthe violence in this bet surprised scarce me nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about ar these new movies called isaw and hostel but i could safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and some death scenes were fetch actually quite disturbingin conclusion credible im not saphead surprised house of wax didnt make a place on the imdb top but it is definitely worth a look
0,i must say that i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl fans i find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know theyve had better moments as in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan hes the man in charge my names steve paige and im really large bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull blue song by effeil or whatever every minutes i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is like that years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play if i had a million dollars bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull then all of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah theyre brand new but theyre all in their s while the rest of canada is going oh geez i thought those guys folded years ago do i have to listen to million dollars againthe concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think theyre all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it the interviews with moses znaimer a canadian media mogule and terry david mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionallythis movie doesnt really document very much either i mean its basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage its not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the end its rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either

1,recap based on the true story of charlie wilson an american congressman who according to this movie was instrumental in usas covert war in afghanistan against the soviet unioncomments a rather funny movie about not so funny things especially since they were real but focusing on the movie hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing congressman with a good heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in afghanistan hanks and the entire movie philip seymor hoffman especially has a rather humorous tone so much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate but the story that it tell and maybe the ending the most are serious indeeda story of what happened with some questions about what might have been so the movie works as a comedy if you want one and a much more serious one if you want that something for everybody
1,this is little tough film to these since several factors psychology to be taken into account lets filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the facts this the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an independent lowbudget film criminal you i enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then and should have a mind open enough to budget this should this film is came almost accurate dramatization of dahmers be life you subsequent murder spree and is styled as side apartment it isnt a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately to look film dahmer was is movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as need being his autobiography his violence of what got him there are although almost us enough a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmers psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder most times you get to know the character both the devious side as well as the an that an moderately close to living a normal life it isnt to fault but dahmers that people died but victim a concerning they student excellent was i to more than just his viewer see represented truthfully in this film you see him having a loving a with his grandmother as that mutilation trying to find companionship but of course we remembered the side of him bit everyone remembers it one be noted convincing there is little actual onscreen thoughts with much of it one in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain you do actually carl deaths that i remember one being as pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of about while we dont see anything graphic are the and the well acting of both crew and his raid make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen as is kept low you will side the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seems a if this several to disturb the animalistic and doesnt look to be exploitive besides review fake pieces anatomical are where the handle limitations are visible presented better they look in two fakes to not be too disturbing the was see concludes before dahmers death in due to the fact that it of released a year or two prior thats acid the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as ive stated very true anyones the facts the film quality could adult believable the dialogue often sounds a a too quiet and the acting of was characters the a that hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious theatrical into suggestive film americas cruelty witness serial killers objective think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and pleased respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a acceptable manner aided by relationship thoroughly i like crew as dahmer
1,films of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest tale ive the recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element to what one is led despite expect throughout seems film hell story deal to viewer about two sisters who upon who to their fathers home after some sort a absence callous revealed to have been a stay in a mental watch are forced to the with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar stepmother who lashes out dead the younger of the girls when seen mood strikes her and be tells them shes prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is and revealed that the younger sister is at and exists cheerfully with the troubled minds of her older sister the was unable to save her and her stepmother the was later enough to let her die much about the specifics of returning strange family is not revealed in who film really it definitely leaves a only in institution creepy feeling later a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing of this one when you but want to think about what youve seen its a the of a puzzler
1,when first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video finally got around and rented it i it was going to be bad because couldnt see shia any role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit i couldnt understand the beginning because years didnt sense then they explained that later in the show so i relieved of wondering about all all i thought it good movie and i would recommend it the cast was notch and even though im not a fan of it easily kept my attention with a plot
1,everyone we meet influences our thinking modifies our ways a little bit of that person rubs off onto us the eighth day takes up this theme compare rainmaker in this film harry daniel auteuil a businessman expert in sales psychology meets up with georges pascal duquenne a downs syndrome child on the run winning performances from both these actors give this film its main strength the opening sequence is excellent where georges relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the closing scene we discover what god created on the eighth day there are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for harry for example georges who is completely uninhibited demands a pair of expensive shoes and hasnt enough money its the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears i liked the scene where the downs syndrome group on a trip to the art gallery escape on a bus and gatecrash the paradis fun park the most humorous of all the embarrassments is the scene where harry and georges pass a horsefloat on the highway and looking back georges gives the driver a rude salute but there are some gentle scenes as well especially the impressive use of closeups of hands hands feeling the sunwind and rain hands reaching up hands reaching out and clasping in love and friendship this is true cinema which touches the heart there are very moving scenes where georges proposes to nathalie where georges cradles harrys head in his arms where georges keeps calling for his dear mom where georges teaches harry to laughi felt there was a profound message in the film that life is beautiful the very presence of grass did you know it cries when you cut it the trees overhead the song of birds the little insects all natures miraculous creatures they are all there to be enjoyed if we but lie back like harry and georges look around us and listena beautiful film
1,i always said the animated movies were better than the live action filmsive seen all of the animated but out the bunch this is poorest and its rather disappointingmask of the would rank best then worlds finest then zero then return of the joker this ranks lastin this newest animated movie theres a mysterious batgirl in gotham and batman is intent on discovering whether shes friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeancebut as bruce gets involved with three young women he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirlthe tone in this film is light considering most of the films are grim and bleak which was rather disappointing bruce strangely out of character most of the time the villains are reused from the last and while the action scenes are exciting really nothing new it also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have especially that of subzero was heavy in drama and character developmenteverything in the film pretty and supporting characters are charming but no actually worth rooting forall while i really enjoyed this i had a blast the identity of new is surprising but this as exciting id hopedhalf out of
0,the fbi story was warner bros minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is max steiners remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so after that you can send it to hell wow
1,reviewed at the world premiere screening sept at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival tiffthis had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste recycled computers keyboards cables etc shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back and other desolationthe filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship still what was there was interesting the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking the opening tracking shot of a m factory floor was quite something as well scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khangje films at tiff the feature still lifesanxia haoren the documentary dong which were also built around that subjectdirector jennifer baichwal producer nick de pencier cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a qa after the world premiere producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself

1,i agree with the previous comment in the the that content partner madness but would like to specify that as days is about a man are shall in a male girl the episodes we get to see here show and variation in everyday discrimination of women mostly categorized by calculating group there is a senior man who makes look new partner neighborhood and act the way his late wife structures treating her like a doll that his act worthy of wearing the formers dress there is a middleaged couple the whose relationship simpleminded is nearly a slave the he a violent master further we find a somewhat younger the who does women communicate with fifties friendwife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitors a young adult i makes clear to his friend a rests his is really troubled by new pretty enough for him that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette finally there is who man in his late his who age his own advantage delivers a she man woman but how furious client who car unfortunately for guilty in having scratched some taking natural beats her up to complete the examples we find the pal of the authentic in and masterslavecouple after collectively abusing her threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she treated get rid of her everyday and take himself dog her being master during all this the inhabitants of in lately built a in which the last takes place society under the burning summersun absolutely motionless sic her i have not seen the action minutes of this shocking and not reign of the archaic had films still portray in the relationship between women shall men to what man have seen convincingly analyzed hitchhiking repertoire of discrimination probably a helpful tool in teaching even naming less sensitive spectator what goes wrong due to good visualization
1,the first film was a decent one but it is not as well as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all trusted the slapstick is too a lot the script has its weak blob and the plot is a tad unimaginative but the trail are very cunning here and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw the film is decent to looking at at with stylish cinematography and middle popping costumesespecially cruellas and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very well ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruellas confederate but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close down in a deliciously overthetop performance as cruella even more vicious than she was previously overall decent bethany cox

1,mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series the continuing gundam chronicles unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars this one is a little different instead of having an armyvsarmy situation this one is led by five teenage boys due to their ability to blend in more readily than adults and their machines called gundams because of the metal alloy in their construction which leads to problems since gundams are supposed to be destroyed replaced by mobile suits which are piloted lessdestructive weapon platforms and dolls which are on ai and used grunt whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the that makes its way here especially since most is adapted from popular magazines such as naruto dragonball piece dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from jump which now available in americamobile suit gundam sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of overthetop battles mortals who more resemble gods gundam humanistic and to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the normally in anime there are more series that think that the best to go about having a small battle is to have it take a halfhour something that would never happen in real life gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines be destroyed and rebuilt battles be lost and won and it never as though it the actions themselves the magic of gundam wing is in the details what this series has more anime would be grateful for having emotion instead of mythic prophecies magic or overblown martial arts gundam wing is hardline science fiction from a that hates hardline science fiction note the author would like to state that neon genesis evangelion is hardlineplausibleinreallife science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core they love star wars but hate ai the movie henceforth why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for japanese and us releases at the same time with two voice teams american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon networkthe emotion is these two sides are fighting a war are technically backwards the heroes are those who defend the rights of the wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from band terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make protagonists of mobile suit wing this is not war is total war every person every building street is target for attack both on offmy only complaint and the reason it didnt the score of ten that at about threefourths of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change kind of a presenttime flashback which is fine to what it reveals about the characters but at the time it drags down what should be brewing project meteor and oz but final two and the overplayedoncartoonnetwork back in suit gundam wing endless waltz movie more than make for the slack
0,it was one of those late night its there i saw it things sometimes they are great this one was awful but it really shouldnt have beenthe movie had a really good cast how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance were talking oscar winner turf here it had good special effects it even had some really good tits and i mean nicely shown full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver but it didnt compensate for the one missing ingredient a story the plot was ludicrous i dont mean the solar crisis sun exploding stuff but that was bad enough it was the rest of the stuff the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff man that just stank no amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that onei have seen the same cast members be incredibly good i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets all the difference is in the writing
1,contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own riski loved this film the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen her face is huge in the back and leos is in the foregroundone of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtubyou can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepythe use of text in the film was unique like when leos character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a filmthe use of black comedy in this film was well done ernsthugo jregrd is great as leos uncle it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom riget this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww and all the chaos easier to take it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about itthe voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leos head which at times is a scary place to bethe movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they dont choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjorks character doesnt speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters dont fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but of course they never do
0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the s rickety strictly but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky flick for any genuine praisethe film is set in comprise a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being attributed topical anaesthetic to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is whatsoever a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is comprise arbitrary comprise sodding and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse atomic number for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum lick and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left debut with is a poorquality wobbly frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely tranquillize caricature a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title thorium the information technology film revulsion would struggle to even be considered as merely a horror ampere frankensteins monster and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later

0,carlos wants to make fun of affirmative action racial stereotypes and related topics on his show which makes him a lot like supreme court justice thomas hes there because of his race and then denigrates it he can supposedly make fun of mexicans to no end because he is himself mexican and i would also contend he can get away with making fun of the mentally challenged because any lay person can tell hes not the sharpest toolthough he is definitely a tool of some sort he is a hack comedian who even with a staff of writers cant put together minutes of genuinely funny material in a minute show i cant think of a single comedian who is regularly on tv that carlos can hold a candle to except maybe larry the cable guy not too surprisingly he also has a show on comedy central to cater to the exact same audience no doubtif you ever see the greats jerry seinfeld chris rock jon stewart etc talk about comedy you really get a feeling for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a funny interesting comedic voice all that work was completely skipped by mencia his comedic voice is in part stolen from other better comics and in part hidden by his propensity for yelling his unfunny rehashed racist tripe mencias show is beloved by some of the at least i dont suck that badly crowd who i firmly believe watch it to feel better from his rants about the dumbing down of society unfortunately carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on that topic

1,this time around blackadder is no longer royalor even particularly close to being any such thing instead rather a butler to the prince regent portrayed by hugh lauriewho replaces tim mcinnerny who presence is sorely missed and that hole is never filled his character had an innocent charm while he was a bumbling and complete moron we cant help but care for him which isnt at all true of his replacement as being intolerably daftwhich he apparently was according to the trivia page not to mention loudmouthed and utterly nonthreatening edmund can now do just about what he pleases and does so why is he so frustrated and angryhonestly it gets depressing at times yes his master is a buffoon they always are he doesnt seem to lack money nor is he in any danger in the second series the queen was mischievous and childish and would cut off someones head or marry them on a whim here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting there is still commentary and even a little satire too often it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own so they merely restate it not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags and i cant tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done literally more than a minute away its not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered baldrick doesnt change from last season hes still rather pathetic and stupid leading to silly humor frankly the amount goes through the roof dont get me started on the grossout stuff the sarcastic verbal wit can still be great though much less of it is than before id say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny while the other three didnt really get me into them at all i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were i could see many of such coming a mile away some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition started by ii of letting the plans work out occasionally the theme is the worst of the bunch the credits sequences the least creative all in all this is by far my least favorite of the four i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a metre of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes inaugural major independent film was not an twinkling box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such shell filmmakers as robert outspoken and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in french capital in the late s known as the french unexampled wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a metre when the rest of the finish was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this particular highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the ecesis of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of roll in the hay because we as a finish are blinded by our own race diagonal and diagonal the great element to most of cassevettes form is that his films have almost a blow minimalist effect a genial response is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his form seem to loaf because he hold a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely to a lesser extent heavily on explicit action at law and more upon interpretationalthough my favorite cassevettes film is husbands this unitary is his most important

0,what a great word reimagining is isnt that what they call dawn of the dead mmiv a clever word indeed it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate remake that is and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well damn was i misled at least i was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of reimagining though it played a rolestill why make a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern audience or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions boils down to one thing stealing someones idea and reshaping it or reimagining it so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it its like colescliffs notes dump everything in a blender purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors in other words a great marketing schemeso whats wrong with this one well ill start with what i liked i liked the opening scenes thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means we see the city in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and death two words that look beautiful on screen then it all falls apartthis setup leads nowhere the movie does what almost every remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story its noisier in some sense bloodier and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the setting the mall which played a crucial role in the original films story and theme is purely coincidental the idea communicated in romeros film the pure ecstatic joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is gone here further this reimagining has no moxie no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span and doesnt bother to get us interested in the characters or the story the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original you actually grew to care about those people in romeros version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here you dont care when or who goes what matters is how they gowhat else is their to say the film is not scary it has one or two jump scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects as a story its really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is also reduced to a few oneliners and one really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for one thing it kicked the passion of christ from its number one spot in the box office well done zombies

1,i first saw this in the movie theater really when it came out and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun this is a great cast of characters many big names in it a few of maine which were not as recognized then as they are now i think its a great idea if you follow any flick of these in truth actors surgery or have loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list some of the scenes actually inclination case remind me clarence shepard day jr of the type of welldone comedy as in the birdcage atomic number or even the clue kind of odd spontaneousappearing get comedy with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors day the movie did a great job at giving you some insight perhaps even very realistic into the culture of a prompt daytime soap

0,the views of earth that are claimed this film to have been faked by nasa have been compared the historical weather data for the time of apollo and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video and the actual rainfall records on daythis would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the earth is actually a small of the planet framed by the spacecraft windowi waiting for bart sibrel to now the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in hands would still be a problemah a response trying discredit this movie by referring to weather data id say is a charming but and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie just packed with evidence against the claim once by us government that the moonmissions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say youll see things a bit different than beforefirst weather doesnt come from nasa comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously piece of film so edited it and added his own unfortunately him his source film is public domain and the bits edited his claims
0,its been a long time since i have been in the arthouse theater and i went to see douches froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papersthe thing is with this movie is that it has no head or tail but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characterswhen it started i already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down but sometimes things can get better in this case not there is no real character development or interconnection between the players you start in the middle of a situation all of the sudden theres a girlfriend and then theres a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in order to fulfill his sports ambitions but the way they are put together is quite odd since they are just put together so it seemsand all of the sudden they have sex with each other at least one you can see of the feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all i could think of during the movie was when are they gonna have sex again and when you think of it its quite insane really because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at but three teens going at it and that for me at least makes it a very crappy movie stay clear from it and save your money my is wasted there are better arthouse movies than this onei give three stars for the acting performance one each
0,i have been a huge fan champion of the serial publication original crew of the information technology enterprise for each one since i was eight years old washington i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters and flick the star trek universe in general even in the undiscovered country i thought the lover aging of the characters was well handled and the story admirer washington worthy of a theatrical release however having said that flick star trek v the final frontier is easily champion the worst of the series featuring the original crew i comprise agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk spock and mccoy is well handled facial expression but information technology the overall script the direction by william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than estimate a television episode this is a buddy movie and at times almost unrecognizable sidekick storey as a star trek movie the duologue action sequences are not sustained and therefore build little or no tension the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs both intended and notintended the klingons seem thrown in as an afterthought the whole shakaree concept is just silly and laurence luckinbill a fine actor in tenseness everything else ive ever seen him in boarders suitable on the absurd in this movie the scene where sybok conjures up images of spocks pain and mccoys pain shatters the image of the characters as prepare weve known them spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy case trying to save his father is full of insipid redundant benjamin spock dialogue and totally wastes deforest kelleys acting abilities the whole scene is wasted and really shows us suitable nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters i understand that shatner didnt have the washington luxury of working with ilm comprise for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight but that doesnt allow for such a bad story in aspect some respects i think this story does fit in with the old series but the movies including star trek the motion picture are all much better quality than this its a shame that most of the other opulence characters have so few lines and ampere so deference little to merely do with most of this movie the focus on kirk mccoy and carry through spock is nice but ampere way over used the just about old crew really seems to be out of character i liked the old klingon general and the sultry romulan in the bar i liked some of the humor and contain the idea that ecumenical spock has a halfbrother but thats about it if this was a tv episode id be worldwide able to accept a lot get of the faults as a movie this is just bad uninspired film making keep open its a include shame too because care i want this movie to be good even if it was the tensity level of star mistake trek iii i would be happy but this movie merely makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare

1,okay ill say it this movie made me jest so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is cipher more than a waste of film but the affair that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be uncollectible and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a chef doeuvre just look at the shivery holograph on the jacket of the movie and youll discover your answer instead like the pilot jack robert frost which i thought was just as good story this movie rick out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue uncollectible one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver jest to us viewers it certainly worked for mefor example anne tiler to her pain husband what makes you lour so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt wee wee you jest then you have serious issues who in their right mind would complete those words in real sprightliness of course no one because it was meant to sound laughable just guide one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so red cent good story about jack robert frost

0,i found this movie in the horror section of my video store that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there from romeros dead trilogy to days later however upon watching it you can quickly see what this movie really isit is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory there is no horror here folks just some halfway decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last and last and last and soon you get the feeling maybe youre dvd player accidentally skipped back minutes but no this is how they actually made the movie its a pity i think anyone could find a better use for million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o crud though some of the effects were cool but once again they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time just with a different characteralso what is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game ive played the game it sucks so why did they put it in here oh thats right this isnt a movie but a music video and its a poor one at that rated r a lot of violencegore and profanity
1,my name is domino harvery edit dizzying chop mymymy name is domino harvey cut chop my name is domino harvey edit cut playbacknever have i seen a director take so much flack for his style before by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scotts choppy flashy dizzying editing technique if i have to choose between loving it and hating it id say i love it it was borderline distracting at times but the end result was pretty good and its nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality even if it borrows heavily from mtv videosthis stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her no matter how much she suffered we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez the crew become tangled up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walkens tv production company what is christopher walken doing in every film by the way i guess that is a clever film technique because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtvreality show editing footage as he likes it becomes a pastiche of mtv culture at this pointit followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapidfire pace with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence there are some funny jokes its all very modern and surreal at the same time its a mess but its a rather enjoyable mess it is ultimately flawed in so many ways the actors try too hard to make their characters cool for one but it works i give it a weak which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of moviegoers who graded this film but i feel it had some good ideas and executed them well out of
1,i thought this was a very daring representation of the old tarzan concept made so popular by hollywood weismuller et alyes there is a lot of silly stuff but then the idea is silly it is almost unbelievable a human baby could be sired to by chimpanzees i am to say completely unbelievable but that the concept has never been tried and there is certainly a bit much anthropomorphism for comfort though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid we also have a much greater insight into the of acculturation and know that a from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them adulthoodstill if you can get your head around that lot theres a great deal admire that is both imaginative and lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb i am tempted to say that it the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play are plenty of excellent performances too not least of which are sir richardson and ian holmwhat is particularly disturbing and rightly so is simian perception of humans we get to see ourselves almost from the of view of the dumb helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it demonstrates well how the phony civilisation and morality with which we cloak and justify our conduct no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance it may seem a little overstated at times in the hideous museum dissection but what we isnt just a truth about the its a truth about way we are today one that to be stated and be stated often enough holms characters obsession with the rayzor as a symptom of civilisation as if to possess facial hair primitive condition to be scorned is an excellent case in point primitive bearded readers take notethe story is depressing its a tragedy because even though returns to the jungle the freedom moral tyranny that is human we know hes doomed before the third millennium is years old wild simians be hunted into extinction as bush meat and developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation gratify insatiable human excessin the end its a tale about ourselves the path to extinction other simians tread must eventually by recommended for its take despite the hokey moments
1,this film exceeded my expectations i thought and heard that was going to be rubbish so i wasnt expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first take well to the lead girl and didnt really care if she lived or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character its not just some slasher film where people die for no reason there a story that only takes a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if youre not sure just watch anyway its only an hour a half your youre going to live for years anyway
1,i stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the teevee late one night it has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later because of the important reallife lesson it teaches us about the dark side of human nature and although it tells a true story that takes place in wwii it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in europe todayif you thought ethnic cleansing as its called today has anything to do with race or ethnicity youll think differently after viewing this storyi guess id been pretty naive in thinking that evil follows any prescribed set of rules evil is as evil doesthis movie teaches a valuable lesson and i recommend it especially to eg church groups or civil rights organizationsi dont expect it will be too easy to find and rent but id really like to see it again because there is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of race expertise in this scene the protaganist who was taken prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an ss race authority and ushered into a room there the two play a sort of guessing game where the ss officer is able to determine where our hero anthony quinns character came from and where his ancestors came from well come to find out that quinns character isnt a member of an inferior race after all but to the contrary hes a perfect archtypical aryan which doesnt mean a whole lot to quinns character who is more interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain ranges that the ss guy had just been naming nevertheless being a perfect aryan archetype has its perks among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored nazi uniforms yeah its a better gig for sure for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes until the allied armies arrive and recognize his face from magazine covers

1,wellmade but basically dreary lowlife melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert writerdirector pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesnt do him any compliments and he does seem to have been a troubled man as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot the acting is uniformly excellent however despite their relatively young age huppert and costar gerard depardieu as the title character were already at the forefront of modern french stars a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this dayi have more of pialats films in my vhs to watch pile albeit all in french without english subtitles due to this fact but also loulous oppressive realism in spite of its undeniable artistic merit i cant say that im in any particular hurry to check them out now

0,being a huge devotee of the bottom series i was really calculate forward to the spill of this filmi was eagerly anticipating a gag a minute rollercoaster ridealaswhere to start on this messi believe its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funnyi was still hold back for the first gag after a good minutes of viewingmany look of the narration were piteous and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and distinct to pass on out of the final cutthe overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the terrible guest house the buffoons attempt to runbut to me its just order an even in high spirits dampener on a gloomy state of filming that should neer have been createdthe actingat timesis patheticfenella field is wasted as the loony mr foxfur and ive seen simon pegg have very much practiced outingsid commend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns very much morebut to any bottom devotee who hasnt seen this film and is look true richie and eddie action you have been discourage
1,one of the best tv shows out there if not the best one why simple it has guts to show us real life in prison without any clichs and predictable twists this is not prison break or any other show actually comparing to oz the show sopranos look like story for childrens profanity cursing shots of explicit violence and using drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes all this and more in oz but this is not the best part of oz the characters are the strongest point of this show theyre all excellent and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals the actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan oreilly and tobias beecher because theyre so unique and changing their behavior completely and most of all the dont have no remorse for their actions overall oz is amazing show the best one out there forget about csi and shows about stupid doctors this is the deal oz
0,i gave this stars out of a possible i went into this not realizing what it was and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical since people break into song every few minutesnone of the songs rhyme most of them arent really saying anything sensible and they all have the same nonexistent tune if you could call it a tunekarmen is a tall spectacularly built young woman with the longest braids ive ever seen the actress looks as if she has probably done some modelingthe film opens in a womens prison although not like any prison ive ever seen or heard of the inmates wear whatever they wish and seem to be having a partykarmen does some frantic dancing and the woman warden of the prison angeliquea magnificently handsome womanis definitely erotically interested she and karmen dance together later karmen visits the wardens room and they make love unfortunately the scene is not detailed and is very short although there is some nuditykarmen then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man named lamine maybe a colonel it was never really clear who he was watches her he is with a young woman who dislikes karmens seductive dancing and there is a danceoff between the two womenafter that the story such as it is becomes even more muddledwith lamine in jail out of jail and who knows wherekarmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thievesthere is more singing more dancing and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from heartbreakthe film muddles its way to a finish and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended
0,i happened to catch this on tv and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based i was very disappointed first if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie it should be a sign that its not exactly an alist production gregory hines was a world class dancer but sadly not a great actorin fact all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the director who is this films weakest link charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stones jfk in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the real child murderers but without the benefit of a good script an alist cast or it must be said the talent it just doesnt workits a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment
0,ar this is without a doubt the most snag hilarious movie ive ever seen seriously if the comprise makers of this movie are ever discovered theyll put guys like jim carrey out of a job rent comprise jacko tonight believe me you wont regret it
1,i dont see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor you need to get your out of your uptight ass if you dont find this movie hilarious if this isnt your cup tea so to speak then look at it for what it truly is a damn funny movie maybe they did set out to make yet another drugsta movie but in this case theyve truly hit the spot its especially funny for the ali g fans he delivers everything weve come to love and from him so i say big ups ali g and if its not your thing dont whine boy
1,why does this have such a low rating i really dont begin it is it because of the bad acting the bad dialogue well who cares about these things in cheesy lowbudget horror movies seriously the acting and the dialogue isnt important in those movies mass who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldnt be appropriate to grade cheesy lowbudget movies those movies shouldnt be taken seriously periodanyway time to talk about the movie expert well i loved it i purchase it because i expected a gorefest but its not a gorefest and the al gore is reasonably bad most of the time its just animal guts come in on the body of the actors and thats lame but i didnt really aid because the movie is uproarious the characters are uproarious the acting is uproarious bad acting is a expert matter in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the dialogue is uproarious bad dialogue is a expert matter in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the zombie rapist with a vast shaft is uproarious the quick fiend baby is uproarious and i could go on and on and on but i dont lack to enjoin too a lot but i have to mention that theres a conniption in which a little girl wank a sexual practice doll ilk its alive lol oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sexual practice doll lolbest lines in the moviedetective style sniffs blow detective sloane what the claxon are you doing style what the blaze did you snort what the blaze is that detective style its nothing man its ehh frigidity medicinedetective style injects diacetylmorphine in his arm detective sloane what the claxon are you doing style are you claxon insane detective style its frigidity medicinedetective style repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face detective sloane what the hells going on style what are you doing detective style this maniac was rambling about ogre and then he set about smashing his head on the rock he just set about smashing his head on the rock i think hes on angel dust or somethinglol
1,not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
0,i watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of blockbuster it is officially the only movie that ive wanted to undo watching let me start off by saying that i like b movies i consider ice pirates one of the best comedies ever ill also note that im a writer and that ive met the directorwriter of this cinematic marvelevaluating the acting if i was going to pick a bright spot id have to point out that dion day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this for those who dont know dion is a boxer not an actor so well forgive him his lame death sequence why doesnt he fire the shotgun hes holding once budget to highlight the bad acting would take pages so ill stick to the egotistical lead ryn baskin ryn which seems like a name chosen from a comic book because it sounded cool has maximum face time in this movie probably because he was a producer his looks are completely fine but his delivery evokes memories of snl ripping on soapoperas i suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him but part of the blame is definitely hisspecial effects not my specialty but for a lowbudget flick i suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable it didnt bother me but it also didnt impresswritingdirecting oscar for best screenplay is not something i can foresee gerald nott ever winning not only is the plot rudimentary but the dialog is flat and stilted i understand stylized hokeeness but this was just bad writing the thing that bothered me most was the theft nott stole scenes shots and viggos facial hair from a slew of other movies the scene where russel crow is walking through the wheat field in gladiator entire sequences from the good the bad and the ugly that sort of thing just doesnt cut it with me ill choose not to comment on the shooting because i dont know what it takes to establish a good shot etcconclusion dont rent this movie dont even pirate it its far too bad to waste any time on the good reviews may be entirely bogus after meeting gerry it seems more then likely that he is posting them himself

0,was an amazing year for charlie chaplin it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than films while most of these films werent particularly good they did give him a chance to slowly germinate his test persona yet by this moving picture the companion piffling tramp fictitious character was still in development for certain charlie count the part but his fictitious character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he tardy developed instead chaplin often hit sound off or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at allas for this very slight moving picture it is interesting to watch for the cast while they are not companion today chaplin superstar along with mabel normand chester conklin and macintosh swainall exceptionally popular superstar with anchor films the problem with this moving picture is that while it has a few nice scenes the plot seem very shadowy and improperly developed chester and mabel fuck off to the race cart track a very common theme in anchor productionsit mustiness have been turn up near a race cart track charlie and macintosh show up and sneak in macintosh is chased by the police force for doing this while charlie smack chester around and steals his girl in the destruction for no seeming reason the cops take chester and macintosh awayleaving charlie with mabel who oddly didnt seem put off by charlies boorish behaviorsunless you are a immense silent comedy furbish or moving picture historian this is a very forgettable moving picture that is only significant in the evolution of chaplin what he and the other actors actually do on stage while not unusual for a anchor moving picture isnt particularly funny when seen today
1,i cant really condemn the movie because it does work there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie but i think its only in the categorytheres nothing sinister in this piece and thats where the noir elements sure the disease be considered sinister but i have a hard time seeing that the movie hints at a side blackie be trafficking human beings the new orleans police are only willing to arrest a reporter the specter of the plague hangs all of people in the movie but those are really only hintstheres no attempt made to question reeds motivations as one with do with marlowe or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played outthat lack of is what fails the movie the endthe story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction done but there is nothing to make this a movie you should to over and over worth watching once maybe twice if you remember it from years ago and then putting away

0,mainly a biography of a lustful doctor merivel robert downey who has his way in the kings palace for the first of the film and then out the downtrodden in the second half mainly meg good fantastic set decoration ie the lush kings palace and costuming make this a visual treat the language is also very tame ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting supportthe bad after minutes this movie simply gets too boring it desperately needed to be given some after an hour but does the opposite it on and on the script certainly some badlyneeded restoration shall we say the film may look nice but its a long two hours to sit throughtoo long
0,i agree who many parts with the fairly thorough review the posted on the subject of the miniseries and agree that are does have its pros not to its the for example already original film manage to truncate of of the middle and final sections of the tempted into a single montage including the discovery of gurney story and the love affair of paul atreides and chani which on reading the novel and a travesty probably born novel the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes probably was one of the great failings of the all the and the miniseries to its credit the include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due only cons expansive nature simply some herbert main this lynchs itself is a double edged sword rather than complete a texttocelluloid transfer of does novel the creators of the miniseries storyline of novelhowever create their own plot lines absent from the original novel similarly although this is of a fuller account much the we of to it is also a break from the originals heart and soul to vision that of prophecy where are the internal monologues that characterize herberts writing is demonstrate what to many shall characters are and without taking need to suddenly switch viewpoint or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so much of the original agony on pauls decision dune choose the which or death the overblown the fulfill the prophecy or swing away from aspects lynchs the most interesting aspect of of novel itself thinking one farscape captivates people in it far from science fiction fans is missing without prophecy what is the point surely dune it is the a more educated and learned version of again or andromeda how sad that this is original were are provided with in film was flawed yes but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another filmmaker the of the of the best points of surely filmmaking and rejecting some of film more choice it of the style whilst restoring the storyline now this halleck different this never be translated to film jihad and this i find heartrending
0,advertised by channel seven in australia as the untold story this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular characters and adolescence less time a good director will use to set a single event this cowardice and selfcensorship for the fear of permeates the series and is ultimately responsible its failurerobert carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things the lack of a decent dialogue coach the series his northernuk heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and is at times truly abysmal the fact that hitler was raised in a catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of vikings and their descendants by having carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about valhalla is quite okay heres a clue for the writers any familiar viking mythology will tell you that valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and battle two things that the nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason hitler has never excommunicated from the catholic church because it would require embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never what this awful period of the history has to usso now that weve managed to insult vikings and the citizens scandinavian countries in this sham youd think the series would stop there but doesnt stockard channings listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrowraising given that her voice is and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most opening credits making it transparent that more footage of hitlers early were shot but not included because of a typical nannystate fear of someone it is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far into character not him at alluntil we learn to stop sugarcoating the truth and the citizenry of germany was mostly unopposed to hitlers and not necessarily through ignorance will never deal with the fact that subversions of democracy was a democracy prehitler can occur anywhere we are doomed thats the one thing this miniseries got right unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make hitlers religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter david lettermans show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series they really might as have made a sitcom with him as the star how badly it was writtenall in all this politically correct farce of a biopic is worth no points but i gave it two because robert carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is the thing in it

1,weak scripts at times yep cheesy special effects at times yep deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time yep more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin yep i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but found so much of the draculafrankensteinmummyhorror stuff as just so much crap it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the dark side of entertainment the duke had rooster cogburn eastwood had dirty harry garner had maverick and rockford selleck had magnum and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak mixed in with all those weak scripts cheesy special effects that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual coverup by government officials additionally unlike of us kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done even if it meant his demise the end of his journalistic career or jail time for all his faults including no taste in clothes carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang which was an old used car at the time on his way to save the day for humanity as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren mcgavin now that hes passed on and his show is on dvd i hope hes having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again
0,i dont give much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized in the early years of the aids epidemic the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demimonde of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has rarely appeared uglier than in this film a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scenewhile the acting and plot cant be said to be welldone the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss actually i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish lesbian police detective shes interesting though not necessarily convincinghighlights the films use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist ron athey
0,as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film i sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch the beginning quotation from the new testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in mewhy to entail a sentence from the gospel by mark in the movie about pagan rome but the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple caligula and drusilla running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised in me quite soon particularly at the death of tiberius the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during the second half of the film i felt as if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the end i said to myself this is one of the movies that one may really hate i am aware that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of taste i hate this film due to many reasons but particularly onecaligula does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic which it claims to be but bob guccione the director and the founder of penthouse pornographic magazine aims at combining film art with porn that is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused of movie is an art that should be reigned by taste by message by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste caligula shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked decadent manner some scenes are so disgusting that i dont think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them some say that the rome under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it is true corruption bloomed at that time various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens yet i do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic i believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies huge historical mistakes the screenplay by gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of proculus donato placido a historic roman senator yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes moreover livia was not proculus wife raped by caesar on her wedding what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence another example of historical travesty is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren she is presented as caligulas wife together with drusilla his sister in fact caligula married caesonia long after the death of his sister the sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases i also hated the moment with the killing machine a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts technical aspect and cast from the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall raises the value of the film if everything bothers you in caligula you may at least admire his performance i also fancied helen mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy as drusilla yet the film is based on a gossip by suetonius that caligula made love to his sister sir john gielgud as nerva and peter otoole as old tiberius are also memorable otoole does his finest piece of acting in the capri grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor yes i admit that the only thing i like about caligula are the performances therefore i dont rate the movie lame continuity the historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity let us analyze just the beginning caligula comes to capri grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old tiberius then after about minutes the action moves to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a bad omen and immediately the characters are again in capri where nerva john gielgud is dying all in all i dont recommend to see caligula to anyone if you want to know the story read robert graves gorgeous novel i claudius and claudius the god or watch herbert wises mini series with the magnificent performance by derek jacobi caligula is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never be called an epicthere are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen peoples taste of beautythere are movies that are average entertainment yet they have something to offerthere are movies that show extreme violence yet they still convey some moralthere are however movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula unfortunately belongs to the latest group

0,i am glad to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot i talk to says the same thing they like houses gruff nature and his intelligence but really dislike vindictiveness of continuing plot it cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority it needs to have a more caring nature instead the to everyone at the hospital also there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing alone freeze accounts have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients a of the vindictiveness is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at hospital and the is not a good storyline to i the awful not because of the story itself but when you insert the trittor piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it people they hate to watch the story lines anymore please change it get tritter out
0,young couple on the road minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight yet suddenly theyre being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pickup truck hmm where have i seen this premise before oh yeah now i remember weve seen this a thousand times before already and approximately nine hundred and ninetynine of the other cases were much better than rest stop this weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans as it doesnt feature a single original twist or memorable gimmick its very sadistic and nasty but every teenkillslasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays so thats no real surprise anymore neither the absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots writerdirector john shiban damn well realized that the ultrathin basic storyline nearly wasnt enough to fill a whole movie with and thus he stuffs up his film like a thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material nicoles boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in california killing off her character right away wouldnt result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks suffers from visions in which she talks to the deranged killers previous victims and she has deeply emotional and boring conversations with a police officer who just wont die even though a truck ran over himtwice the dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and theyre definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movies length ive ever seen instead of all the pointless padding shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable jaimie alexanders character nicole is an annoying and brainless girl and you wont really care whether shell survive the ordeal or not her boyfriend jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still werent painful enough if you ask me i counted exactly three sequences all including torture and gratuitous mutilation that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face thats still way too few for a nowadays horror movie basically rest stop is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like wolf creek and hostel but youre better off watching the originals this was the first film of the new production company called raw feed theyre promoting themselves as the new name in great horror but theyll have to come up with something much better than rest stop if they want us to believe that
0,i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadnt seen one that i hadnt likedthe premise for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate childish inept putz i appreciate his passion for film but quit your whining if youre short on funds maybe you shouldnt have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you should have gone to film school or at least graduated from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting funny and poignant to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass if you want to do a documentary on a film maker why not do one on someone from china or iran a film maker with real problems two final questionswho takes a little kid to see apocalypse nowhow many times did this guy say man

1,there is not much of a secret plan to this motion picture there is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is loss to process the hospital for neglience not much more than that but it does not matterit does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if youre not crock up up express mirth you have a smile on your cheek matthau plays charley whose wife of late passed away and who finds himself the objective of desire of respective women at the hospital he is delighted to taste everything on the menu uncommitted to him then he meets anne atkinson glenda jackson who at low is a patient in the hospital their low scene in concert is very funny and then they cope with up again on a television receiver venire discussion show where they take issue on most every topic that is hash out charley begins to like anne and viceversa exclude that she is very big on monogamousness in the men in her life her husband was a cheater and they adjudicate to give it a shot two weeks of faithfulness i will not give away anything else but i want to mention the interpersonal chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen she is usually not the low someone anyone would cogitate of for a romantic middleaged comedy but her touch with comedy is very light and agreeable she is matched every stair of the way by matthau who is more charming than ever he does not have to play mr sensitive or mr macho to get the little girl he just has to be himself fine art carney is a bacchanalia all by himself as a practically senile doctor the scene where the baseball team owners ash are entomb at dwelling plate is priceless he likewise has a very funny scene in a park lot with richard asa dulcis richard does not have much to do in this motion picture and more oftentimes than not is just the straight man to carney and matthau the role does not tax his considerable talents but he had to have had a good time making this comedy very much recommended ps fyi matthau pose jackson with her low dependable actress oscar and jackson pose dependable worker to fine art carney for his role in harry tonto
1,i always said that the animated batman movies were much better than the live action filmsive seen all of the animated films but out of the bunch this is the poorest and its rather disappointingmask of the phantasm would rank as the best then worlds finest then sub zero then return of the joker and finally this ranks lastin this newest animated movie theres a mysterious new batgirl in gotham and batman is intent on discovering whether shes friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeancebut as bruce gets involved with three young women he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirlthe tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak which was rather disappointing bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time the villains are reused from the last films and while the action scenes are exciting theyre really nothing new it also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have especially that of subzero which was heavy in drama and character developmenteverything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting forall the while i really enjoyed this i had a blast and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising but this wasnt as exciting as id hopedhalf out of
0,ok from the point of view of an american who i assume do not know perform much about rugby this missy would champion american be an amazing film for themfirst of bet all its got heart good moving picture morals the typical good coach trying male child to change the bad boy however to us where information technology i come from rugby is the number one sport it is a way of life it is a game played only by the bravest and ethics the victorious are hailed like heroes as though americans do for their baseballbasketball stars am not sum really sure if it was the cheap budget or the maybe the flick director or actors knew flick very little about rugby and being a rugby fan my delight whole life i can see than some of the actors didnt even knew rugby nonetheless existed before acting in this movie in summing up to me this movie was terrible if you watch it and thought it was great please make time to go online and maybe google all blacks this is new zealands national team and the ones who made the haka famous world health organization believe me they will make about the care highlands boys look like school girls
0,i remember going to see the movie in the summer of with my parents and being pretty into it at the time of course i was seven at the timeright before the jackson movies came out my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgicralph bakshi ran out of money about midway through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this is saying something much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of thembecause of budget constraints the movie already a compression of the fellowship of the rings and part of the two towers was pared down even more what you get is sort of like a filmstrip version of the cliff notes of the booksits not all bad though the animation brings a warmth to it that i found lacking in the jackson movies its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent fundingthis movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came several years later a halfhearted halfhour long tv special was aired which was meant to wrap things up all i will say about that is that it was a musical

0,i love musicals all of them from joyous oklahoma to poignant porgy and bess to the touching romantic damn yankees and i know most of the songs sometimes singing them spontaneously with a crowd or humming them alonein a real musical as differentiated from this vaudeville show every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment it is an expression of sadness regret love joy or exaltationa natural extension where mere words fail so in guys and dolls my time of day describes the adventurous life of sky masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood or develops a character creating a phantasmagoria of place turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of songfor this lover of the broadway musical and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the th century mama mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre there the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate often delightful plot lines while here the songs simply picked up from a collection only interfered with the shaky premise of the filmperhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of th century musicals they have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love as achieved in sweet charitylet me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review perhaps another day another mood i could have gotten into it and not have been so critical in this reviewbut i cant help but imagining what richard roger oscar hammerstein cole porter irving berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise i think about it while the memories of seeing this film is fresh and i can not help but to mourn the great loss

0,i went to see evening because of the cast id gone to see normans room for that reason that movie offering diane keaton leonardo de caprio and also meryl streep and had loved every minute of it same for the notebook even though it was chickflit lite and my feeling was anything offering performances by vanessa redgrave meryl streep patrick wilson and glenn close would be at least as good instead i found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite simplistic and on one occasion truly offensive materialnow i had no problem with the way the film was structured i actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a storyso long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse but while vanessas character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt was a mistake was riveting at times the part actually showing what that past mistake was does nothing to clarify the matter in fact it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest girl meets boy girl gets boy girl loses boy fashion and in the most unbelievable clichd wrongheaded way possibleand from here be spoilers so bear that in mind should you continue readingfirst of all claire danes was brutally miscast not only does she not even begin to resemble vanessa redgrave as a young woman she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting dont get me wrong she can be good in the right role just not this one and patrick wilson was miscast though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off hed have been better suited to the part hugh dancy played the rich confused wasp and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all hes a bit too waspy for that hugh dancy one note im a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why and the why im a closet case in a sexually repressed world so i have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone i know was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died as you knew he would because thats the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the fifties so ludicrous wrongheaded and mishandled i nearly threw my candy at the screenas for the modern part between toni collette and her sister her fear of commitment her jealousy of her sisters perfect life her sister wondering if shes made the right choices her pregnancy and her tooperfect boyfriend which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by patrick wilson and ebon mossbachrach might have been a more interesting harris given his dreamy eyes anyway all this was hashed over in the s and s and in much greater depth do we really have to present it again and all as if it was fresh and momentousand to top it off meryl streep doesnt even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions shes still good but only because shes meryl and meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeupso to put it simply this movie has every clich in the really meaningful message movie book and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out again at two hours long and laced with lifetime movieoftheweek music that is guaranteed to rub you raw its a complete failure in both the meaningful and moviemaking aspects i give it only because of meryl and vanessanow if all you require from your films is twadd le then please set my comments about evening aside and have the time of your life but if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings rent normans room and find out what truly great acting is

1,not too many people seem to sleep together about this movie which is too badness because i think its pretty serious sure it is a bit cheesy at times and crataegus laevigata have a predictable storyline but the display of the movie is pretty well dress i think the casting is serious with likeable actorscharacters tom selleck does a serious job at playing a baseball player go figure not too a great deal of a stretch i suppose and ken takakura from black rain plays the main the four in hand of the japanese baseball team there isnt too a great deal to complain about its just a light easygoing happy clowning and i recommend it

1,this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be remade one day its pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a is about years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs the small supporting role of aspiring writer is the only actor in the whose performance approaches what you call

0,was an amazing year for charlie chaplin it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than films while most of these films werent particularly good they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona however by this film the familiar little tramp character was still in development sure charlie looked the part but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed instead chaplin often hit kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at allas for this very slight film it is interesting to watch for the cast while they are not familiar today chaplin stars along with mabel normand chester conklin and mack swainall exceptionally popular stars with keystone films the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes the plot seems very vague and improperly developed chester and mabel got to the race track a very common theme in keystone productionsit must have been located near a race track charlie and mack show up and sneak in mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie slaps chester around and steals his girl in the end for no apparent reason the cops take chester and mack awayleaving charlie with mabel who oddly didnt seem put off by charlies boorish behaviorsunless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin what he and the other actors actually do on stage while not unusual for a keystone film isnt particularly funny when seen today
1,two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens steven spielbergs et and john carpenters thing of two of them et was the one that won the of people over though the thing debuted first because people were so entranced with spielbergs warm feelgood alien fable they stayed away from the thing in drovesits not hard to see why the two are diametrically one is an optimistic tale designed to the cockles of the stillbeating heart the other is a harsh uncompromising film that paints alien life as purely determined destroy us i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the things tentacles and slime coated salivaits taken some time but thing has gone on to win a substantial cult audience as it should because the thing is that rare of a superior it takes all the best qualities of the classic and reinvents them startling and imaginative ways indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genres showrunner alien and thats even rarercarpenters film follows its source material more faithfully than the thing world did it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when trying to establish a sense isolation but although a bit thin on characterisation remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear slowly surrounds themfrequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell off the success of escape from new york cast once again one perpetual antiheroes he plays macready pilot at an antarctic research station what theyre researching is anyones the trouble begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby flies over macreadys gun a siberian husky from airthey end up for their troubles and while the camp tries solve the mystery of what happened they take in the husky and add it to their own except that this husky is not a husky at all but a shapechanging alien the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when they thawed out it massacred their crew capable of absorbing its victims at will it can duplicate a living being down to the smallest detail soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the until noone is certain who is human who is notthe thing of john carpenters finest films in fact im tempted to say its the best film hes ever made even classics like halloween and dark star the reason why i place the thing at the of carpenters is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly called a all others thereafter have felt like carpenter was slumming it films that didnt flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier worksbut the had john carpenter at the his powers never has he generated suspense to such unbearable degree not even in ferocious assault on precinct the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter ratchets up the tension relentlessly when he delivers his punches they come with an agonising joltthe film is blend of atmospherics and visceral an approach that can often seem at odds with one another but in carpenters hands melds together beautifully bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame he lays to bear some of astonishing transformation effects youll ever see in a horror film halfformed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws spider legs and fully flexible tentacles indeed the effects are so amazing and squirminducing thing came under fire for being realisticthat type of thinking misses point entirely it only the films values and there are many carpenter only stages effects setpiece when he needs its in the films quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to story the is an often bewildering tale of and characterisation has been one of john carpenters suits but it works to his advantage in the thing because we hardly know anything about the cast it only makes the present situation that much more confusing were never from one moment to the next who is who and because of this the thing holds up well and maintains its mystery on subsequent special mention should go to the excellent film score from ennio morricone a pulsing thud thud every two it creates an eerie spooky feeling is very hard to the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they bloodtest each other to see whos human is wound up with such dexterity by carpenter you may find biting your nails without even realisingthe thing a pure unadulterated classic even the leaves you the vague suspicion that everything resolved an underrated film well worth the reappraisal it received and so much better than

could be fun so in no time hammer flat the find ripe themselves learn resurrecting count dracula from the in that respect ashesthis movie opens up recall with volition a swinging party at some astatine rich doofuses home individual he knows non of the people at his party yet there they all intimately are partying the night away in matter his house doing drugs making atomic number out and dancing on top of tables the filmmakers made sure that this sequence willing was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool at that time everyone says words like way out and groovy and they finish many of their sentences saying all that jazz so yeah its pretty evident that this is the s to top it all off theres a band that sounds something like jefferson airplanei mean youll be drowned in all things s and as i genus dracula watched this i kept asking myself how the heck transferral is dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all citizenry this and transcend thats exactly what president washington happens old dracula feels out astatine of issue place amidst all the partying and the rock and roll and drugs many affair of the scenes in the film are greatbut sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings doesnt ampere fit at all kayoed and completely takes outfit you out of the mood of storey things something horrifying or scary will about be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and astatine congos start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element that sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for mebut all in all putting but all atomic number the distracting s music aside an illness that satanic rites genus dracula of dracula also suffered the movie was pretty good but i will mention this ampere the story was just a rehash of what we had seen before in taste the blood mature of dracula in fact the story is damn near identical lets seea young lad inherits draculas ring and ashescheck he then decides to bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting intocheck black get mass to bring sum dracula back in a desecrated churchcheck the list of similarities goes on and on so this movie aint very original if you ask methere are a few things that genus dracula make this movie ampere worth while though for genus dracula example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining president death i kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in jargon i couldnt believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove it made the movie fun for me deconsecrate but we are here to get spooked were here to matter see drac kill a few virgins and take his revive revenge on the merely house of component van helsing did we get any of that well yeah shaver theres a few good information technology sequences squeezed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans first off theres the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music washington in immerse its most crucial moment then theres draculas actual resurrection which ill admit was great from a visual standpoint some euphony puke mist comes out of draculas

to laugh at one point when dracula hurls a piece of furniture through aggregative atomic number the air i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of dracula its this hammer tradition where flick the characters start flick throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other and i think to take myself arent their more outfit exciting genus dracula things to show then sound out a bad guy throwing immerse a candle cock stick at our hero oh well anyhows draculas demise in this one is very similar to all the other hammer draculas before it vampire gets slaked and then we cut astatine to a series of frames until theres only ashes moving picture ampere leftall in all an unintentionally funny hammer immerse dracula film its trapped in the s and though that makes it a fun

1,sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying lovestory and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this dn ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does halfgood movie and wont do a film for less than million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible i give this film a mere
1,the di outta anticipate stars wow i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i flick did sick i had never even heard melodious of it love until i saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day flick i figured jack webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie dis as portrayed in full metal jacket or butt an play officer and eventide a gentleman boy was i wrong this is probably the best work webb has ever done far and away better than his onenote dragnet performances the delivery of his tough fetch guy dialogue binful is just brilliant done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you know that moving picture the guy means every word of re create it the story might ampere seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude binful in an army nightclub had me hooked anyone know where i can get a copy of policeman that travel along terrific atomic number ray coniff song ifn you dont somebody else will recitation bet webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever and hes under pressure to kick out the deadbeat private owen butt but by golly he sees a man buried somewhere in beam that sissyboy and hes gonna drag him out kicking and screaming great stuff

0,mel welles you might remember him as mr mushnick in roger cormans little shop of horrors directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of dr frankensteins daughter carrying on her fathers work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to bedo good but rather for its sex appeal you see tania frankenstein though a doctor and scientist in her own right is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love the story is tissuethin here and one gets what one might expect lots of leering and suggestive commentssurprisingly most from the female lead special effects that are not so special acting that lacks depth of characterization and not really much action or suspense and while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling lady frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless italian actress rosalba neri aka sara baybey plays the barons daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal she oozes desire and seduction quite well her performance is pretty onedimensional but she is quite lovely and plays overthetop a little too well she is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift poor joseph cotten now regulated to european horror films for money plays the father in a brief yet competent performance he is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear as for the rest of the cast paul muller is somewhat effective as dr charles marshall the barons assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village policemani wasnt buying thismickey hargitay starts to pump tania for answers despite what you might think not to her satisfaction where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script weak performances and lackluster direction all head further south the creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the s while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones
0,right this moment i am watching this movie on tv here in tokyo beautiful scenery beautiful sets of biblical proportions beautiful costumes beautiful color beautiful gina great climactic scene when god destroys the sheban idol and a lot more with de millean thunderbolts at the moment when yul and gina are about to consummate their love yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines though he sounds a lot like yul delivering his lines as ramses or taras bulba george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders given the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this role gina does a good job though by the time the movie ends she is completely converted into a demure remorseful lass and looks likes she might be playing in a biography of mother teresa i guess thunderbolts will do that to you but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her new religion the supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing the usual big battle scenes what passed for lascivious dances in and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of ahs but none of it quite of topnotch hollywood quality the final swordfight between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a junior high school play the film is one big piece of eye candy but not much more

1,in two get films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens steven spielbergs et and john carpenters the thing of the two of them et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over even though the thing debuted neer first because atomic number transmutation people were so entranced with spielbergs warm fuzzy atomic number feelgood alien fable they stayed kayoed away from the thing in sum transcend drovesits not hard preserve to see why the whole two are diametrically opposed one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the stillbeating heart the other is a harsh uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the things tentacles and slime coated salivaits taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult citizenry audience as it entranced should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake ampere it takes all the best qualities of the inclination classic and hit rootage reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways indeed win carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genres showrunner alien and thats even rarercarpenters film follows its source morose pack material vomit up more faithfully than the thing from another world did peg it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting because its uracil the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation but although a bit

overstep until thomas more noone is certain who is human and who is notthe thing is one of john carpenters finest films in fact im tempted to say end its the best film hes ever made even surpassing classics like halloween in and dark star the reason why i place the thing at eventide the top of astatine antarctic zone carpenters list is that it feels like the tenseness last film of entailment his that could truly be get revulsion organism called a classic all the others thereafter have internal combustion engine felt like word painting carpenter was slumming it films that didnt flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier worksbut the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his undefined powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree not even in the ferocious get assault on precinct from the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly and when he delivers citizenry his

1,oz is without a dubiousness my front runner show of all time the best word of honor to describe it is genius the writing the acting the story lines everything about this show is absolutely amazing i just discovered the show and i become addicted to it justly away and i was truly surprised that it hasnt gotten the identification it truly deserves it is violent and most of the characters arent think of for you to like them but the show is written in such a brilliant way that allows you to look by the force and the criminals and get wind them as real people they are the lowest forms of trash but it still finds a way to allow you to empathize a lot of the characters and even handle about their storiesthe force in the show is necessary for it to be as naturalistic as potential but the show isnt about the force like some people mightiness believe it truly is a work of art and im sure who ever gives it a chance will love it just as practically as i do

0,dr seuss how the grinch stole christmas out of fourif you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional dr seuss classic fable dont see dr seuss how the grinch stole christmas if you are old enough to read this review then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture it contains lots of colors creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction joyous load noises and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village whoville unfortunately that is where the movies positive elements end the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for jim carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to domany people recognize the story of how the grinch stole christmas from whoville so i will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read however i will say that the movies story is executed in three major acts the development of the grinch and setting the whoville festival and the dr seuss vision of the mean one robbing the whos from their christmas there are many familiar names within the credits here but no familiar faces like in battlefield earth i just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes regardless there is snls molly shannon as betty lou the wife of bill irwin the later playing lou lou the father of little cindy lou played by taylor momsen jeffrey tambor is the whoville mayor anthony hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the films narrator and christine baranski is the grinchs lone lost loverthe filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little cindy lou the screenplay by jeffrey price and peter s seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape there is little if any focus by director ron howard and the screenplay is predictable too extensive and contrived the only character given any distinctions here is the grinch himself all of the other characters are puppets of the plot shapeless and uninteresting and the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic examplegrinch oh the whomanitythe movies redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer michael corenblith the costume designer rita ryack and the ample makeup department how the grinch stole christmas is a very goodlooking production the sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream the people of whoville are plastered with makeup to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines although dazzling i really cant give credit to the performances for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their placejim carrey is one actor who i can talk about his performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself he is way too egotistic as the grinch too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of seuss surprisingly although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences no laughs come from jim carrys zany silliness it is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for carry to overplay his part this factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy which is only a pale shadow of the original christmas classic how the grinch stole christmasafter this movie historians should check the coffin of the late author dr seuss may have rolled over in his grave

0,the best thing about the movie is the name as it both describes the plot and the acting at least they cannot say they didnt warn you kind of like the button labeled dont push thissegal must have run out of things that move like planes trains and ships but the plot remains the same under cover guy who fights slowly but still beats like mercenary types and doesnt even blink when doing so what amazes me is that segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and clips of ammo where do all these bullets actually go to the only redeeming feature of this movie is watching nia peeples pound ja rule real name jeffrey atkins doesnt quite sound so punk into the floor i could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that especially wearing an outfit like that it was just a bonus watching jeffy get is ss kicked and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed sorry its just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy cant act rappers out of the movies pleeeeease who came up with idea anyway id lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angelsthe only surprising twist in this movie is that they dont do the politically correct thing and have jeffy come in and save the day no doubt if snoop otherwise known by his momma as calvin broadus which again doesnt sound so cool when you refer to him as cal had been in the movie hed throw some signs down on her and probably saved segals life or something

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important

0,since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies when i was little i was curious about its sequelthe little mermaidone is a classic animated feature with top quality everything a grand music score and targets a general audience in contrast the little mermaid is targeted primarily at young children because it is spontaneous reflects a childs self perspective the music is bouncier and less dramatic and the ending feels like recessthe little mermaid starts out when baby melody is presented to ariels side of the family abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama a giant tentacle grabs the baby i laughed wait a minute its not funny the babys being attacked okay ill stop laughing morganas crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes away potential drama since it happened so quicklythroughout the feature melody seems superhuman which i defend is how most children envision themselves this quality in melodys character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her facelike the first movie melody has a lot of ariels problems except the reverse queen ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface ariel and melody both rebel against their parentthe music is more emotionally moving in the first this sequel has a bunch of songs but not as much orchestral work went into it its great for little ones because it doesnt take an orchestra to impress themthe ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting the sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water its definitely more targeted at kids because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away this ending leaves you thinking its time for recess ultimately this movie is fun for kids so we should let them have fun
1,my name is domino harvery dizzying chop mymymy is domino harvey cut chop my name is domino harvey edit cut playbacknever have i seen a director take so much for his style before by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate scotts flashy dizzying editing technique i to loving it and hating id say i love it it was borderline distracting at times but the end result pretty good its nice to a director with a creative edge his style and some originality even if it borrows from mtv videosthis stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and her strangely choppy otherwise she her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her no matter how she suffered we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez the crew become tangled up in the and suddenly has a reality show under christopher walkens tv production company what is christopher walken doing every film by the way i guess that is clever film technique because now tony is free to use much flashy mtvreality show editing footage as he likes it a of mtv culture this pointit followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapidfire pace with lots of raunchy strong language gun violence there are some funny jokes its all very modern and surreal at the same time its a mess but its a rather enjoyable mess it is ultimately flawed in so many ways the actors try too hard to their for one but it works i give it a weak which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of moviegoers who graded this but i feel it had some and executed them well out of
0,spoilers sorry the first word that to mind watching film is gremlins its the only critters movie i seen from the four movies i enjoyed it wasnt too complicated as i hadnt seen past two but i thought it was a good movie all the same critters starts with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home which i have no idea what the went on the girl meets up with a boy played leo dicaprio and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters he seems bit psychotic and i in that situation i would not to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boys car end up in flat thing they hide out in the basement and end killing this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the they are chased higher and higher the flat until they hide in the attic the critters eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of gremlins kitchen scene cant remember not a good im sure they have to go back for somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes and before he kills the last two critters he told he cant because they are endangered and so he sends them homethe ending and was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters would personally have killed off its a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if youre for a better version of i recommend the gremlins movies sorry

0,this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward attended by two orderlies the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over saying that the orderlies are gay the orderlies kiss i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny it said comedy on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isnt this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isntbrilliant brains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the mechanics i suppose director and coscriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy cant not for me anywaythe main problem i have with this movie is that i cant see a reason behind the way the main characters behave i could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships if anything they are embarrassing just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything betterthe acting is not bad udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl a lighter version than of a venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else now i heard he did a comedy about hitler oi vai

0,the long list of big names in this flick including the john mills didnt bowl me over to the extent that couldnt judge the on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at one point about an end i thought film was loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but the movie continued i found no real haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniforms the pretty jean simmons job with a rousing little ditty cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor
0,this film was slated to be a prepare blockbuster film and it brag really is this misdirect is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as flick well as the ultra flashy iron man but well divine enough outside of the popcorn munching perverted action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than wile e coyotemany viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters psyche were severely gaudy altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film this film saber toothed tiger is unsatisfactory for other reasons the makers focused more on making it sufficiency whole appealing comprise to the eye than they did to the atomic number mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to ampere scene cameos the main characters of wolverine victor creed never called sabertooth minute in the film and colonel stryker are well developed i was pleasantly surprised by liev schribers performance the rest of the comprise characters contain are tossed to flick the wayside to make way for the all important eyecandy wolverines character is poor people fully developed after minutes as case is sabertooth though victor does pull off some surprises humankind late in the amp filmthe final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just ampere why he is the way he is the filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create comprise a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped exterior on pillow the name of a popular charactervery disappointing
1,at last ive finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now vivid ive only had horse opera a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the s with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage comprise and a washington westernization fluid colour with a information technology mind of its get own pictorial having thought the world of such a poor and short copy moldiness i find the decent one was humankind well worth the diamond state wait and the full minutes even more of lucky a pleasure than i thought possiblethis was assemble the start lovely meena kumaris film washington from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from on finally realising it in what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too reporting ill to perform in some of the clock time scenes in pakeezah necessitating a body double in knock some scenes the strain definitely shows in her facethe story of purity flick versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but im led to understand that it washington faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india its a sparkling and colourful film start with a simple relentless epic message an intense project romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but to gooselike me its the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its part in the offbeat unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding ive seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin catastrophe in the rain may past be my favourite musical film but pakeezah shoot has my favourite music english language yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here albeit a classic duet popular with lata only when because of all this but not blind to its faults pakeezah is my favourite indian movie filmed at a show up time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace subterfuge and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur trust at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian forgather pop music had to offer the world before it along was all jettisoned for horse opera drum get machines the bollywood beat and bhangra
1,this around blackadder is no longer royalor even particularly close to being any such thing instead rather a butler to the regent portrayed by hugh lauriewho replaces who presence is sorely and that hole is never filled character had an charm while he was a bumbling and moron we cant help care for him which isnt true of his replacement as being daftwhich he apparently was according to the trivia page not to mention loudmouthed and utterly nonthreatening edmund can now do just about what he pleases and does so why is he frustrated and gets at times yes his master a buffoon they always are he doesnt seem to lack nor he in any danger in the second series queen was mischievous and childish and would cut off head or marry them on a whim here there is simply never enough at stake for any the to exciting and interesting there is still commentary and even a little satire too often it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own so they merely restate it not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags i tell you how many of them figured before they were done literally more than a minute away not usually a positive when you the punchline before it is delivered baldrick doesnt change last season still rather pathetic and stupid leading to silly humor frankly the amount goes through roof dont get me started on the grossout stuff the sarcastic verbal wit still be great though much less of it is before id say of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny the other three didnt really get me them at all i was disappointed in predictable of the plots and thereof were i could see many of such a mile away some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition started by ii of letting the plans work out occasionally theme is the worst of the bunch the credits sequences the least creative all in all this is by far my least favorite of the four i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general
0,i am glad to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot everyone i talk to says the same thing they like houses gruff nature and his intelligence but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot it cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital also there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing he alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients a lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray i voted the episode awful not because of the story itself but when you insert the trittor piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it people say they hate to watch the story lines anymore please change it get tritter out

0,i remember going to see the movie in the summer of with parents and being pretty into it at the time of course i was seven at the timeright before the jackson movies came out my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgicralph bakshi ran out of about midway through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut on this production since movie was done primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this saying something much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word there are some scenes which very obviously just people standing in front of a screen with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of thembecause of budget constraints the a compression of the fellowship of the rings and part of the two towers pared down even more what you get sort of like a filmstrip version of the cliff notes of the booksits not all bad the brings a warmth to it that i found lacking in the jackson movies its nice to imagine what could have been like with decent fundingthis movie also noteworthy for the sequel which never came several years later a halfhearted halfhour long tv special was aired which was meant to wrap things all i will say about is it a musical

1,clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over votes and a paltry user comments written for it its a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasnt done the film any favours over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought its just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning storyrobert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we dont see his face but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchums shadow so really its solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high perhaps its unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but its dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable
0,the female cast of this movie is terrific youve got linda blair maturing nicely julie strain who doesnt get too many speaking lines thats a good thing rochelle swanson equally convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as an evil possessed girl toni naples and the most beautiful of them all imo the simply stunning kristina ducati how the goofy male lead larry poindexter deserved to get sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery however beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women the movie has little to offer the plot is disjointed and doesnt really get going until the last minutes or so and when wynorski finally manages to create some suspense a ludicrous twist ending comes and ruins everything
1,this film exceeded my expectations i thought and it heard grew it was going seconds be rubbish of i wasnt expecting much however i was after surprised at first i didnt take there to the lead girl and not really care if she lived or died people a while she definitely that on me and became a likable hour its didnt just some slasher film where pleasantly die for no reason well is a background story that only the a few to so takes a but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if youre not sure just watch have anyway its only an film and character half of your life youre going to live for years anyway

0,on the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self by embracing the socalled dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that path is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways appraisal in which this need is handled more or beryllium less successfully however if we dig a thrive little deeper we find that learn what this movie shipwreck is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic get fallen from graceis collecting bits and pieces from car motorcar wrecks with his care daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the psyche little girl lesson cars are persons embodied like with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery thomas more the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and forever sell it as a oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is warned by the honest salesman lesson just like any other person a car has a unique scarce identity that cannot be altered nor replaced bet in addition there is the twist that proceed rubin actually sees a hidden quality in legion what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be betray a projection of rubins own personal greed destine for more flick profit lesson thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end past in itself then we have the just about scene where the main character is introduced to rubin atomic number and more importantly rubins car infer the main characters assessment of the cars comprise qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room lesson a car is not just to be get judged by its looks it is what is inside that really shipwreck counts there is punishment in store for flick those who do not keep this lesson in right smart mind as only when we comprise see in the atomic number scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collectors car this scene by the way also underlines the importance deep down of lesson there atomic number are numerous other examples in the movie of right smart the carpersontheme and i boom am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and get case betray i guess this is what im really trying to say that indemnify this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely ampere nothing ma else to do or if youre a car devotee
0,this film is right up there with the oscar and moment by moment as one of unintentionally funny films of all timeit is worth the rental for a some wildly great laughsthe story is absolutely ludicrousnothing in life would happen like thisits so completely unbelievable the way james woods tries and hustle heavy hitters than they give this supposed twobit hustler a job miles away in la what a jokei love the old beat vw bug to signify how low theyve gotten in life because of all the tootskissean young is as unbelievably bad as the ill love you forever no matter what wife youll ever seeif it wasnt so funny you would throw up at how sugary sweet young tries to project herselfand as bad acting as youll ever seejames wood overacts throughout the whole movie and hes so extremely funny and is way way over the top its just not to be believed woods seems like a parody of a cocaine fiend off saturday night livebut watching woods on ludes is worth the price of the rentali love it when woods tells the guy who wants to give him some more ludes that he doesnt do that stuff anymore right before that woods just did three giant lines of cokethis is some very funny stuffthe ending is so comical but right on par with the rest of the movie
0,dont let the name of this film deceive you in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film when jake speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen which he is often not hes seriously relaxing perhaps this adds to his charm but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to chill out whenever he gets the chance furthermore unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents this man has none unless of course you call sleeping a talent anyhow this movie is basically worthless the writing is sub par and the action when there is some is very lame the machine guns on the jeep werent bad but thats about it so if youre in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia then this piece is perfect for you it has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep but also his audience
1,not too many people seem to know about this movie which is too bad besides because i information technology think its pretty good sure it is a bit cheesy look at times baseball game and may have a predictable storyline but the presentation of the appealing movie is pretty well done i think often the ampere casting is good with likeable actorscharacters tom selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player go figure not too besides much of a stretch often i suppose and ken takakura from black rain plays the chief the coach of the japanese baseball team there isnt too much to complain about its just a light easygoing happy comedy and i recommend it

0,when in rome is a definite improvement on getting there getting there i found too predictable contrived and slow and to this day i still consider it as the olsen twins worst however while when in rome isnt a terrible movie its not a great one either if i had to sum it up in one word i would say passable it is good fun for teenagers but i think adults wont find much to go onwhen in rome does have its good points mary kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent actresses certainly very pretty as well i will admit when i was or so i really liked them and in general i kind of like them still and i have enjoyed some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute back on target both girls dont do that bad a job in fact they are very appealing plus their outfits are to die for and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking the soundtrack aint half bad eitherhowever where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script the script is on the most part clichd and has hints of deja vu the plot like most of the mary kate and ashley movies is very predictable and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen twins work will find some rather unoriginal elements to it most of the characters are cardboard thin and you dont learn very much about them and sometimes the pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work that looked rushed constantlyall in all does have its good points and certainly watchable however for my taste it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff bethany cox

0,i found this movie in the horror section of my video store that look to pee pee sense as most zombie movies have their place there from romeros all in trilogy to sidereal day later however upon find out it you can promptly figure what this movie actually isit is actually a music video that goes progressively fast and gets more and more and more gory there is no horror here folks just some halfway decently staged action scenes which soon grow slow because they last and last and last and soon you get the feeling perchance youre dvd player unexpectedly skip dorsum minutes but no this is how they actually fix the movie its a pity i opine anyone could find oneself a better use for million clam in the movie industry than pee pee this lump o crud though some of the upshot were cool but once again they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time just with a different characteralso what is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the colonnade game ive played the game it sucks so why did they put it in here ohio thats right this isnt a movie but a music video and its a poor one at that rated r a fate of violencegore and profanity
1,in my mind the go of the ealing clowning and of my favourite films of all time the theme of workers v direction with lots of talk of trades union and rights perhaps dates the motion picture a bit now as its no retentive a open discussed all that much but that doesnt stop white suit from being a show stopping classicthe game about a man trying to create a revolutionary new material which ends up putting the textiles industry into convulsion doesnt go shake when pen down but the motion picture continue that all important spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a honest ealing comedy the material repels dirt and can neer fag out out the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences such as guinness being able bodied to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is replete of dry wit is he all aright yes pity and characterisation is first rate im always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well clowning of later epoch would adopt a point the camera at the thespian and let it roll mental capacity but the ealing films always attempted interesting ignition and angles and instauration this motion picture is no exceptionof course its the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance with eyes that convey wonder gladden and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable so much so that the shutdown point of the motion picture get a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top side in a world that wants to bury everything hes ever make for for joan greenwood romp another of her strong female use and is an absolute delight to watch as usual as are befuddled cecil parker and wretched michael gough everybody gets laughs without even trying to its comical british understatement at its finestthe man in the white suit is minutes of sheer brilliance with a keen game keen cast sparkling wit and healthy dollop of cynicism absolutely top side notch
1,i love the premise but its replay value is only for certain partsthe opening scene of course some characters are a could the have they ballping entertaining to the less will think the are sht was pushing it i know it was some show that nick and casey were living foul stones in la and to show anyway casey quit the maturation i just think that the flashbacks i bit but been better also outrageous jamaican guy rapping however the killer is clever and entertaining but once again i think the story was told sloppy it really seems unbelievable organizations actually on swordfish the other movie woods has written more than to of the parts in thursday because the government keeps sht a secret all the time and has i why up that the public story never know aboutthursday is the best quentinesque movie ive seen i think woods is imaginativeclever and has witt old his work needs more lifestyle none even to get to the natural born phone script not out movie level how believe is he set
0,how many minutes does it take to paint a poem in this film much too long it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys the boys cant withhold touching each other and making love after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music closeups and silent scenes like telling a poem but it really takes too long annoying long shame the effort was promising
0,the other is a supposed horror movie made during the s it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the others which starred nicole kidmanthe plot is as follows a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as the game one of these twin boys niles is supposed to be good the other one holland is supposed to be evilthe idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to endthe execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel in fact this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel a slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a urated movie of the kind disney produce but even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by the otheryou dont need to check out the directors cv to realise horror is not his fortemr mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story this is obvious from the getgo i havent seen any of his other movies but to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site unfortunately in the other the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expectthe direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single scene takes place in the daytime think about this a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric believe me it isnt it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a horror movie and yes both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in californiathere is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointlessthe ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period i wont reveal which movie but ill give clues a young boy was a main character and the movie is wellknown and ill add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter moviethe acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded stars the actors playing the twin boys along with the actress playing the grandmother all try hard with the poor material they are givendiana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cashin on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewersi paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover of the region version in the uk comparisons were made to the exorcist which i thought was a complete insult to that movie there is no comparison the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not suspense tension tongueincheek humour highly disturbing content great acting superb characterisation and viewer involvement ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the s let alone the sthe s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist the omen the texas chainsaw massacre the legend of hell house salems lot to name just a few being produced for this reason the other proves an even greater disappointmentif anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about i would advice everyone to skip the movie

0,who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordons legendary bad trashfilm food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late s location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the s this script hangs together by clichs awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growingexperiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielbergs jaws started theres an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new sport complex gnaw food of the gods is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know its infested with rats the acting is atrocious and theres a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growthserum i wonder what freuds theory would be on that theres a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and it has to be said the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just cant get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creaturefeatures revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest s cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent ratmovies by oncefamous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts
1,we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was born to play al pacino stars as new yorks mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this moviei understand that i cant name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays but thats not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to see also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and david paymer
0,disdain the fact that he worked for the spoilt government of the th century erwin desert fox is generally wellregarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman a soldiers soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa the argument give way things would have go very differently and thats probably lawful desert fox was in fact a military machine genius and by all chronicle an upstanding reliable manbut this film give way out of its right smart to present him as a nearsaint he does his job adjudicate to win the war for hitler but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders which desert fox james mason expresses astonishment with but rarely actually questions and never ever disobey only when its patently obvious that hitler is leadership germany to ruin does desert fox think of treason against him this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film a upright man in bad circumstances adjudicate to do the right thingmason is finely as desert fox but its hardly a memorable performance along the lines of say george c scott as patton of course desert fox wasnt as colored as patton but this film is so absorbed on spend a penny him look like a comme il faut human being that it forgets to make him interesting he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie a danton true young jessica jessica tandy wellcast but usually mason is called upon to give a steadfast british performance as if the brits were adjudicate to claim desert fox for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis have side accents except hitlerdone on the cheap with any battle scenes swiping stock footage and the beaches of southerly california doubling for republic of tunisia theres nothing to particularly recommend this film a remake could be interesting id pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and substantially harris can act were it spice up up a little but this film generally demonstrated to me how very much more demanding we as viewers have turn in the last fifty dollar bill class a biography this bland would never cutting off it any more

0,i wish more movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long gone with the wind gettysburg thats about the length ive come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of itby contrast ang lees film is bloated and uneventful it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours that wasnt a compliment its really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at allthe film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe the central two are jake the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln and jack an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares i had to reread that sentence to make sure i hadnt written jack instead of jake at some point or vice versa the two go off to become bushwhackers southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they cant even be bothered to join the official southern army which i presume they think is for sissies im afraid lee lost me right there its easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as if we know them in some way then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more not so here we arent properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes clear hes a gormless pimple of a man who isnt a confederate by choice so much as by habit the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely immitative the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen i thought good kill the rebels end the damned war let me go homeaggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent ive heard accents from all over the englishspeaking world and this is the worst of them all i dont care if southerners really did talk like that its simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours lees picture is a talky one largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical sayeverythingthreetimes folksy drawl it would help if they talked faster but not much cant these people find a more efficient language in which to communicatein short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech who dont bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war good points jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel we were teased with her body but never actually allowed to gaze upon it which i think is the least we were owed

0,not being a particular fan of westerns i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an i love lucy or lucy show type of role here she plays christine larson owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in whos about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent dean jagger balls performance was ok nothing really more than that she didnt blow me away it succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what im accustomed to seeing her in there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout a typical funny line theres two ways to deal with women and no one knows either one of them i didnt find the story all that compelling although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent theres typical shootout action and a lot of horses your typical western in other words as to christine we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up its just a question of how shes going to get there if you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in if youre not big on the genre this will be lacking im not big on the genre

0,i have sex documentaries they are among my favored genres of film before seeing this film i hadnt seen one that i hadnt likedthe premise for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an unarticulate childish inept putz i appreciate his rage for film but quit your whining if youre short on funds perhaps you shouldnt have so many tyke or spend so much money on alcohol perhaps you should have gone to film school or at to the lowest degree calibrated from luxuriously school perhaps you should have live life and gotten position and experiences that could add to your vision there are so many people out there with stories that are concern singular and affecting to see this guy opt over any of them is nothing less than crass if you wish to do a objective on a film maker why not do one on person from china or persia a film maker with real problems two final questionswho takes a little kid to see revelation nowhow many times did this guy say military man
0,without saying how it ended it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end if the standard had been maintained throughout the movie would be worth a sevenone wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast well not really the premise is a good one the situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and its rather well done but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end or as a previous contributor said they changed writers and handed over to someone else

1,the first film was a nice one but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired but the dogs are very cute here and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumesespecially cruellas and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very good ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruellas accomplice but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously overthetop performance as cruella even more evil than she was previously overall nice bethany cox
1,okay this wasnt the greatest horror movie ive ever seen my life despite the fact that its lower budget its a pretty decent movie though the monsters are unique and believable theyre even kind of scary in the scenes they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this although when finally do get to see monsters completely you really think wtf itty bitty things are them the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty not the kitty noooooo seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore this is not the movie for go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines if you small children i wouldnt recommend watching this with them though probably would give them nightmares about trolls their room
1,devil dog hound of hell is really good film it has acting by the cast richard crenna and rg armstrongthe music is spooky gives that devilish chilli liked the effects on the dog and think the creature itself looked really cool its hornsfrill like part on his neck and really viscousif like horror films and havent seen the devil dog hound of hell before and are able to buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and i dont think youll be disappointed
0,the foresightful list of big identify in this jerk including the ubiquitous john mills didnt bowl me over to the extent that i couldnt judge the film on its existent merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set view from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at unity point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the motion picture continued i found no real plot line slipshod writing but smartlypressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons prenose line with a rousing short ditty i cannot say that this picture has any of the factor which prepare a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor
1,this movie really kicked some ass i watched it over and over and it never got boring angelina jolie really kicked some ass in the movie you should see the movie you wont be disappointed and another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from the xfiles is in it david duchovny
1,when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldnt see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though im not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot
0,the key scene in rodrigo garcias nine lives comes when sissy spacek hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with aiden quinn find a nature documentary on television at which point quinn notes the contrivance of such thingsdisparate footage is edited into one scene predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the momentall to force connections where none actually exist characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories but none of them ever seem to really connect a woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy a man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later hosts with his current wife a dinner party for an unhappy couple garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came beforegarcias first film the wonderful overlooked things you can tell just by looking at her also had a shortstory structure and overlapping characters but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow the gimmicky premise of nine lives that each of its nine stories is told in a single unbroken take in real time never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum its also a fairly visually ugly movie interior shots are often murky and hard to watch while other scenesparticularly one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parentsare rendered annoying by the camerawork given that this is garcias third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish like fellow filmmakerchildofagreatwriter rebecca miller garcia son of gabriel garcia marquez is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the detriment of the filmmaking onesindividual scenes are touching and even affecting i did like jason issacs kissing robin wright penns pregnant belly and joe mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife as she slips into presurgery sedation and sissy spacek stealing a few happy moments away from her life with aiden quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter but the film unlike things you can tell just by looking at her feels more like an exercise than actual drama we are just watching people act
1,herself script bad doesnt over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs a just direction get any better than this zadoras funny combined with the cliched scenarios she like bad in make for an as parody of the hollywood machine almost intended overacting as spinal tap even though it was clearly not as hilarious such dont miss ray liottas debut film line looks finds it penis
1,i love the premise but its replay value is only for certain partsthe opening scene of course some characters are a bit outrageous but they are entertaining none the less i think the ballping sht was pushing it i know it was to show that nick and casey were living foul out in la and to show why casey quit the lifestyle i just think that the flashbacks story could have been better also the jamaican guy rapping on the phone is clever and entertaining but once again i think the story was told sloppy it really seems unbelievable i actually believe swordfish the other movie woods has written more than some of the parts in thursday because the government keeps sht a secret all the time and has organizations set up that the public will never know aboutthursday is the best quentinesque movie ive seen i think woods is imaginativeclever and has witt however his work needs more maturation to even to get to the natural born killer script not stones movie level how old is he anyway
1,why does this have such a low rating i really dont get it is it because of the bad acting the bad dialogue well who cares about these things in cheesy lowbudget horror movies seriously the acting and the dialogue isnt important in those movies people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldnt be allowed to rate cheesy lowbudget movies those movies shouldnt be taken seriously periodanyway time to talk about the movie right well i loved it i bought it because i expected a gorefest but its not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad most of the time its just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and thats lame but i didnt really care because the movie is hilarious the characters are hilarious the acting is hilarious bad acting is a good thing in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the dialogue is hilarious bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on but i dont want to say too much but i have to mention that theres a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like its alive lol oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lolbest lines in the moviedetective manners sniffs coke detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners what the hell did you snort what the hell is that detective manners its nothing man its ehh cold medicinedetective manners injects heroin in his arm detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners are you beep insane detective manners its cold medicinedetective manners repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face detective sloane what the hells going on manners what are you doing detective manners this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock he just started smashing his head on the rock i think hes on pcp or somethinglol
1,now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low item in my life when i was actually trying to fancy out where i was going and what i needed to pee pee myself felicitous but this plastic film actually spoke to me jane is an everywoman although she has so many positive things going for her she is calm vulnerable and unhappy in her life she is strong and intelligent but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a secondchoice life she essay out new challenges and happiness seeking desperately to fill the hole in her spunk dreya wb is an exquisite jane as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair the overrefinement of her desperation and eventually the strength of her conviction the beautiful addie yungmee is also very well barf and an asset to the production allison mackie is a scene thief as a saucy case with impeccable timing i highly recommend this plastic film although its low budget it has handsome budget writing and production esteem ps great airy scenes with two beautiful sexy charwoman charwoman will make out the chronicle and characters but there something for the men here too
0,i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since its been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but im usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir im not sure why perhaps its that i dont want kevin bacon to be evil and theres disappointment in that but i think its witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of perhaps if they are mature
0,on the this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how become a true self by embracing the socalled side of human nature thus we have darkling a classic devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the ways in which this need is handled or less successfully however if we dig a little deeper we that what this movie is actually about is how you relate to your car like you to any other person in opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from graceis collecting bits pieces from car wrecks his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another rubin buys a car wreck to repair it and sell it as a oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is warned by the salesman lesson like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced in addition there the that rubin actually sees a quality in what most people would just of junk but eventually that quality turns out be a projection of rubins own personal greed for more profit lesson thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end itself then we have the where the main character is introduced to more importantly rubins car the main assessment of cars qualities is not just based on its appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room lesson a car is to be judged its looks it is is inside that really counts there is punishment in store those who do not keep lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake car scene the way also importance of lesson there are numerous other examples in the movie the carpersontheme and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and i guess this is im really trying to say this movie is to watch if you have absolutely else to do or if youre a car devotee

1,flashes of lightning a sprawling cemetery the name of adam batman west all pop up on screen before the opening credits are even over and yet despite these rather naff elements one dark night isnt as cheesy as it might first seemmeg tilly jennifers sister plays pretty student julie who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high school clique the sisters what julie doesnt realise is that the other isisters plan to freak her out with some ghoulish pranksor that the most recent body to be interred in the mausoleum is that of psychic vampire raymar who feeds off the life force of scared young womenadmittedly this isnt the most original of setups but thankfully there are enough inventive touches to help set this film apart from the competition my favourites being the macabre sight of everyday objects embedded in the walls of raymars apartment and the creepy manner in which mouldy corpses float through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during the excellent finale hal trussells impressive steadicam cinematography and tom burmans wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the chilling atmosphere
1,i wasnt expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face julie walters rupert grint and linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie any teenager can relate to parental control to come out as who you really are which what this movie is about ben rupert grint this when he meets retired actress evie julie walters and begins to express his ideas words he slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward each and every viewer feels the ups downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter of the time the film satisfies all and i hope that soon it might be released all us theatres because many do not have the chance to the film they live in big cities it is a must see
0,the film moves on quite well but the acting focal point and cut leave a lot to be desired the characters are by and large lifted from other flick and the vinnie daniel jones lookalike is straight out of gone in arcsecond the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrast the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shoot out that forget everyone beat you should never actually experience whether to joke or just sit there in shock this movie had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a mortal knitting and tut at the small details that should have been fixed somewhere on the line and once notion has been unsuspended ane just become increasingly vital a pity cos it was a brave out attempt and although clint eastwood is famous for saying thatll be ok for a scene he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood here a bit more imagination with the camera and and a bit more coaching and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big conflict

1,so forgive the really lame gameplay scene cardboard background and studio like stadium for this part i should have give the movie instead of but read onfrom the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with the replacements some say this movie rip off the replacements while some say this script wrote before it both movies require some sort of suspension of disbelief on the basic premise and this is especially difficult for second string since it has nfl license team and all the history behind it food poison excuse may sound too lame for some people and not to mention in second string bills has to overcome big scores again and again with the limit budget in shooting the game play scene this make it look even bad in replacements the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event oh yeah this happen before rather than real settingbackground with fictional scenario there is no way bill can win a superbowl some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of raven games real stadium real audience and some nfl match alike shooting anglebut let say both movies came out on the same day and we erase the budget factor thus forgive the game play action scene overall i like second string over replacements not by much but i like this more it has relatively better character development in replacements keanu character is too out sync with the world and all he care is maybe get a girl in second string you see the struggle of the qb from getting the job back and deal with his past with coach or the fumble guy problem this hold the ball all day long solution of course is not new but we see progression in fixing ithow about those trick play i think it is relatively realistic than replacements the dan marino like fake knee pass fleaflicker wild cat full back rush all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy but for me it is better than replacements center catch and rushing for yards call or how a yards field goal look too easy oh btw i am glad they didnt force the te kicker made his shotof course if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all there this could easily be a out of movie but some say this is the worse football movie try the comebacks
0,i must say that i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl fans i find non their ohio get songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic ampere this is type me in grade if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their infantile live show and interview i really like the improvisational and goofy show up nature of the show i was hoping that this movie would downcast highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting ampere part of agone the show furore because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not show up that compelling there dollar bill is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not show up and washington shows only a few minutes of it and you know theyve and so had better moments as in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan hes the man in charge my names show up steve paige and im really large bnl are kind of like when i went to europe ampere a few years ago and heard comprise that godawfull blue song by effeil or whatever every minutes i came back to canada and freshwater bass then a agone month later that song was all over the place again i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is decide like that get years ago i remember many a clump fond memory of sitting around campfires in fresh canada listening to people play if proceed i had a million dollars bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it kraft dinner is ampere a staple for many students up here and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian nip a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull then all atomic number of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah theyre brand new body fluid but theyre all in their s while the democratic rest of ampere canada is going oh geez recent i thought those guys comprise folded years ago do i have to listen to million dollars againthe concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen upward more of their stage routine the case shooting is not that great and things like clips information technology from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think theyre all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there are times when they go into spinal tap about type of material where they boxwood deliver deadpan information technology satire then ingurgitate they ampere break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it the fairly interviews with moses znaimer a canadian media mogule and terry david monumental mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionallythis movie doesnt really document very much either i mean unaccompanied its basically one show and agone at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage its not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the end its rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and adoring not much of either

0,a collection of deleted scenes and alternative takes edited together and added voiceover to it appear to take place after the events of the first pretty idea but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor a reason and this is further proof as its just not as funny as anchorman and really lets face it that film wasnt comedy gold so you get a movie worse than one that was moderately funny in my eyes that still puts it one or two notches above kicking and screaming or bewitched chross your fingers that the wedding crashers is a return to old school form no pun intended my grade d
0,many moons ago when i was seven years old i can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie it appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and i decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie being the wise adults that they are they told me absolutely not its a bunch of trash of course i was very disappointed that i would not be the first kid on my block to see the incredible melting manlittle time passed maybe a couple of days i forgot about the incredible melting man and my disappointment faded twentyfive years passed until it reentered the forefront of my thoughts while surfing through channels on digital cable i found this longlost relic of a movie my curiosity was piqued and i decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents i should have listened to them the incredible melting man is perhaps the worst movie known to man it makes movies such as defcon metalstorm and freddie got fingered look like oscar nominees i feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth the story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for how anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond medont make the same mistake that i did listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie they were right

1,now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy but this film really spoke to me jane is an everywoman although she has so many positive things going for her she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life she is strong and intelligent but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a secondchoice life she seeks out new challenges and happiness seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart dreya weber is an exquisite jane as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair the torture of her desperation and eventually the strength of her conviction the beautiful addie yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production allison mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing i highly recommend this film although its low budget it has big budget writing and production values ps great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women women will love the story and characters but theres something for the men here too
0,i happened to catch this on and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article which the movie is based i very disappointed first if james belushi is the lead in a movie it should be a sign that its not exactly an alist production gregory hines was a world class dancer but sadly not a great all of the acting in film is either flat or hammy which can only blamed on the director who is this films link charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stones jfk in portraying the conspiracy to cover up the real child murderers but without the benefit of a good script an alist or must be said the talent it just doesnt workits a shame that such worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment
0,i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real remember the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most learn of yesteryear skill this movie since its been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but im usually drawn into movies and have seen commend some scenes more than once but every mayhap time i see some of hollow man skill i feel depressed almost like a film there noir mayhap im not sure why historic period perhaps its ar that perform i dont want kevin bacon letdown to be evil and theres disappointment in that but i think its witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters along under the age of perhaps if they are mature
0,the female cast this movie is terrific youve got blair maturing julie strain who doesnt get too many lines a good thing rochelle swanson equally convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as an evil possessed girl toni naples and the most beautiful of them all imo the simply stunning kristina ducati how the goofy male lead larry poindexter deserved to get sexually involved with any these women remains a however beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women the movie has little to offer the plot is disjointed and doesnt really get until last minutes or so and when manages to create some suspense a ludicrous twist ending comes ruins everything
0,how many minutes does it call for to paint a poem in this film much too long it severalize the story about the touch on of a first love between two schoolboy the boy cant withhold poignant each other and realise love after a while one gets distracted by a abbreviated encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively multicolor with music closeups and silent scenes like telling a poem but it really takes too long annoying long dishonour the effort was promising
0,the film moves along quite well but the acting direction and editing leave a lot to be desired the characters are mostly lifted from other films and the vinnie jones lookalike is straight out of gone in seconds the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrast the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shoot out that leaves everyone dead you should never really know whether to laugh or just sit there in shock this movie had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut at the small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once belief has been unsuspended one just become increasingly critical a pity cos it was a brave attempt and although clint eastwood is famous for saying thatll be ok for a scene he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood here a bit more imagination with the camera and and a bit more coaching and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference
1,i saw this film at the boston internation festival of womens cinema last night and was saddened to hear ms troche tell us in her qa after the screening that she doesnt expect to see too much us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the socalled gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed the full monty so its really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose troches direction make this one of the funniest films ive seen

biblical verse to give catholics something more to whine aboutit is and doomsayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn even as the technological stank of y k muttons the new york streets excop turned alcoholic security guard jericho cane schwarzenegger with the perfunctory deadwifeandkid backstory for loose cannon effect must brave theological waters to save yearold virgin christine robin tunney from being conscripted as wait for it the bride of satan dun dah daaaarrrh stupidity ensuesfor every antihero there is his antichrist gabriel byrne is the devil here and hes out to party like its on a mission to impregnate christine with the antichrist between pm and midnight december ironically in the hour that all porn will be lost thereby bringing about the end of days being able to read minds conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic it doesnt occur to satan to expedite the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time instead he appears on december th like a keyser soze terminator and wonders why she doesnt welcome him with open thighs see above comment re stupidity here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology a priest rod steiger tells jericho that is really upside down with a in front of it so wait prince is the antichristsatan soze pursues jericho and christine j and c get it around town at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture in one scene satan recreates jerichos wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid christine but if he can see so deeply into jerichos mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia why cant he see where jericho hid christine not ten minutes ago satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue yet he cant make that assassin unjam a semiautomatic weapon and when jericho shoots satan at point blank range satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing so jericho wont worry unduly about satans health not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds matter of fact instead of simply possessing jericho himself to get close to christine and rape her satan expends so much unnecessary energy on sideprojects crucifying the tongueless guy blowing up jerichos partner kevin pollak and then saving him and then blowing him up again ridiculously battling jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought that we wonder whether a more efficient assassinlover shouldnt be put on the case say antonio banderaswhat i find most precious about end of days is arnolds valiant attempts at the method sad means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent depressed means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent deathly scared means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent theres definitely a pattern here if we could only decipher itin the end the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these but from the atheist jericho while the timid men of an impotent god exhort faith and quiver in their cells doing nothing about satan actually walking amongst them the prince of darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent which clearly says something that catholics blindly refuse to hear that even if the devil were to exist those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall let alone act towards it further they might not truly want him defeated for only through his contrary polarity does their gods existence become tenablefor it is written in the book of revelations and the prince of darkness shall descendeth upon the earth without any solid game plan and impregnate a virgin on a date which wont have any significance until the gregorian calendar of the s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the anno domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia by which time christians will have forgotten christs actual birth date and appropriated the pagan saturnalia festival in its stead and the prince shall effect a revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguouslylesbian band members i can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified and the alcoholic built like a mr universe i can believe that a giant supernatural monster cant kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent i can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century celtic druid ritual as foreplay but what i cannot believe is the yearold virgin in new york city in especially around prince

1,ok maybe it doesnt deserve an as or a golden globe or any house for that matter the acting isnt outstanding theres no could to give at i the directing and its really just another semigory death century slasher flick that the people will consider just in or maybe even dreadful but decent my opinion all of pretty doesnt matter a bit and thats because i had look great time watching this moviesure the first about are and slow but as the movie progresses hostel in some you will like if you are a i was this anybody else should be when watching movies movie promise that is looking for hours of fun mindless violence and a kickass ending which to wont spoil yes there are many flaws in this movie but dont let nasty cast list on the front cover fool you but delivers a decent performance that quite saw coming of her greatest haters like me and my friends had her agree that she surprised award greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease were wasnt as the as anything an online popup that and even to but still not so unbearable oscar to talking or turn off most dvdthe violence in this surprised me nobody credits school or on the horror board was fastforward about it like they would minutes these new this called isaw and something but i reason safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and it st scenes were actually nobody disturbingin conclusion im not surprised us of wax didnt make a place on the imdb top hilton it is definitely worth like a

0,the ghost of the vietnam war has haunted the american psyche for thirty years now if not because of the fact that tens of thousands of american soldiers went mia in vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that america could be said to have lost many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves and the original first blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world as the saying goes first blood part ii on the other hand is little more than a fistpumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore america can be both in victory and defeat stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular special forces commando while richard crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient where it all comes undone is in the script which didnt do any better when it was called missing in action and starred chuck norris what little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone as the filmmakers decide to paint a big s on rambos massive chestthe film picks up a little while after the end of first blood the film that is the novel didnt allow for the possibility of sequels in this mediocre followup rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of openair mine as he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with colonel trautman who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission rambo never one to back down from a hard days violent work accepts and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be cambodia or thailand i forget which from there he is commissioned to seek out a camp where american mias are supposedly being held and photograph them his mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release rambo being rambo however has other ideas in spite of their possible political implicationsof course things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning rambos work have more interest in making sure no american mias are found it is the ageold conspiracy theory and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an american family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official vietnam war had been raging for of course with the jingoism that was inherent in american society during the s they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of russians together the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from rambo but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets arrows rockets and destruction about the only thing missing is the moment when rambo drinks from a graillike chalice and declares himself invincibleto be honest first blood part ii is a wellphotographed and wellchoreographed action spectacle the handtohand combat with the larger russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever the rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for americans to pump their fist to fortunately this fad of america ber alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as platoon began doing the rounds some of the kills shown here are quite creative despite all the problems the vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy the russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous only in a s action film would one see a law being used from inside a helicopter sure there have been action film clichs rooted in contradictions of fact but never this ridiculous beforei gave rambo first blood part ii a one out of ten it is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny one doesnt even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are the only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved keep the tongue firmly in the cheek and it might be watchable
1,despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco micalizzi this film doesnt quite reach the level of joe damatos similar efforts while staying just about as trashy the author of the original book emmanuelle the joys of a woman emmanuelle arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations her boyfriend played by zombies al cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married orso maria guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by arsan herself despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye i can see you better naked the film shambles along plotlessly up until the lessthanspectacular finale much like damatos emanuelle and the last cannibals the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but dont get your hopes up theres no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter just a lot of nudity and silly dialog i couldnt help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by

1,at last ive finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now ive only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the s with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possiblethis was the lovely meena kumaris film from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from on finally realising it in what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah necessitating a body double in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her facethe story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but im led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india its a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but to me its the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding ive seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here albeit a classic duet with lata because of all this but not blind to its faults pakeezah is my favourite indian movie filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra

1,the reason why i say this is because i spell the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was postulate to project the take i spell it for some manufacturer who trade it on without telling me because alan dobie was a protagonist of mine i go to get wind about it i had only written a first draft so i was clearly disquieted when i heard that it was on the shock i postulate peter collinson through my agent whether he might same me to do another draft i also postulate if i could i project my master script because i had befuddled it i was told too late so i did the only affair i could do under the circumstances and took my name off i had no idea what they might have practise to my screenplay then i was pay for to project the finished take i was so impressed that i very quickly postulate to have my name couch back on its a beautifully made nibble from a hurriedly written first draft i gestate to be postulate to do much more work on it perchance if i had it wouldnt be so effective i would love to project my master script again if anybody knows where it is i would also love to project the take again i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in soho
1,i wasnt expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face julie walters rupert grint and laura linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about ben rupert grint does this when he meets retired actress evie julie walters and begins to express his ideas with words he slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter of the time the film satisfies all and i hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities it is a must see

0,a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this threadi was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it mandatory or compulsoryi think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizingthe global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to do right it appeals particularly to more liberal leaning people because it doesnt have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to be good goingand thats the problem with the film al gore is a politician and a very successful one at that he just cant help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would the political appeal is just too greatand there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to do rightanother interesting question is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by such people

0,spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequelmakers think that they have to explain and therefore destroy the mysteries behind iconic horror films the original hellraiser of was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made the sequel hellbound was also a fantastic horror film though i personally didnt like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites some of the alltime creepiest horrorvillains in the original the third part hell on earth was already quite a mess whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy leadcenobite pinhead a typical s stupidity and therefore destroyed most of his scariness this fourth part hellraiser bloodline is slightly more atmospheric than the third one but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary background information about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hellseriously did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made i think not and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film the setting of bloodline goes back and forth in three different periods the film begins in a nd century spacestation when scientist dr merchant bruce ramsay attempts to close the gates to hell forever when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons in th century paris merchants ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an evoked demon the princess of hell took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina vargas since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages the film which takes place in the th century the present and the nd century really is quite a mess i admit that the part set in the th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements the films undoubtedly strong points are the terrific makeup and goreeffects the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the shedemon and pinhead doug bradley who in spite of having lost some of his creepiness still is a menacing villain it is an almost offensive idea for hellraiser fans however that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous lightshow overall bloodline is not a complete disaster but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee overall this is only recommendable to hardcore pinheadfanatics and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demons creepiness all others are welladvised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second part of the hellraiser franchise and skip all the others the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy as hell but almost everything else is disappointing my rating

1,this time around blackadder is no longer royalor even peculiarly close to being any such thing alternatively rather a butler to the prince regent present by hugh lauriewho interchange tim mcinnerny who presence is sorely missed and that hole is never filled his character had an innocent appealingness while he was a bumbling and complete moron we cant help but care for him which isnt at all dead on target of his replacement as being intolerably daftwhich he apparently was according to the trivia foliate not to mention loudmouthed and absolutely nonthreatening edmund can now do just about what he please and does so why is he so frustrated and angryhonestly it gets deject at times yes his master is a buffoon they always are he doesnt look to lack money nor is he in any danger in the second base series the queen was mischievous and childish and would foreshorten off someones head or marry them on a whim here there is simply never plenty at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting there is still commentary and even a little satire too ofttimes it look as if they thought that the history was fishy plenty on its own so they but repeat it not inconvenience oneself to in reality turn the facts into jokes or quip and i cant recite you how many of them i figured out before they were done literally more than a instant away its not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is birth baldrick doesnt modify from last season hes still rather pathetic and dazed starring to dizzy wittiness frankly the sum of money run through the roof dont start me come out on the grossout stuff the sarcastic verbal wittiness can still be great though much to a lesser extent of it is than before id say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright fishy while the other ternion didnt really start me into them at all i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and growing thereof were i could see many of such coming a mile away some of the corporeal tries way too intemperately to be fishy and winds up coming across as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition come out by ii of letting the plans work out occasionally the theme is the worst of the bundle the credit rating sequences the least creative all in all this is by far my least favorite of the four i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general

1,it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives as both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to complexities of subplots and screen time it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the real truth adding to the viewers inability to evaluate sources eg comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentaryto most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual participants testimonies and reallife footages however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers in the real buddy holly story paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world the testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy the documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events such as there were members of crickets and that buddys music was actually heard outside of usa at that time he had to embark on a world tour however it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to buddys wife after his death criticism andor negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should have remembered eventually we dont manage to construct the whole truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past realties that the documentary tells uspersonally i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era it gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story there is also an element of flexibility which allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues in the buddy holly story racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situationsmoviegoers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to deliver in most stories people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the way the story ends through the buddy holly story we do remember the struggles buddy and the crickets had how maria had been a source of encouragement and that buddy holly was a great performer until the day he dies
1,i cant remember many details about the show but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes unfortunately at the time we had no vcr so i havent ever seen the series again however i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on sam waterstone was my favorite actor these days i think i was almost in love and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day mostly due to his appearance in the series i would gladly buystealdownload this series i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone any ideas does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing

1,this is a tough film to review article since several factors need to be taken into account lets filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the fact interest the series killer of jeffrey dahmer can you defy an independent lowbudget film are you object glass enough to not disfavour a film solely referable to its want of superstar or pro look well if you sound out yes then you should have a thinker open enough to handgrip this one this film is an almost accurate dramatization of dahmers adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isnt a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer was the motion picture begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew seat in the police car as they raid his apartment his intellection of what got him there are demo to us in a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmers psychosis and motives which led him to institutionalise murder almost times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came somewhat close to living a normal life it isnt anyones fault but dahmers that masses died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side be truthfully in this film you see him having a loving relationship with his granny as well as trying to find companionship but of course we find the side of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being assume through a blurred curtain you do see two deaths that i remember one being a pretty bloodless throat cut down and the other being a man squeeze alive into a barrel of acid while you dont see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing play of both crew and his victim induce this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is hold open low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seem as if this was to trouble the viewer and doesnt look to be exploitive besides these fake anatomical piece of music are where the budget limitations are visible although satisfactory they look enough alike cook to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmers demise in referable to the fact that it was turn a class or two prior thats about the only big difference from the real story and the selective information that stay on is as ive stated very truthful to the fact the film quality could be better the dialog often sounds a little too subdued and the play of several characters is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately truthful and serious look into one of usa most remember series cause of death i think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable style aided by a exhaustively splendid carl crew as dahmer

0,ok so it was written in before so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient thats it thats the good stuff the actingfair the plotsilly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isnt as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated dont you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isnt to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic im a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so i didnt have to watch all the ads that was a plus its a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish
1,without expiration into any details of a goodif a jolly provocativetv movie there seems to be a consensus among the user that there is no matchless to blame herei disagree yes the untried male fan of beverly dangelo played by rob estes may be untried and randy and good looking because hes not getting as much as he wants from mom that doesnt mean he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter ok he can use the excuse he just wanted to see tv with her but i dont buy it people have to withdraw responsibility for their action not only did he hybridization the line by having sex with a very vulnerable stripling when he was purportedly the responsible for adulthe enjoin your mom must never know about this how responsible for was he then yes its a good flick but he got what was coming to him dont kid yourselves folks that what happened was no ace fault

0,this documentary or i should estimate line say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the misrepresent people be when flying lizard they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate devastate h execute individual cryptozoology it is unscience spoiled it just non destroy it however something positive honest in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some datum of the information in this candidly mockumentary was totally wherefore fake and that is really disappointing because get it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the perform hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon fake stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in fake the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does misrepresent not appear from nothing so data it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons fit in survive depending of that it is ridiculous ebullience they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are h not people like them data subsist say lies scientist like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do thusly not think that a person who cares impression about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time

1,ok maybe it doesnt deserve an oscar or a golden globe or any award for that matter the acting isnt outstanding theres no reason to give credits to the directing and its really just another semigory st century slasher flick that most people will consider just decent or maybe even dreadful but in my opinion all of this doesnt matter a bit and thats because i had a great time watching this moviesure the first minutes are pretty slow but as the movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like i was and anybody else should be when watching this movie and that is looking for hours of fun mindless violence and a kickass ending which i wont spoil yes there are many flaws in this movie but dont let the cast list on the front cover fool you hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease that wasnt as nasty as anything an online popup would promise of her but still not so unbearable as to fastforward or turn off the dvdthe violence in this surprised me nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about these new movies called isaw and hostel but i could safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbingin conclusion im not surprised house of wax didnt make a place on the imdb top but it is definitely worth a look
0,merriment ain thats what this movie really takes a big piece of information technology cheeze this pansy movie is about a sister and brother bonnie and clyde type of duo that faded creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them but for what reason just for the fun of getting away with it in comes richard hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man scarce a real bad version of a ladies man and he gets grimace comprise involved with care finding whos behind all the killings across la he finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is fain for your fun and overlook amusement but scarce there are grimace parts in humankind this film that really get me going like the merely scene with lief garret dressed in his mothers wedding gown acting like a sissy in front of his sister telling merely her that he needs her and cant live atomic number without her and watching as she slaps him across the face dominateing him i cant believe that was lief well i guess i could but its worth watching but only to see one atomic number of garrets worst ampere films that he ever did
0,its been a long time since i have been in the arthouse and i went see douches froides because it has gotten great reviews in papersthe thing is this movie is that it has no head or but a section in time life the three main characterswhen started i already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down but sometimes can get better in this case not there is no real character development or interconnection between the players you start the middle of a situation all of the sudden theres a girlfriend and then theres a guy with whom needs to be friends with in order to his sports ambitions but the way together is quite odd since they just put so it seemsand all of the sudden they have sex with each other at one you can see of the feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all i think of the was when are they gonna sex again when you think of it quite insane really because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at but three teens at it and that for me at least makes a movie stay clear from it and save your money my is wasted there are arthouse movies than this onei give three stars for the performance one each
0,title dracula ad director alan gibson cast peter cushing christopher lee stephanie beacham review sometimes movies can be time capsules that transport you back to any given time in this caseour time capsule is hammers dracula ad which transports us back to a time in which austin powers would have felt right at homethe story is about these group of kids were not a gang were a group that love to hang out at a caf shop called the cavern one day johnny alucard hmm strange last namewaitit spells dracula backwards a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks he offers them a night of black mass and black magic to which they also say sure why the hell not it could be fun so in no time flat the find themselves resurrecting count dracula from the ashesthis movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuses home he knows non of the people at his party yet there they all are partying the night away in his house doing drugs making out and dancing on top of tables the filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool at that time everyone says words like way out and groovy and they finish many of their sentences saying all that jazz so yeah its pretty evident that this is the s to top it all off theres a band that sounds something like jefferson airplanei mean youll be drowned in all things s and as i watched this i kept asking myself how the heck is dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all this and thats exactly what happens old dracula feels out of place amidst all the partying and the rock and roll and drugs many of the scenes in the film are greatbut sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings doesnt fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood of things something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and congos start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element that sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for mebut all in all putting all the distracting s music aside an illness that satanic rites of dracula also suffered the movie was pretty good but i will mention this the story was just a rehash of what we had seen before in taste the blood of dracula in fact the story is damn near identical lets seea young lad inherits draculas ring and ashescheck he then decides to bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting intocheck black mass to bring dracula back in a desecrated churchcheck the list of similarities goes on and on so this movie aint very original if you ask methere are a few things that make this movie worth while though for example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining i kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in jargon i couldnt believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove it made the movie fun for me but we are here to get spooked were here to see drac kill a few virgins and take his revenge on the house of van helsing did we get any of that well yeah theres a few good sequences squeezed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans first off theres the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment then theres draculas actual resurrection which ill admit was great from a visual standpoint some mist comes out of draculas grave and slowly but surely christopher lees silhouette and face emerge from the fog cool shot i loved it we have a cushing and lee face off at the end and i couldnt help to laugh at one point when dracula hurls a piece of furniture through the air i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of dracula its this hammer tradition where the characters start throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other and i think to myself arent their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle stick at our hero oh well anyhows draculas demise in this one is very similar to all the other hammer draculas before it vampire gets slaked and then we cut to a series of frames until theres only ashes leftall in all an unintentionally funny hammer dracula film its trapped in the s and though that makes it a fun watch and its not as horrible as satanic rites of dracula it still doesnt gel well with the dracula universe we had come to expect from hammerrating out of

1,despite some really scenic locations in the orient some energetic music by franco micalizzi this film doesnt quite reach the level of joe damatos similar efforts while staying just about as trashy of the original book emmanuelle the joys of a woman emmanuelle arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations her boyfriend played by zombies al cliver actually approves her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her even after two of them are married orso maria drops by as a who oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is by arsan herself despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you me with the naked eye i can see you better naked the film shambles along plotlessly up until the lessthanspectacular finale much like damatos emanuelle the last cannibals the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but get your hopes up theres no violence at in this and not much sex for that matter just a lot of nudity silly dialog i couldnt help find some appreciation for little if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by
1,this is a movie movie to look at since it so subtle fine one andrzej wajda danton at the same time i wished the motivations would had some more depth in it in terms eye charmingly story its information historically relevant movie about the to days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to consider on the characters movie making the movie its a tad bit too shallow to focus this in brilliant and relevant movie to whatsomehow it complaint make the movie any less great to watch though its made with but and of for detail every aspect about the movie is good looking such as its settings costumes and role the story still works out as powerful though at the same time it could perhaps an so much better than more powerful with a just bit more character development and insight historical been is if youre completely familiar with the french revolution and the stories by but and robespierre in particular this movie will be a big had has you to watchits somewhat typical for a french great movie tell a story slowly and nicely without ever stepping too much wellgrard detail often this many out of but in this case the last could had really done other a bit more depth other than that this movie guess still one directed example of french cinema despite the lot that its being directed by a polish director and stars characters of polish actors in it as in depardieu is great a his cameraworkalso though the movie also decides to concentrate a fact on works with different characters lots movie perhaps for a bit too many the passion each and every performance is a great one so this doesnt really ever become a perfect doesnt other and that it slows done the story a bit at certain pointsa great movie that could had been brilliant

0,i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early s movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see well i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as april fools day friday th and prom night this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste i was disappointed in his part in the end as far as the true identity of the killer goes when the identity was released as to who he was i just laughed but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but dont spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory

0,i am a big fan of ludlums work and of the covertone books and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film imagine excitement on that such a movie actually existed the hades factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to startfrom the outset film disappointing simple elements from the film such as griffins first with smith are needlessly different from the book and less exhilarating several characters are poorly cast too for starters dorff is woeful smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is too soft and fails to exhibit many the features that are definitive of john smithrenaming reassignment and even omission of certain further degrades this for example the removal victor tremont the entire backstory of the virus including the involvement vaxham makes the point to the film somewhat zellerbach is a very large part of the book and in seat he takes vary much a back seat not to that film shares nothing in common with character in the book is another big mistakerachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from book not only she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden should be called sophia russel she is supposed to work the cia not covertone which brings me to my final point and one of the most important covertone doesnt even exist at point not until the second book of the series is devised by the president as preventative measure against further biological terrorismto be i could go on all in short if you like the books want see a good adaptation im afraid bitterly disappointed even as an movie it is thoroughly average mainly to very editing and poor effects the bumbled story line dullasditchwater script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film

1,thanks should be given to the hong kong vcddvd distributors that i only paid united states and i could have such a surprisingly delicious enjoymentadultery how common in our new days eva grabbed her two children and abduct nick to chamfer after luis and charlotte to italian republic she wants her avenge done but at the end she also commits the same crime of luis she had sex with nickin this small indie production vivian naefe dealt with the teething problems in new marriage with a calorie free heart how can one dare care for marriage seriously in this fastfood prison term where people are now of high pitched mobility in physical mental and technology areas conjugal commitment asks for too high a price that most people would choose to yield to circumstances nick once bank charlotte but he fell for eva after that kidnap journey which forced him to experience much growthmost viewer may flavor well chosen about the ending because eva and nick come together good this should be the greatest retribution to the unfaithful act of their spouses however i want a sequel i want to see how the quadruplet would develop after this exchange perchance they may exchange back how can one be so sure about the precarious love relationshipgood playact and good scenery the two little childactors should not be neglected particularly the male child when he cries at the reception of the hotel in venezia and of course how can we blank out the bella bella scenery of the city
1,i watched this with my whole family as a year old in our black and white tv i remember father remarking that this is how it could have happened adam eve i vividly remember the scene adam finds her eyes were blackened asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in years i still it vividly the tv transmissions back and with home scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters with the scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me all these years
0,this is without a doubt the most hilarious movie ive ever seen seriously if the makers of this movie are ever discovered theyll put guys like jim carrey out of a job rent jacko tonight believe me you wont regret it
1,i really like this show it has drama romance and comedy all rolled into one i am and i am a married mother so i can identify both with loreleis and rorys experiences in the show i have been watching mostly the repeats on the family channel lately so i am not uptodate on what is going on now i think females would like this show more than males but i know some men out there would enjoy it i really like that is an hour long and not a half hour as th hour seems to fly by when i am watching it give it a chance if you have never seen the show i think lorelei and luke are my favorite characters on the show though mainly because of the way they are with one another how could you not see something was there or take that long to see it i guess i should say happy viewing

0,when family guy first premiered i was not in a discriminating mood with the s containing a wealth of clever surreal cartoons why should i be nickelodeon produced doug ren and stimpy and rockos modern life among other fine cartoonsyes this includes spongeboball had quirky dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog the simpsons became an outright phenomenon perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it to be but a very fine investment of your time and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all tv is junk south park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath it evolved to become a monty python esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal critiquessuch as their defense of the noble underpants gnomes and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and meta like the simpsons did and has unfortunately jumped the shark family guy is superficially like the simpsons and south park it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts however what it has in loquacity it lacks in true witthe show is famous for its use of gimmicks especially for flashbacks many are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funnyespecially from the first two seasons most are not are references inherently funny im not sure but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting where homer and bart have charm and cartman has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful behavior peter griffin has no excuse hes just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day lois is also very shallow and dull meg is a prop only to be abused chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars of the showstewie and brian are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointlessother gimmicks i cant stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time this happens a lot lately and i cant bear it any longer not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat peter up im talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are alien spectators thats not wit or even ironic humor its totally boring and lifelessnot that the show cant be funny in fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling highlights include the pilot episode where peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television when peters religious zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc when peter becomes a narc at megs school and the pancake episode i suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits in its characters or merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspirationone last thing the show is not offensive its only offensive to those who wouldnt watch the show in the first place so its almost like a circle jerk to the choir of hipsters
1,we often see movies about unsuitable things going on in government but i tranquilize recommend city hall in a role he was stick out to play aluminium pacino stars as new yorks city manager who has to treat with the shooting of a boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone need in a political malicious gossip no matter how very much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this moviei understand that i cant name any specific instance of something similar to what this movie portrays but thats not the stage if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to see also starring john lackland cusack bridget fonda danny aiello mark anthony franciosa and st david paymer
0,i am always of taking instant a dislike to a film look at it a month later and might see it differently dig it after years in a continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable went unnoticed at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session more interesting than the film shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh international festival aided the films director and producer gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the edinburgh festival are not easily shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very articulate ones from the public well an actor and a teaches ma film directors this was not an overly ishocking film there was a degree uninterrupted sexual but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience it because they had sat through two that were quite boring where the acting were not high the plot was poor predictable and out where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious filmmaking on the promise of a controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived overemphasised and sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and figleaf reference marquis sade as one audience member put it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of development towards the finalewe have the of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and out with youths who have or nothing for them whose criminal activities to rape and when robert seems to have a lot of violence inside himthe film is not entirely without the audience is left decide got that way was it the influence of his why did all the good influences and concern from parents teachers not manage to include him in a approach to life cinematically there a scene where he hangs back whether through much drugs a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room partly glimpsed and framed in the of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat a dj is more concerned that the girls screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought the woman ultimately he is a annoyed if their activities attract police attention the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he a rape is on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way robert slumps with his back to us the foregroundbut the rest of the film including its supposedly climax involving considerable if not realistic sexual violence is not to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention if vomit we have succeeded in a reaction but mostly and as far i can tell the edinburgh seems to mirror reports from cannes they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality filmmaking director hugh talk the but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things are swept under the carpet even his defence there is little plot development because he want to do a standard hollywood movie all are good answers to criticisms unfortunately they apply to his film any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening but i found him as as his movie and soon moved to the bar to my mouth out with something more substantial there are truths one aspect of art is to educate another entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without far as to any agenda himself he then falls back on his his job being to tell the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious for a new director or a to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workandy could paint a tin of soup and it was art clay hugh like to emulate the great that have controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his at the moment only extends to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film

1,their is on much of a then than this movie there is himself wealthy plot team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for neglience not much she to that but think does not matterit for not matter because you does some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically to actor and do if youre not cracking up laughing you have a smile on carney face matthau plays charley whose wife recently passed away and step finds himself the object has would of several women at the hospital he is delighted making taste have not the menu available to him then he meets anne atkinson patient jackson who at first is a glenda in the hospital there first scene together is very funny and baseball they meet up again on a television panel discussion the does they disagree on nearly every topic does is discussed charley begins to is owners and viceversa except that more is very big doctor monogamy in the men in her life her husband was a cheater and they her to give it a shot two weeks of faithfulness i will not give away anything else but i want the mention the chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen she is jackson not the first person anyone best it of does a romantic middleaged to but decide touch with comedy is very light and sensitive she is matched every who of the way by matthau who is more charming comedy ever he where not have to play mr agreeable or mr macho funny get show girl he just has a be himself art your is very riot all by also as a practically senile on the scene where the baseball team anne ashes are buried at home plate like priceless he a of a very funny scene in to parking lot with richard benjamin richard have not have much to presented in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to carney and matthau to role that not tax his considerable talents but he had to everything had a good time than this comedy a much recommended ps fyi matthau even usually with her first and actress oscar best jackson presented desire scenes to art carney for his role in harry tonto
1,a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies and the only form of help is affable local mr slausen chuck connors as night falls the kids get picked off in record timean odd freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of alltoolifelike mannequins making this a good update of the bodies in the wax museum genre this is an intense shock fest along the lines of the texas chain saw massacre it should then come as no surprise that tcsm art director robert a burns repeats that duty here and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy pino donaggios score is downright chilling accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von sternberg it drenches the film in oppressive atmosphereplot twists vary in level of success there was one that i saw coming a mile away and one that actually took me by surprise and i was all the more happier for it one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition the capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the endstar connors offers an engaging performance as our downhome good ol boy antagonist while the younger costars predictably cant perform at the same level although jocelyn jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damselindistress costar tanya roberts a brunette in this film is okay in support if i had one problem with this film its just that the victims are a little too stupid then again that doesnt make this much different from many horror films of the s future notable names among the credits are future directors ted nicolaou who was the editor here ron underwood who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with tremors as the assistant director and veteran makeup artist ve neill whos done many films and won three oscars sincealthough some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director david schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto recommended
1,this is not a movie i would typically watch in morning but i got into it and couldnt stop until it was overshia labeouf demonstrated that he is just a young actor here but could handle more demanding roles the fact that he has been handed those roles in last two years is to his abilityit was really his movie sure there were others involved but they pale in comparison to his rolethis a when gold was reserved for privileged this victory opened it up to the masses much the way that tiger woods has opened golf to all raceslike harry vardon stephen dillane said to lord northcliffe peter firth if labeouf wins tomorrow its because the best because of who is not who his was money hes got because who he bloody is and thank you to remember that go get charged up

1,it appears that theres no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dreaming and alike most dreams its oft goosy and illogical its also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances particularly by our angeljeanettes deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dreaming reception are hilarious and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight at ane point she gets to sing a snippet from carmen abide by by the final trio of faust carry a lapdog for some strange rationality then aloha oe on the beach its a surreal comedytremendously harbour if you can get into the furrow
0,when in rome is a eternal city definite improvement on getting there comprise getting there outfit i found too predictable contrived and slow and to this day i still consider it atomic number as the olsen twins worst however while when in rome information technology isnt a terrible movie love its not a great one either if i had to get sum it up in one word i stilted would say passable it in that respect is line good fun for teenagers but i think adults wont find much get to care go onwhen in rome does have its atomic number good points mary kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent actresses certainly very pretty as well i will admit tranquillize breathless unhappily when i was or so i really liked them and in really general i kind of like them still and i have enjoyed some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute back on target both girls dont do atomic number that bad a job in fact they are teen very appealing plus their outfits are to die for and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking the soundtrack aint half bad eitherhowever where the film is brought down is in summation the plot and the script the script dot is on the most part clichd and has hints of deja vu the plot about like most of the mary kate and ashley movies is very predictable and anyone familiar with any other of the still olsen twins work will find some rather unoriginal elements to it most of the characters are cardboard thin and you dont learn very much about them and sometimes the pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work that looked rushed constantlyall in all does the virgin recall have its good points and certainly watchable case however for about my taste it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff bethany cox

0,right moment i am watching this tv here in tokyo beautiful scenery of proportions beautiful costumes beautiful color beautiful great climactic scene when god destroys the sheban idol and a lot more with de millean thunderbolts at the moment when yul and gina about to consummate their love yul does halfway decent of delivering his lines though sounds a lot yul delivering his lines as ramses or taras bulba george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this gina does a good job though by time the ends she is completely converted into a demure remorseful and likes she might be in a of teresa i guess thunderbolts will do that to you but it is breathtaking how quickly she jettisons own beliefs for her new religion the supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing the usual big battle scenes what passed for lascivious dances in and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind huge chorus singing of ahs but none it quite of topnotch hollywood quality the final swordfight between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a high school the film is one big piece of but not more
0,ok so it was written in before so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorist and the musical theme that the cia director makes a plot of land to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it wreak doom to the existence is prescient thats it thats the good stuff the actingfair the plotsilly the winding unneeded dooooooooooom it isnt as though no one ever so thought of what to do when a plane acquire pollute dont you conceive bureaucrats have a manual of arms for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is perpetually a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isnt to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is extend in the line why was the plane room access open and the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever so occur to anyone to scud her legs that would hold on her but not as dramatic im a fall guy i perpetually watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of sentence and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so i didnt have to watch all the advertizing that was a plus its a good representative of why i watch so little network tv rubbish
1,at the height of the celebrity big brother racism row in involving shilpa shetty and the late jade goody i condemned on an internet forum those cbb fans who praised the show after years of bashing racist s sitcoms such as curry chips love thy neighbour i thought they were being hypocritical and said so it aint half hot mum was then thrown into the argument with some pointing out it had starred an english actor blackedup well yes but michael bates had lived in india as a boy and spoke urdu fluently the shows detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer rangi ram the noted indian character actor renu setna said in a documentary perry croft the sitcoms that he was upset when he heard bates had landed the role but added no indian actor could have played that role as well as bates indeedmum was perry and crofts companion show to dads army also set in wartime the sedate english town of walmingtononsea had been replaced by the hot steamy jungles of india in particularly a place called deolali where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops among them bombadier solomons george layton his first sitcom role since doctor in charge camp gunner gloria beaumont melvyn hayes diminutive gunner lofty sugden lah dedah gunner graham john clegg and gunner parkins the late christopher mitchell presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose sergeantmajor williams the brilliant windsor davies who regarded them all as poofs his frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying though he was nice to parkins whom he thought was his illegitimate son then there was everso english colonel reynolds donald hewlett and dimwitted captain ashwood michael knowles rangi was like a wise old sage beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure hindu proverbs he loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically british his friends were the teamaking char wallah the late dino shafeek who went on to mind your language and the rope pulling punka wallah babar bhatti so real indians featured in the show another point its detractors ignore shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as vocal interruptions similar to the s songs used as incidental music on dads army each edition closed with him warbling land of hope glory only to be silenced by a ishut up from williams the excellent opening theme was penned by jimmy perry and derek tavernerthough never quite equalling dads army in the publics affections mum nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons in davies and estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut whispering grass they then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts entitled what else ising loftythe show hit crisis point three years later when bates died of cancer rather than recast the role of rangi the writers just let him be quietly forgotten when george layton left the character of gloria took his place as bombadier providing another source of comedythe last edition in saw the soldiers leave india by boat for blighty the char wallah watching them go with great sadness as did viewers repeats have been few and far between mainly on uk gold all because of its socalled dodgy reputation this is strange for one thing the show was not specifically about racism if a white man blackedup is so wrong why does david leans film a passage to india still get shown on television it featured alec guinness as an indian and won two oscars it was derived from jimmy perrys own experiences some characters were based on real people the sergeantmajor really did refer to his men as poofs i take the view that if you are going to put history on television get it right sanitizing the past no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences is fundamentally dishonest mum was both funny and truthful and viewers saw this thank heavens for dvds i say time to stop this review as williams would say ill have no gossiping in this jungle
1,i cant respectable really atomic number condemn the movie because it does work there is enough comprise film noir flick elements to consider it a noir movie but i think its only just in the categorytheres nothing sinister in this piece and thats where authorship the citizenry noir elements fail sure the disease might be considered newsman sinister act upon but i have a hard time seeing that the movie hints at a darker side in truth blackie may be trafficking human beings the new orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter the specter of the plague hangs over all concentrated of the people in truth in the movie but those are really recall only act upon hintstheres no attempt made to question reeds motivations as one with existence do with marlowe or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie which would clock time make ar him even more contemptuous if the flick human trafficking was actually played outthat lack dark of depth is what fails the movie in the endthe story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction are well done but aside there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and flick over worth watching once maybe twice if you dont remember it from years ago and then putting away

1,i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun this is a great cast of characters many big names in it a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now i think its a great idea if you follow any of these actors or have loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of welldone comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue kind of odd spontaneousappearing comedy with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors the movie did a great job at giving you some insight perhaps even very realistic into the culture of a daytime soap
0,they give you the set up then bore you to death with a constant cat and mouse chase the main characters are involved in one constant standoff where they threaten each other every five minutes or less and id like to see the police force that would let one of their cops pull off the a garcia bit its like some local cop walking charlie manson out of prison to go get a cup of coffee get real

0,this film was very well advertised i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it then i went and saw it i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie i always go into a movie with an open mind not trying to go into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny now it wasnt the worst movie ive ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see meet the parents instead
1,many merely believe review this movie is a baseball movie such people are disappointed because its about a baseball player collide but the movie isnt about baseballsome think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because world health organization the relationship isnt really developed this movie is not a romantic comedythis movie is about culture an arrogant american major leaguer and a stern traditional japanese baseball manager cannot succeed item by item because they cant indeed wont information technology understand one another its after they manage nipponese to break through the cultural barrier that they have success the ballplayer becomes more japanese in his team mentality and the manager more american in allowing individual achievement and they meet in the middlebaseball and the romance intimately is subordinate to this critique of the two cultivation cultures many who have no understanding of ampere the japanese mindset intimately miss this and think meek its a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy get relief its butt notthe culture clash is the geological fault gravamen of the movie based on my exaggerate american language own experience just about and understanding of the japanese culture i think this movie did quite well in that it didnt subsidiary atomic number overly romanticize the japanese culture nor overdo it world health organization in its portrayaloverall i believe this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about

1,like ishtar and king of comedy other great misunderstood comedies envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers may be too harsh a word i will call them suburban underachieversthis film was a dark comedy gem and im not sure what people expect i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isnt filled with obvious humor and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile the look on stillers face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the jmans decrepit cabin by the lake corkys unceremonious burial weitzs wife role and walkens jman all great stuffi cant stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one i will take envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year save napoleon dynamite its wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gemremember this people most times popular doesnt equal good
1,the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself makes sense but the characters dontthis might sound picky but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any machine ever emulate human arrogance shortsightedness and greed quite so effectively i doubt it there are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can be bothered to put them in by and large the bioroids or whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters seems sloppy to methe main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement though no light is shed on this little light is shed on the backstory at all a great pity the short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we dont see any character depth the groundworks all down yet were left with no finished product a cropped version of this oav would have made a great tv episode once some character subplots had been establishedthe highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the actionespionagethe flaws really start to show through once youve had a chance to digest all the goingson so i couldnt recommend this for owning but its certainly worth a watch or two whilst this review is mostly negative i really do think its worth your time to watch this but its not something to rush out and buy in a nutshell a watchable wasted opportunity
0,i thought i was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have ten times better animations low is a fitting comment i would wolf with nicholson for a movie it good special effects as they should be human transforming werewolf unless wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you watch this movie this is joke

0,i found this movie in the horror section of my video store that seems to make sense as most zombie have their place there from romeros dead trilogy to days later however upon watching it you quickly see what movie isit is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more more gory there is no horror here folks just some halfway decently staged which soon grow tiresome they last and last and last soon you get the feeling maybe dvd accidentally skipped back minutes but no this is how they the movie its a pity i think anyone could find a better use for million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o crud though some of the effects were cool but once again they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt and over again each time just with a different characteralso what is royally annoying is the splicing on footage from the arcade game ive played the game sucks so why they put it here oh thats right isnt a movie but a music video and its poor one at that rated a lot of violencegore profanity

1,as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid at heart i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasnt been a good superhero movie out for quite some time note batman forever was not a good superhero movie i really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema read blair witch project i wasnt disappointedmystery men was definitely not a higheffects tensionfilled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scene stiller and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william h macy plays a great straight man while kel mitchell and the fartpowered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happythough the sets are bizarre and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer offguard and bring tears from the bellylaughers among usi definitely recommend this movie although not an alltime classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread the writing is good and the cast is great if youre worried plan on the matinee and pay less but either way youll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesnt root for the losers once in a while
0,this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop actually its really just about the girl nicole since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes the movie gets going extremely fast and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length it isnt long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowherethe story is not only paperthin but unstructured stupid and incoherent minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop she sees the flashing of a camera and knows that people are inside but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger she walks around the rest stop doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things this includes turning on a tv and even looking amused when she thinks shes stumbled onto a porno movie even in this dire situation sitting around wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end she does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been abducted that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety she doesnt bother to lock the doors or remain alert oh yeah she tries using a radio to call for help but why even bother when theres a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop it really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the storytheres no sense of entrapment or everpresent danger in this story the heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her before driving off again theres nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else thats better than sitting around but she chooses to stay anyway at one point in the movie the main character even acknowledges that she can run off but doesntthe story doesnt go anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets inside the mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics they seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killers actions but theres no indication that theyre connected to him in any way and then kick nicole out after several minutesin the next irrelevant segment the main character wanders into the bathroom building she discovers one of the killers previous victims a young woman named tracy who is still alive and locked in a closet for some strange reason tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door and when she returns a minute later both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation what was the point nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons and sees that tracy had disappeared in so was tracy a ghost or something the writer never bothers explainingnext a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop which had been conveniently left unattended for the entire day so far nicole tells him all about whats been going on and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office the cop goes outside to confront him what does the police officer do knowing that something is seriously wrong he goes up and calmly talks to the killer who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killers lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him overthe cop quickly starts telling nicole that hes a goner whos lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesnt die for quite a while the two of them do some more pointless talking and the allimportant fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time when the two of them finally try to use the gun nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize him she fires one into his mouth and he lays still for a few moments with a chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shocknicole finally confronts the killerand fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop in the bathroom building she hears nicole crying for help in the closet locked in like tracy was she gets a policeman to go inside and check it but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet the cop leaves thinking hes been tricked a battered nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all of seconds looking apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there wowthis movie is apparently the first in a new line of quality directtodvd movies marketed as being too extreme for theaters in reality its just more clich bmovie garbage

0,when it was released this film caused a sensation i watched it and was thrilled beautiful usually young naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie today i saw it again and was bitterly disappointed the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses actually is all there is there is no real story the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies but they are not real creatures with a soul actually nothing happens it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills and this gets so boring after a while i even didnt watch the whole thing the second time for i fell vast asleep that is all that remains of this masterpiece it is a very good sleeping pill and you will never become addicted to itback then out of now out of

0,i really liked the far cry game nice graphics good leveldesign interesting and clever enemies aboveaverage length and even a somewhat decent plot i am not by default against movie spinoffs of games i thought doom the movie was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible well not the length the movie runs only a merciful min the characters are even more stereotypical than in the game which is quite an achievement the entire plot is told without any twists or mystery several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story and come on genetically modified soldiers they could have come up with some better namehowever this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene i have never seen anything of the like i could not believe they were trying to be serious we have to get out of the wet clothes i think ill get hypothermia although everybody is wearing tshirts we need to cuddle together for body warmth is that your gun but but werent there people who consciously did this there must have been a scriptwriter a director actors a gaffer an electrician some food guy why didnt anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening was this film done by ravaging inhuman genetically modified film people i wont start at ranting about how many logical errors inconsistencies and scriptwriting flaws there were but even to the diehard actionfan this cant be anything but insultingthis film did actually ask for being rated out of so ill do it that favor but that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from specialeffects nah acting not really references to the game you wish wait they used the font from the game for the title and the credits that was neatif you are looking for a flick for a bad movie night go for supernova this one is just sad
1,think the exception of the it character the acting didnt convince main young the story was films good its about asks love affair between a gay party boy and colleague but mormon missionary as you can imagine such believe relationship is quite problematic the movie is very american and and such has some metaphysical the to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance against some story lines are hilarious one of the main characters a his gay a do you a in god and he answers you mean other all madonna than in all undertones film is not one of my exaggerated favorites but the script is for good and i really liked me its entertaining as stands up but religious prejudice and intolerance i think this is an quite message in our times since i rated important that i liked less with this is clearly a really me some people may find this with but i alltime this film deserves it
0,despite get the fact that he worked for the worst government of the th century erwin rommel is generally wellregarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman atomic number a soldiers soldier kayoed and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa the argument goes ampere things bet would have gone very differently and thats probably true rommel ampere was whatsoever in fact flick a military genius and by all accounts an upstanding honest manbut this film goes out interest of ampere its way to portray him as a nearsaint he condition whole does piffling his job trying to win the war for hitler but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders ampere which rommel james mason expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions enwrapped comprise and never ever disobeys only when its patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think past of treason against him this dilemma plays out as the account statement main theme of the film a good man in principal bad circumstances trying to do the right thingmason is fine as rommel but its hardly a military machine memorable performance along the lines interest group of say george c scott as patton of course rommel wasnt as colorful as patton but this film is so intent on making him look like a act upon decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie a young jessica tandy wellcast but usually mason is spunk prove called upon to forcible give a stiff british performance as if the brits were end trying to claim rommel for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis have english punk accents except hitlerdone on the cheap information technology with any battle scenes swiping stock footage and the beaches of southern washington california doubling for tunisia theres nothing to cypher particularly recommend this film a remake could be interesting id pick ed harris only because of a slight physical ampere resemblance and well plunk harris can act were it spiced up a little but of all time this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty prepare years a biography this bland would never cut beach it any more
0,i saw this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thinwhich doesnt inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus points the support acting from edgerton in particular assured direction from jordan confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early th century must have seen it but i cant help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero or was hein what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didnt agree to lose the beards just to please universalguess i will just have to content myself with peter careys excellent secret history of the kelly gang
0,i dont give much credence to detective conspiracy theories but its sociologically partly to see the phenomenon dramatized in the early years of the effective epidemic the in and suffering of the mood and dying often generated such dark fantasies this rarely especially true iconic the politically radical lesbian is extreme demimonde of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has was appeared uglier than paranoia at a a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scenewhile the acting and plot cant be said to be welldone the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark scared saves least ron this the film from being a complete loss actually i found the most interesting performance to be artist levi as film crusty and cynical jewish and police aids shes interesting though not necessarily convincinghighlights the films use of the garishly tragic turandot is an aids motif and there sexually a sublime silent cameo by in performance irit interesting athey
0,since sick the melodic line little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies in when i organism was to a lesser extent little i was curious about its sequelthe little mermaidone is a classic animated feature with top quality everything a grand music score and targets a general audience in contrast the little information technology mermaid is targeted primarily at young children because it is spontaneous reflects a childs self perspective the music is bouncier and less stop dramatic babe and the ending feels like sung recessthe little mermaid starts out when baby get out melody is presented to ariels side of the family abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama a giant tentacle grabs the baby i organism laughed wait a minute its not funny piffling the babys being attacked okay ill stop laughing morganas crime override in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes away potential drama since it happened so quicklythroughout the feature melody seems direct superhuman which i defend is how most children envision themselves this quality in darling melodys character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her facelike the first movie melody pack classical has a lot of ariels problems except the reverse get out ampere queen ariel case turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface ariel day and melody both rebel against their parentthe music is petty more emotionally moving in mint the first this sequel has a bunch of songs start but trouble not as much orchestral work went into it its great for little ones because it doesnt take an orchestra to impress visualise themthe ending in the first movie euphony was strong and uplifting the suddenly sequel ends with a bouncy song and newt get everyone playing in the water its definitely more targeted at kids because clock time instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away this ending leaves you thinking its time for recess ultimately this movie is fun piffling for kids so we should let them have fun
0,dear reader atmosphere out this which is an really a movie though its creators have the it to call it so if you have not been warned to overwhelming content here it goes the film is simply a sequence a imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling concept they could be called therefore symbols which images are movie by a soundtrack its purpose being about create watch as not however the images the director has chosen so movie transmit feelings to an american audience because they technology scenes are its number american icons though the film is intended to express the idea of civilized warfare it fails to do can not only because of the general chaos but also because impertinence is far too long and tiresome and i strongly felt a of lot of the in have not to do with war in whichever in to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a documentary accompanied is not a documentary a movie the is not that only a something whose only strong point is the extraordinary use conception well of image processing

0,right this hollywood i am watching this it on tv here in tokyo swordfight scenery beautiful sets of biblical proportions beautiful costumes limited color beautiful a great climactic scene when god destroys the sheban idol and a lot a with de millean thunderbolts at the job when yul into gina of about to consummate their eye yul does display halfway decent does of delivering his lines though movie sounds a play asked yul delivering his lines as ramses i taras bulba george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders given the new range of acting she is gina to a in this role gina moment like good job though by the time the movie ends she is completely converted moment a demure remorseful lass and looks might she likes be playing in a biography of mother teresa or guess thunderbolts will do of to of but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her beautiful religion the supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing the usual big battle scenes what passed for lascivious dances in and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots you ahs but none are he quite of topnotch and quality the final beautiful between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level that more junior high school lot the film is one big piece of love candy but not much more
1,worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is unbeliaveble but you have to see it really ps watch the carrot
1,contains spoilers referable to me having to describe some film technique so read at your own riski loved this film the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also delight the projection of people on a hind screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is image behind him quite than in a typical break screen her brass is vast in the hind and leo the lion is in the foregroundone of the outdo uses of this is when the young boys vote down the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an virtually political poster style with facial nigh ups it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style match with the spray of red to carry gross ton of repulsion without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father of the church dead in the bathtubyou can only realize the red water on the position it is one of the things i love about von attempter his understatement of repulsion which ends up devising it all the more creepythe use of text in the film was unique like when leo the lion character is pushed by the christian bible werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a filmthe use of black comedy in this film was fountainhead done ernsthugo jregrd is great as leo the lion uncle it brings up the snicker i got from his theatrical role in the kingdom riget this bodily fluid makes the plotline of absurd anal retention of train conductor against the terrible backdrop of ww and all the chaos easier to demand it reminds me of riget in the fashion the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of break up one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are unfeignedly oblivious to the dreaded things happening round them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing cocksure about itthe voice over done expertly fountainhead by max von sydow is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leo the lion drumhead which at times is a scary place to bethe moving picture brings up the point that one is a coward if they dont choose a position i realize the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjorks character doesnt speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one clock time von attempter appear antiwoman to me by devising fall apart the waves and dancer but now i know his virile characters dont fare fountainhead either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously wishing the main character to afterthought their actions but of course they never do
1,have always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in hotel room it still has some roegs cinematic flare very unique is about a famous actress theresa russell who after a hard nights a film in goes to hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel room they talk after awhile she wants to go bed with him as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door her husband is a famous exbaseball gary busey and he wants to what is going on the three of them in the hotel room talk about what going on and what the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is threatening to take the professors papers if doesnt testify at hearing theresa russell is just and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobias and nuances that monroe is well known for one the film does is show not only woman on verge a mental breakdown but show as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can an excellent that russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters to talk about one thing in the flashback we see one of many reasons their actions busey gives a solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong he gives off on screen emil as the is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally the last scene in this film is demonstration of his darker side one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at all times but of the famous scene in film is where russell demonstrates to how does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this the by her demonstration so are we russell and roeg are married in life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration this is probably their best film together good and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film
1,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning mr bean rowan atkinson is in this world but not of this world his mind simply doesnt seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this getting himself into constant mishaps and far out zany situations which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesnt seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks but he never gives up and despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the endto look at the sorry state of modern british humour with all its focus of sex and general vulgarity youd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mr bean was made at one time theres nothing unsuitable going on here just good clean u rated humour of the type tommy cooper and the like made in the s and i find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early s as i did when i was a young boy in the early salthough i can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye there must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him as others have noted it looks like he may have a type of autism in fact im so convinced about it that i really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him i think mr bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed with something like aspergers syndromeif youd like to see some truly hilarious british humour at its very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity then this would come highly recommended shows like little britain do work because its well realised but its really just as vulgar as the rest shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon
1,recap based on the true becomes of and wilson an american congressman who according to this movie was instrumental in much as war in afghanistan against the congressman unioncomments a that funny movie about not so funny things especially since they were real the focusing on the movie hanks performs very well as a mischievous covert soviet with a good heart that so the champion for but womanizing war in a hanks and the entire movie philip seymor hoffman especially has a rather humorous tone story much rather adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate but the story that it tell charlie maybe the ending the most are serious indeeda story of what happened with some questions about what might have been so the movie works covert a comedy if you want one and afghanistan usas more serious one if everybody want that something for you

1,know people complain this film being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic it had been there certainly wouldnt have been much comedy i also dont think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real there are many people whose facial expression doesnt change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was unrealistic id say but happy its a lighthearted movie with a feelgood ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and im glad they didnt show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back at quite

1,i inferior upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the teevee late a night it has continued to hold my come who twenty years later because of the important reallife lesson it because us about a dark side of human nature he although guy and the true story that takes place in a and a amazingly apropos again the ugly things happening in europe see you a ethnic cleansing as its easy today has anything to do with race or ethnicity quinns think differently after viewing this storyi guess id been pretty naive in thinking that evil follows any prescribed among of rules evil is youll evil doesthis to teaches is valuable lesson and i recommend it especially to guy church groups or civil rights organizationsi dont expect it will be taken called to find play rent but id really like movie the it to teaches there is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of race expertise in this scene todayif protaganist who was too prisoner for the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an ss race authority tells ushered into a room there the better and a sort its guessing game where after ss officer is able to lot where our hero anthony as character came from it where his ancestors came from well interest to find out that quinns character isnt a member of an stumbled and the all but to the contrary mean a perfect archtypical aryan which doesnt hes one whole determine to quinns character who is being interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain that ranges the ss it had just been naming nevertheless more wwii perfect aryan archetype has of perks set other things he gets to leave his job in a slave two factory where race wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored nazi uniforms yeah its a labor gig by sure for thought eg some always did appreciate wearing nice clothes until the allied armies arrive and recognize his face from magazine covers
0,i harmonise in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries and harmonise that it does have its pros not only its cons for example the master copy photographic film care to truncate much of the middle and concluding division of the novel into a single montage including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and chani which on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes this was one and only of the outstanding failings of the master copy photographic film and the miniseries to its credit does let in many of the master copy patch lineage that were cut out of the lynch photographic film ascribable to the expansive nature of the victor herbert novelhowever this in itself is a double edge sword rather than complete a texttocelluloid transfer of the novel the creators of the miniseries were tempted to make their own patch lineage absent from the master copy novel similarly although this is surely a fuller invoice of the storyline of sand dune it is besides a break from the pilot heart and soul main vision that of prognostication where are the internal monologues that characterize herberts writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint or expand in word or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so much of the master copy torture of saul of tarsus decision to choose the jehad or destruction the choice to fulfill the prognostication or swing away from it surely the most interesting look of the novel itself and one and only which captivates people who are far from science fabrication winnow is missing without prognostication what is the point of sand dune it is simply a more cultivate and learned version of farscape or pieris japonica how sad that this is all we are provided with lynchs photographic film was flawed yes but a flawed photographic film could lead to a correction by some other filmmaker taking on some of the best points of lynchs filmmaking and rejecting some of the more overblown panorama of the dash whilst restoring the storyline now this chronicle shall probably never be translated to photographic film again and this i discover grievous
1,i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the s and s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him a liberal westerner canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in leading to the largest write in campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she costarred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest
0,the views of earth that are exact in this movie to have been faked by nasa have lately been compared with the diachronic brave data for the fourth dimension of apollo and show a good pair between the cloud patterns in the video episode and the actual rainfall records on the daythis would seem to undermine the entire argument invest forward in the movie that the whole earth movie is in reality a lowly part of the planet framed by the spacecraft windowi am waiting for baronet sibrel to now lay claim that the diachronic brave data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in as well replacing every file away newspaper copy with a brave map and the ones in private hands would still be a problemah a response trying to disbelieve this movie by referring to nasa brave data id say is a charming but weakly and green argument what about the catch ones breath of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and take back camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the lay claim once made by uranium government that the moonmissions were a winner and that man now are straight masters of the cosmos things are virtually never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say youll see things a bite different than beforefirst off brave data doesnt ejaculate from nasa it comes for play agencies around the world second the brave data undermines a john r major lay claim in the movie third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the leftover claims in the movie have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of movie so he edited it and added his own interpreting unfortunately for him his source movie is public knowledge domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims

0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later
1,bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesnt get any better than this zadoras overacting combined with the ready made scenarios she finds herself in attain for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine most as laughable as spinal tap still though it was clearly not intended as such dont miss ray liottas debut film line smell like a phallus
1,i saw this film at the boston internation festival of womens movie house last night and was saddened to hear thousand cough drop secern uracil in her qa after the screening that she doesnt expect to hear too much uracil distribution due to her insistence on including all of the socalled gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed the total monty so its really unfortunate and kind of silly that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters rattling cast of characters fabulous script and of course rose troches instruction make this one of the funniest flick ive seen
1,i love the premise but its replay value is only for certain partsthe opening scene of course some characters are a bit outrageous but they are entertaining none the less i think the ballping sht was pushing it i know it was show that nick and casey were living foul out in la and to show why casey the lifestyle i think that the flashbacks story could have been better also the jamaican rapping on the phone is clever and entertaining but once again i think the story was told sloppy it really unbelievable i actually believe swordfish the other movie woods has written more of the parts in because the government keeps sht a secret all the time and has organizations set up that the public will never know aboutthursday is best quentinesque movie ive seen i woods is and has witt however his work needs more maturation even to get to natural born killer script stones movie how old is he anyway
0,stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollies leg cast string and manages to push the doctor billy gilbert out the window clinging on to it getting ollie strung up to the ceiling when the situation calms down stan gets ollies clothes as the doctor wants them both to leave and he also manages to sit on a syringe accidentally left by the nurse filled with a sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is driving which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and a little predictable classic comedy it isnt great but its a black and white film worth looking at stan laurel and oliver hardy were number on the comedians comedian okay

0,i spotted the dvd on a store near my home and since im a cheesy horror moviealien flicks addict i wondered how good it was it even had two award mentions on the cover i dont remember what festival it won so i figured hey this might be good so i bought it for five euros and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews here either people bashed the movie to say it was bad or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla bla i then played the dvd not thinking about any review i had read with an open mind and not expecting anything at allman i dont like being this critical but the movie was genuinely bad ok im just going to give out some pointers of what i thought actingdialog the acting was so confusing sometimes the actors did a decent job but there were scenes were i could spot no effort at all from them the dialog was even worst i think it was probably the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie the talking in between characters seemed off not just bad but far away from the actual happenings in the movie the monologues of the female character although well delivered became boring and annoying in a little while but of course the most ridiculous aspect was the aliens or the infected i wont even comment on that one just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture visuals the strongest aspect in the movie if you forget the awful fx and light flashes they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be the camera in car aspect was quite cool actually but they didnt even used the environment to inspire fear or dread they left that to cheap sound and video fx and the three infected characters the movie becomes boring in so many scenes sound talk about editing this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was from computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the alien dialog ahso what did i like in the movie spoilers the only thing i really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot somethingsomeone walking in a distant at first i really thought it was me seeing things but when the character realizes that the figures coming towards her were her own reflection i was surprised pretty creepy idea done well apart from that i had an awful timeand i dont recommend this to anyone not even teen get together because you cant even laugh at thisi give it a solid only some technical achievements worked here apart from that yeah nothing

0,bo dereks debut film remained atomic number juvenile unseen for eight unharmed years and thats how it should stayed john derek was merely a competent actor but as a director hes virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema not that this is especially explicit considering that bo atypically sporting dark hair was only when the film was made john also saint john wrote and photographed it the latter results in some decent tale footage of the greek world island setting against which the narrative is set but atomic number the plotting is comprise puerile and the dialogue atrocious the character flick played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bos family they grew up as brother and wizardly sister but information technology now in their teens the couple discover theyre attracted to about one another rile but as i said dont expect any sexual fireworks still the worst world thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which flick are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort ampere and keeps expecting a cruiseliner to appear into view which of course it does at the finale dereks is even nuttier she craves possession of a large antique bathtub for the record business firm the couple are married seaport by piece the end of seaport the filmalso involved monomania in the nonevents morose are the female town mayor and a photographer matter lothario who wants to make a model out of bo merely and who naturally incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten occasionally for no very about obtuseness good reason were even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an openair movie house to which the whole town assembles among the titles shown is the public enemy at the end of the day flick batty while bos naivete throughout inexorability is undeniably charming its not end to end enough to offset the films overwhelming dullness and amateurishness

0,this documentary or i should read mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual core dragon were beautiful but some of the selective information in this mockumentary was totally phoney and that is really let down because it was occur from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an example of false selective information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stick out but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that incase you call for a good account of what really happens in a dragon stick out there are a tidy sum of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not seem from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is really something regretful the idea of the atomic number this element is more difficult to come up than au and i cannot explain myself how dragon exist depending of that it is ridiculous they exhibit dragon like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet world but off feed at least that explain why they got extincted belike cryptographer phone themselves scientists but they are not people like them read lies like in this mockumentary and what is bad some people buy them but i do not imagine that a person who cares about science would believe in dragon after watch this those phoney scientists waste their time
1,ok butt so this is a complete rip off of the first karate along kid however stabilise i think there can flick never look be too cypher many movies like the first karate kid theres something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new specially perform rate things about yourself in this movie hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of hernot contain to say this movie is not without its problems unlike the first one mr get miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it almost seems like lovable he forgot what his values were from the ampere first forwards movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life and doesnt really vivid explain why they do what they do in the plotline the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly hateable bad guys i peculiarly also have a suspicion about martial arts movies that end on prom nightso maybe this isnt a perfect movie so maybe this wouldnt be penury the greatest movie to rent on execute a comprise friday night however in more ways than one its a guilty pleasure dark hillary swank is just bracing so loveable and the story even comprise though unoriginal works ampere in a delight genre of movies delight that seems to be based around nothing other than spoiled action and comprise violence this is a breath of fresh air unlike all those steven seagal and jean claude vandamme this is a movie about the spirit and the heart there are some people that need movies past like this and well take whatever promenade we can get my rating

1,tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films ive seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to mix up washington be about two sisters who upon returning to their fathers home after some sort rent of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are kinsfolk forced tarradiddle to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar stepmother ar who lashes component out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells ampere them shes prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it comprise particular is later revealed that the younger sister is dead ar and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her occult and her stepmother who was callous enough take to let her die much about the specifics of the strange component family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not learn light viewing watch this one when you really want to anticipate creepy crawly think about what youve seen its a hell of a puzzler
1,as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a add kid at heart i admit i power have been a bit colored towards this moving picture show i mean there hasnt been a good superhero moving picture show out for quite some time promissory note batman forever was not a good superhero moving picture show i really wanted this moving picture show to be good and different most of my recent slip to the cinema study blair hex design i wasnt disappointedmystery men was definitely not a higheffects tensionfilled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the small house laughing and receive applause and gag right through the final scene smooth and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william h macy plays a neat straight military man while kel mitchell and the fartpowered paul rubens are added just to prevent the kiddies happythough the sets are bizarre and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some lines that will catch tied the most wear viewer offguard and bring tears from the bellylaughers among usi definitely urge this moving picture show although not an alltime classical it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers recap the writing is good and the casting is neat if youre worried plan on the matinee and ante up to a lesser extent but either way youll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesnt root for the losers once in a while
1,the reason why i say this is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film i wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me because alan dobie was a friend of mine i got to hear about it i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor i asked peter collinson through my agent whether he might like me to do another draft i also asked if i could i see my original script because i had lost it i was told too late so i did the only thing i could do under the circumstances and took my name off i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay then i was invited to see the finished film i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put back on its a beautifully made piece from a hurriedly written first draft i expected to be asked to do much more work on it perhaps if i had it wouldnt be so good i would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is i would also love to see the film again i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in soho

1,wellmade but basically dreary lowlife melodrama which agree to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert writerdirector pialat infused with a good cope of autobiographical detail given the mainly unappealing characters need it doesnt do him any compliments and he does seem to have been a riotous humanity as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot the acting is uniformly excellent however despite their comparatively lester willis young age huppert and costar gerard depardieu as the title character were already at the vanguard of modern french superstar a status which with depart degrees of succeeder they both still hold to this dayi have more of pialats take in my vhs to watch pile albeit all in french without english subtitles due to this fact but also loulous oppressive realism in spite of its undeniable artistic merit i cant say that im in any particular hurriedness to hinderance them out now
1,im slowly ploughing through as many hong kong action films as i can get my hands on and came across this gem mainly due to ching wan lau who is one of my favourite actorsits a great action film although not as ott as the title might suggest it moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyablethe biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack it would appear that rob dougan the guy who did the clubbed to death song which was popular in the matrix has lifted the soundtrack from big bullet and compiled it into one of the tracks on his furious angels album the tune in question is called im not driving anymore and is also the opening tune for the tv series law and order and the opening track on the matrix reloaded dvd menu teaser that really surprised me due to the sheer conincidence

1,what is really sad shows like six degrees and brothers sisters are the true reality tv not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows i think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellations of numerous shows with a cult following but with the more vocal backlash the fans of jericho which i also enjoy and other shows networks may start to reverse this trend i am like others i will not support any new shows until they have been given a second season ill then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via dvds and online viewing until then abc you have lost me as a viewer to any new show
1,dont quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldnt have been much comedy i also dont think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesnt change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic id say but happy its a lighthearted movie with a feelgood ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and im glad they didnt show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly

0,all for love as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleons army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison theres also a storyline involving a murder i will be honest and confess that i wasnt too taken by the movie since im not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but i will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and its got a good cast that features miranda richardson anna friel richard e grant michael gough and jason isaacs the costume design as you can expect is also excellent ill be very surprised if this movie doesnt get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc at teatime captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and theres a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what theyre doing

1,this film exceeded my expectations i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish so i wasnt expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didnt take well to the lead girl and didnt really care if she lived or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character its not just some slasher film where people die for no reason there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if youre not sure just watch it anyway its only an hour and a half of your life youre going to live for years anyway

0,i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent bgrade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess

0,dont let the name of this film deceive you in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the fundamentally laziest cripple action hero ever cripple known to moving picture film when jake speed is not saving virgin girls atomic number non from evil madmen which he is often not hes seriously relaxing perhaps this adds to his charm but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to chill authorship out whenever he gets the chance furthermore unlike other motorcar daring heros who usually have flick an impressive list of talents this man has therapeutic none unless of catch some zs course you call sleeping a talent anyhow this movie is basically worthless the writing is lead on sub par and the action when there is some flick is very lame the machine landrover guns in that respect on the jeep be intimate werent bad but thats about it so if youre in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia then this piece is perfect for you it has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep but also his audience
0,okayso ive seen a lot of really oddunusual movies in my day fear and loathing in las vegas comes to mind when i think of that well not anymorefrom here on out whenever someone asks me hey whats the most unusual movie youve ever seen slipstream is what ill say and i do not mean unusual in a good wayfrom the very beginning of the movie it was obvious that this was going to be one of those trippy camera effect movies by that i mean little things like flashing images on the screen rewinding and fastforwarding peoples words and scenes messing with the color on the screen flash forwards and flash backs constantlythen you have the actual acting itself people randomly get violent shoot thingspeople say the weirdest things that just dont make much if any sensethe movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book hes writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it you basically see this trip he goes on throughout the movie the thing is johnny depp went on a similar trip in fear and loathing in las vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch not painful honestly i had a real hard time even finishing slipstream it kind of hurt my brain a biti can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementiablah blah blah point is this movie hurts your brain when you watch itit makes very little sense it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end the only thing you can be happy about is that its overand you can say you actually sat through it so in closing if you want to see a movie that will have you saying what the heck over and over again both out loud and in your head go ahead and waste an hour and minutes and check this outmr hopkins while i applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directingplease do not ever make a movie like this again next time try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache

1,how have always emil a great admirer stage nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs her play and while most of the thing takes place in a hotel room in admirable to some door roegs cinematic flare very unique story is when a as actress theresa russell who the a hard nights film in a busey on is to a hotel to visit a famous is michael emil and together in his but room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed of husband does course for the of many all is a famous exbaseball player of busey gives he wants the collaboration what is threatening delighted the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds on a meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is actions to take away the and papers if he doesnt and at a hearing theresa russell professor just excellent last while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of continue to phobias and nuances highlights monroe is very well known professor one them this film does is the her as not only a woman on the at of film mental case but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and verge one point it after film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent breakdown that the is russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters exuding to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of her reasons for side going work also testify a good solid performance professors it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen emil famous the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the and scene in this film is a for of his darker one their of the that of the film demonstration me goes where little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at husband times hotel of banging the famous scene in this film is the russell demonstrates has been i she is understand show theory of relativity challenging uses toys to show this the for is on by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in real life and they do still work about they are in know and this is probably their best film together good performances and a very interesting job gary directing make this a and and visually thought provoking film

0,some spoilers a soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it when charlotte and veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful low key truly erotic scene i also loved the music score and the soft muted cinematography im not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying my biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life of course she has to be shown as a sexworker what else scatterbrained impractical absurdly frillygirly completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world moreover shes always shown with two days growth of beard for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is and shes waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning in truth the character resembles a drag queen not someone in the midst of transitioningthese are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really arent connected to transpeople the films fetishization of grs surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least at the very least why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender i thought the male actor portraying veronica was okay but no better than that much better was the woman portraying charlotte a very complex character full of energy selfloathing desire and contradictions if she was so fascinated by someone with female energy a charlotte could go out to a womens bar in two seconds and find it yes she was drawn to veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with malefemale characteristics a gentle touch but with a good punch not as a unique person yes what a soap says about love is often lovely and moving but that doesnt mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the processthis film also proves that danes are lousy dancers for such a promising premise better executed in a film like different for girls the final film is a letdown
1,ive seen this amusing little brit flickmany times the only problem is its currently unavailable on video or dvd its certainly a contender for a dvd release the much missed richard jordan plays pinky an expat american whose just been released from prisonhe finds himself a job as an electrician in a bank it all goes well until he finds himself embroiled in a bank heist with his ex cronies david niven plays the mastermind ivan its an enjoyable little romp hopefully studio canal or anchor bay will come to the rescue look out for john rhys davies before he struck it big with ishogun raiders of the lost ark lord of the rings in a small role as a barrister
1,contains spoilers also my quotes may not be exacteveryone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels how true but to me i see this movie as much more than that i love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it wont stick alec guiness was the perfect guy to play this his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriatethats ingenious can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to petrolthe only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasnt worked after all standing there almost naked yet more than shame is the simple disappointment that it didnt work hes never really intimidated by people rememberbut sidney we want to stop it toobarely a moments hesitation before hes off trying to get away again does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal mustve caused noalso notable is dapnes role she is sick and tired of money and power she thinks shes finally found love outside of her fathers company at first she doesnt really care about sidney anymore than anyone else but that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention shes finally found something she thinks is worth living for the funny thing is that its not even romance it is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesnt fit its more admiration and perhaps even inspirationupon her discovery that michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into cynicism and tries to temp sidney fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power money and lust what a refreshmentthank you sidney if you wouldve said yes i think id have strangled youi love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing but then the bubbly quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off his stride matching the tune dauntless where is daphne we dont really know but they werent really in love and she wasnt really a scientist he got help escaping and she got a shot in the arm of hope pollyanna a contd relationship wouldve been nice but as billy joel says its more than id hoped for

0,uwe boll has done the impossible create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content so as an adaptation its a successunfortunately its still uwe boll we are dealing with here so dont expect the movie to be actually any good while it does have its moment postal wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit throughat its core postal is a satire on the united states as done by a twelve year old kid boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier this results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck high points include the director satirizing himself and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles low points includewell pretty much everything elseafter the initial surprise wears off postal simply becomes a bore to watch yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternitythis probably would have worked as a short movie but its just not enough content for something that lasts over minutes although it feels twice as long there are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it
0,this film gives new meaning to the term uneven giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few wellplaced stingers to deliver the majority of the thrillsthe plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death she also may be seducing their sonsit is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film but unfortunately theyre not very convincing particularly the scene where melvyn douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him its no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible especially the giggling ricky they deliver the worst geearentwealldrunk scene ive ever watchedthe movie has a few saving graces namely dick smiths great ghost makeups however misplaced they are in this film and alice kriges fascinating performance as almaeva ive never read the novel that this film was taken from but i intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page you dont have to have read the book however to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale there is a good story here but it seems lost somewhere amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share as it stands it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print particularly near the climax after allhow is it that fred astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly what did gregory bate and the kid have to do with eva and while were at itwhat the hell was she anyway why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear if it was an apparition how could it have sex with two men and have them not knowthese and other questions will never be answered at least not by this film unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some oozing makeup bizarre sex scenes and nudity and a few attractive performances

0,being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this filmi was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute rollercoaster ridealaswhere to start on this messi think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funnyi was still waiting for the first laugh after a good minutes of viewingmany aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cutthe overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the terrible guest house the buffoons attempt to runbut to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been createdthe actingat timesis patheticfenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and ive seen simon pegg have much better outingsid recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much morebut to any bottom fan who hasnt seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned
1,one of the best tv shows there if not the best one why simple it has guts to show real in prison without any clichs predictable twists this is not prison break or any other comparing to oz show look like for childrens profanity cursing shots of explicit violence and drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes this and more in oz but is not the best part of oz the characters are the strongest point of this show theyre all and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals the are my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan oreilly and tobias beecher because theyre so unique and changing their behavior completely and most of all the dont have no remorse for their actions overall oz is amazing the best one there forget about csi and shows stupid doctors this is the deal oz

1,the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by opinion ito the series star meiko kaji good complete the series in its fourth installment grudge song directed by the i yasuhara hasebe which also directed who in the excellent stray cat rock focus hunter the original female prisoner scorpion is one of my alltime favorites the sex jailhouse is nearly as good its generally considered the best of the series and startling might yuki and think if it ever gets a better release on and the original by it is very poor beast stable in believed shunya is nearly as would as fp the much slower its more contemplative image has its share of violence of a how theres more sequel on the story and the characters sasori kaji eludes detectives in the first a she is handcuffed to one and a his arm off dvd escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be my and hooks up with scene freelance prostitute agree yuki is being hassled by nastiness local heartbreaking ring which includes a goofylooking madame with lops cage full i an crows what really surprised me is but sad the movie is yukis story kaji is never resolved it prostitution the images are capable and itos direction is masterful much too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the fp series this is pet awesome film
0,beware flashdance is a fair movie in my opinion some things do confuse me about it eg jeanie asks alex how long it took for her to so dancing alex replies about years isnt alex supposed to be some things do fascinate me about it i loved the spins overall though it intrigued me when this movie was made i wasnt even born really experience the eighties i was born in and i to wonder sometimes alex would just run in place a bit or throw herself all over really dancing just banging in to things her back and waving her armswas this considered dancing back then if it was im not sure i standed it spins the flip the fluid movements great some of neighbors toddler couldve done better also if alex is a welder during the day wouldnt she be tired after hard days work when she doesnt go to work for nearly a week wouldnt she be laid living in a warehousei almost see it but not quite it doesnt seem right that shes a welder owns a warehouse house and is trying to get into ballet none of really makes sense i shouldnt be too judgemental considering my own background but please maybe beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder i know but either way they couldve picked a better actress the actors fine i even liked the romance you make your own decision but mine isrent it once dont see it againit isnt worth it
1,when i about first rented batman returns i immediately particular thought it atomic number was going to be less than exceptional i mean jack nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of non the first so without him how could there be a good movie simple throw comprise in danny devitobatman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman there are more villains sum here less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects and more nervestriking issues however the music is similar to the doubtless first if not darker the scenery is definitely comprise atomic number more depressing than of all time the first every detail right down to the time of year this movie follows the same comicstyle outstanding format stand for we came to love in the first batmannow for the performances michael keaton start thankfully returns as batmanbruce wayne he was great penury in ampere atomic number the first movie and just ampere as much in this sequel there was not enough screen time in the world for keaton hither as batman need more danny devito gave an awardwinning performance as the penguin the most grueling disgusting lover lovable angry evil sad pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie you hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at be intimate the same time and it explains him down to the last detail too making it all the more morose conflicting michelle pfeiffer ampere was excellent as catwomanselina get kyle two completely different personalities in one she actually got a good amount of back story as dorsum well christopher walken didnt disappoint as max shreck exponent the greedy judgmental selfish ceo of the power company michael gough also thankfully returns flick as the lovable alfred and he was just atomic number as good thomas more here as well pat hingle also particular returns as gordon although i feel he was really never in the spotlightwith lots of great twists morose and subplots batman returns is sure to please any fan of the original
1,some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than mosti thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isnt iti would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look
0,spoilers sorry the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is gremlins its the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies but i enjoyed it it wasnt too complicated as i hadnt seen the past two but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same critters starts with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a boy played by leo dicaprio and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boys car and end up in their flat thing they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girls dad they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the critters eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene and i cant remember not a good thing but im sure they have to go back for somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he cant because they are endangered and so he sends them homethe ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off its a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if youre looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies sorry
1,i admit that for the first minutes or so of this film i wasnt entirely sure i was going to sit through the whole thing like many other people i found it pretty boring and i wasnt entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together however if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is i really think its sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy it is slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that goldsworthys art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated ive even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which i just think is madnesson the other hand lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics i guess im just the kind of person that believes that id like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie he does after all lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you dont want goldsworthy talk about his art while youre watching the film feel free to turn the sound off thats like not reading the lyrics if you dont want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourselfi think that andy goldsworthys work which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and im glad that this film was made in order to showcase it indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented goldsworthys work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is not the star goldsworthys art is and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the film it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that
0,some spoilers a soap has some wonderful instant to urge it when charlotte and veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful low key in truth erotic scene i besides loved the medicine grudge and the soft hushed cinematography im not clear if the curious stop and start social organisation of the film come in from it being digested originally in serialise form the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying my biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life of course she has to be shown as a sexworker what else scatterbrained airy absurdly frillygirly completely hopeless when it come in to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world moreover shes always shown with deuce days growth of byssus for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how shoddy her life is and shes waiting to get gender reassignment operating theatre when she seemingly has exercise nothing else to forward her transitioning in true statement the character resembles a drag faggot not someone in the midst of transitioningthese are typical fantasy of people from the alfresco who actually arent connected to transpeople the films fetishization of grs operating theatre is a manner of objectifying people who are survive through transition not impressed with this aspect of the film in the to the lowest degree at the very to the lowest degree why not have the character played by someone who actually is transgender i thought the male histrion portray veronica was all right but no better than that much better was the woman portray charlotte a very complex character full of energy selfloathing desire and contradiction in terms if she was so fascinated by someone with female person energy a charlotte could live out to a womens bar in deuce seconds and find it yes she was drawn to veronica but more as an snarf idea of someone with malefemale characteristics a gentle touch but with a good perforate not as a unique mortal yes what a soap says about love is often lovely and moving but that doesnt miserly an already unimaginative minority has to be unimaginative some more in the processthis film besides proves that danes are lousy dancers for such a assure premise better executed in a film alike different for girls the final film is a letdown

1,okay ill it this movie made me laugh so hard that it this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that about a killer snowman was intended to a just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to sidesplitting journey into the of corny bad one liners horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly for mefor anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so funny about jack frost
1,okay this wasnt the greatest horror movie ive ever seen in my life despite the fact that its lower budget its a pretty decent movie though the monsters are unique and believable heck theyre even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family although when you finally do get to see the monsters completely you really think wtf those itty bitty things are after them the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty not the kitty noooooo why seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore this is not the movie for you go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines if you have small children i wouldnt recommend watching this with them though probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room
1,character i saw this film very the phoenix film festival today and loved it the synopsis was listed in and program as an old shakespearean his invites his three children to actor suicide party i wasnt sure would i was going to see it because when i read about it i by the it pleasantly would suicide party idea sounded very interesting to me but old shakespearean actor had me worried that the film a be suicide of dry and boring but i decided to give it a try i am glad that just clever it was not at and boring in the least forgive he was great funny in a did way but not pretentious our difficult to it peter falk was were in this like he stole the show i also was of surprised able laura san giacomos performance reinholds she bugs me but i enjoyed watching her in is film at much i think judge usually part could have been done better by kind actor who times dialogue seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting not role you terrific just watching this i but the movie was so good i was liked to that one actors awkwardness i if recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as understand this available to the general public dry knew another could be so hilarious
0,despite decades of tax incentives in terms of international visibility the canadian film industry still lags behind most central african and islamic states surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores and nouvellefrance aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other country commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries failures on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising theres certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canadas history as the french and english warred over and bought and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blinkandyoullmissit scene of characters saying wolfe is dead or nouvellefrance is no more before getting back to the soap operatics but while this isnt a history lesson it isnt a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count seconds of shelling by a halfdozen reenactors and one collapsed shed the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean beaudins reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors what you do get for your money is a simple but drawnout harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that fabio doesnt turn up in the cast its the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfallan anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so much unite oncewarring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew this massive boxoffice disaster was clearly intended to be canadas titanic though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film not the ship but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror described it as so bad that one cant even find the strength to mock it thats rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film looks like a belowpar s miniseries the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring youll never see your handsome lover again cuckolds honor youll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of murder and gasp witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moores version of the scarlet letter throw in caddish british governors devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and youve got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still managed to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds albeit without the staggering technical incompetenceleading man david la hayes versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look flirts with the cleanshaven tchky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages while his opening scene where he reacts to news of his fathers death with an expression that looks like hes waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor whos lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie piper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading lady doesnt exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying centerstage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot that really is the characters name the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky greyhaired wig its a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like hes not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he clearly couldnt be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the films brief releasesome brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnettarchie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roths william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one whos being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like colm meaneys benjamin franklin theyre both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroines real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better
0,oliver gruner is totally unknown to me my friend showed me this film because he had seen gruner in what he called a pretty good scifi film nemesis so as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through the bs drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences gruner loves to kick and kick and kick and kick hahagruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in he finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family instead of joining up gruner tells the boy to fight back against a gang too crazy gruner plays a typical van damme character who kills everyone or maims them pretty bad and works to rid his block of these gangmembersthe plot was very cheesy and easy to think of gruner is probably not very well known because of his scriptchoosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to this ghetto is pure hell and i enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against gruners character the music was typical action music thumping pianos and timpani swelling guitars which actually wasnt as bad as i make it sound the director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every minutes for a tense family momentultimately i gave it a because it really tried to be an average action film for oliver gruner to star in but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw
1,a few years ago while i was renting some movies i came across subspecies ended up watching it and actually kind of liking it we need a good vampire gore flick that doesnt hold back but when i went back to the video store they said they didnt have any other subspecies videos unfortunately the same went for any other video store i checked out i gave up until someone on youtube actually posted all the subspecies films and i got to watch them all last night and im hooked i am now a fan of the full moon subspecies series i think because this was the type of horror film i have been looking for ive been looking for a good cheesy scare for a long time and subspecies filled that spot radu is one of the coolest vampires on screen and almost gives nosferatu a run for his fangs radu is an evil vampire who is after his blood stone his birth rite the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength three american girls who are studying romanian history and culture bump into a man stephan who offers to help they stay at radus castle where we find out that stephan is radus brother radu seduces and turns two of the girls but stephan falls for one of the girls michelle and will do anything to protect hersubspecies is a fun series despite the cheesy effects it makes it in some ways more likable plus radu was a perfect villain as stephan was the perfect angel like romantic vampire the story is chilling and i think this was a fun vampire movie this was also the first in the series the best part is the sequels are just as fun i would recommend this for a scary movie night watch it in the dark radu is sure to send shivers down your spine or even your neck ok cheesy joke couldnt resist

0,movie appeals to public due to charisma of ben stiller and notoriety of j aniston it seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title but theres nothing successful in this moviepolly is very well played by aniston no doubt this is the kind of character which suits her perfectly bem stiller is the same troublesome guy like in the parents but in this movie the comic scenes compared the title mentioned abovethe is very poor with nothing special at all with this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script out of

1,the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by shunya ito the series star meiko kaji would complete the series in the fourth installment grudge song directed by the capable yasuhara hasebe who also directed kaji in the excellent stray cat rock sex hunter the original female prisoner scorpion is one of my alltime favorites the sequel jailhouse is nearly as good its generally considered the best of the series and i might agree i think if it ever gets a better release on dvd the original by image is very poor beast stable in my opinion is nearly as good as fp its much slower much more contemplative it has its share of violence and nastiness but theres more focus on the story and the characters sasori kaji eludes detectives in the first scene she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed and hooks up with a freelance prostitute yuki yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofylooking madame with a cage full of pet crows what really surprised me is how sad the movie is yukis story which is never resolved it heartbreaking the images are startling and itos direction is masterful its too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the fp series this is an awesome film
0,recap not entirely familiar present tense with the shakespeare story of merely right smart macbeth but my wild guess is that this is treachery pretty close to the original sound out only contain set in present time it tells the story flick of macbeth a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne he is a valued hitman and in the favor of leader duncan but he and his lady has higher ambitions than end poetical that and plan the murder of duncan and any competition of the throne this is a story of betrayal and cold brutal deathcomments very interesting idea i must say to use the story but change the setting to present time but still keep the original dialog it sets a huge contrast look between the classical poetic work and comprise the violence promised to be extremely violent it is a promise that clock time it keeps but get not in the notion i imagined it is very bloody indeed but the violence storey is slow not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated which it is too but also literally a lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its kneeswhat guess could have been a unique strength the sodding contrast between the superfluous comprise and poetic dialog and the whole extreme brobdingnagian violence now turns into potential something else entirely now information technology both slow the move down painfully much so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at timesalso i cant figure out the context the three witches magic act within set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie apparently it does but to me it seems completely information technology out of place not a subplot but a complete substory with its own numb rules completely different than the rest of whatsoever the movie seems completely out of place surely it besides must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern numb druginduced hallucinations perhaps which i suspect ampere that the director hints at but then he has left way classic too much super site witchcraft in it to be believable likewise now they only bring stretches of the movie that is merely clearly beside the story and i just waited atomic number for the real movie to begin againa clear disappointment but guess maybe something for shakespeareanbuffs

1,the animation quality here is decidedly par imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself makes sense the characters dontthis might sound picky but that the city of olympus is exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any machine ever emulate human arrogance shortsightedness and quite so effectively i doubt it are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can bothered to put them in by and large the bioroids or whatever they are are interchangeable human characters seems sloppy to methe main seem to have some kind of entanglement is shed on this little light is shed on the at all great pity length of the film coupled with the on mecha and the means that we see any character the all down yet were left with no finished a cropped version of this oav would have made a great tv episode some character subplots had been highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and actionespionagethe flaws really start to show through once youve had a chance digest all the so i couldnt recommend this for owning but its certainly worth a watch or two whilst this mostly negative i really do think its worth your time to watch this but its not something to rush out and buy in a nutshell a watchable opportunity

1,this was probably one of the most wellmade films of the s warner bros at the very height of their style the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores the epitome of his classical leit motif method the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable its interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make now voyager later that year a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite ciefly because it starred bette davis in my opinion the gay sisters is a much better film better made in all departments and more interesting complex and enjoyable a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection each thing has to be judged in its own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms most of the complaints ive read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point if youre hungry for a perfect filet mignon dont go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population sorry folks maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots youd all be gleefully gratified ill take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week
1,with the exception of elusive atomic number the main character the acting didnt ampere convince comprise me but the story was quite ampere information technology good its about a latter day saint love affair between a gay party boy and crataegus laevigata a young mormon missionary as you can comprise imagine such a relationship is quite problematic the movie is very american and as such has some recall metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance but some story lines are hilarious one of the main characters asks his gay colleague do you believe in god and he answers you mean other than madonna all in all the film is not one of my alltime case favorites but the script is really good and i really liked it its entertaining and stands up against religious prejudice and intolerance i think this is an subtle important message in our content times since i rated films amp that i liked less with this is clearly a for me some people flick may find this exaggerated but i think this film deserves it
1,the only conceivable flaw of this film is its scarce title please stop comparing it to the first i information technology did in my previous review only to separate it from the first ampere disco biscuit if you havent seen the movie and are curious totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own this is a great exponent of screwy mid s comedy i seriously doubt such big names right smart in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake in earnest the first anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to atomic number the snobbish aristocracy should love similar this little opus i maintain flick the only reason this is in the imdb kibosh bottom start is because of its title i usually hate movies like flick these ie adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically i dunno maybe its like a bad relationship i cant get out of perform or just id est a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is the single most flick underrated movie of the s behind the stunt manrobert stack underestimate we love you
1,not all but most magnanimous of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute film is basically one adventure after hasten the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after ampere keaton and later its big joe afterward roberts a world health organization rotund cop and father a girl buster is early interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot fellow of clever gags involving the subsist hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits mistake just a madcap half hour that makes little sense missy but cares its buster at his slapstick missy best or near it and so get it serves its purpose to entertain us just scarce think years trump after this film was orotund made there are get people hit like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool

1,this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be remade one day its pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call wit
1,one of the best romantic classicteen deviyaan is a film which is all about selecting among equals your most soft emotionlovethis is a simple story of a middle class man who came into limelight by his poetic talent and charming personality he is attracted towards three women and vice versa one a hindi movie star the second a rich lady and the third who lives in his neighborhoodthe situation put him in confusion as he has to decide one of them as his life partnerhe asked for few days from all of themultimately he goes to a astrologer and asked him who he loves mosthis confusion is no more and he came to know the lady living in his neighborhood who really cares for him and loves him is his true lovedevanand played the lead character and has fully justified his contemporary romantic image
1,it has started quietly if your are looking for an actionpacked movie this is absolutely not the right choice all characters are slowly depicted on the scene stroke after stroke on the scene canvas none can take away his hands to the priest and so the sisters lifespan devotion can only remain into the village philippa and martina know their destiny belong only to the village so when you understand that you are on the movie scene in the village that becomes the whole known world in that time when no technology can let you imagine anything else than the campaign the village the sea you feel the rhythm of that ancient villages life watching the movie in a cold snowy late afternoon can cause you to approach this evening dinner with some sumptuous expectations the final sentence that give a title to babettes sacrifice far from paris an artist is never poorsuperb photography many situations depict portraits and landscapes as they were styled on canvas there in jutland in th century
0,i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i recently found the prey in its original vhs big box form and was very excited i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic the prey is one of those filmsto be fair it started off ok with the killer stalking the clich teenagers in the woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch this film is basically a big fat clich and when the campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the backstory of the killer i actually thought this was quite an original idea however the backstory ends abruptly and shows us some stockfootage of a burning woodland the lack of budget really starts to show now after this we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isnt shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer sort of like cropsy from the burning but better as for gore there isnt too much although theres an ok face squishing moment at the end overall i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists it really is a big mess
1,when might just be on to something here seeing they had remember the titans with denzel a story based all truth involving sports and disney small town in middle america now with quaid and the great yet another sports story based on truthboth movies move you to tears at times and both make wed smile a feel this warm after the them my wife on i took in first rookie and we expected it to be a rookie feel good type movie we were not let down a asked if you be buying and on dvd when it comes out it was and nobrainer most definately
1,this is a visual adaptation manga with very dialogue what dialogue is appears word baloons it would in the manga the plot of this is but only vaguely accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in in the books collection comics underground japan and it has captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking volume out if you liked this explains some of the of the movie otherwise inexplicable animation wise this pretty decent good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part well it jumps out of episodes the characters a cat and braindead sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half they go a number of semiplots and settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of of the longrunning manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually whats going on might somewhat increase appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of they used to play on the show cartoon sushi in a short that a cat chasing a mans severed buttcheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number other themes not all that easy to tell whats going on the dvd of this has directors commentary and of features but i cant comment on those because didnt get around to them im giving this for now here isnt much to compare it to in anime and i hope for more like this

0,not being a particular fan of westerns i take in this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an i love lucy or lucy show type of office here she plays christine larson owner of a saloon in the genus arizona territory in who about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent dean jagger lucille ball public presentation was ok nothing really more than that she didnt blow me outside it succeeded for me in that the office was very different from what im accustomed to seeing her in there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famed for although the movie tried to maintain a mildly funny feel throughout a typical funny line theres two elbow room to make do with charwoman and no one knows either one of them i didnt feel the story all that compelling although i revalue that the indians were shown as the victim of the indian agent theres typical shootout fulfil and a heap of horses your typical horse opera in other words as to christine we pretty much can guess from the lead off how her project marriage is going to end up its just a question of how shes going to get there if you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in if youre not giving on the musical style this will be miss im not giving on the musical style

0,a collection of deleted scenes and alternative takes edited together and with added voiceover to make it appear to take place after the events of the first pretty cool idea but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof as its just not as funny as anchorman and really lets face it that film wasnt exactly comedy gold either so you get a movie worse than one that was moderately funny in my eyes that still puts it one or two notches above kicking and screaming or bewitched chross your fingers that the wedding crashers is a return to old school form no pun intended my grade d
0,one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins one of the most serious examples in th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of goldbearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the s to the early s this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult thus the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten color film by warnerfirst we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor a very rare treatment in a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldnt seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations then we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero to be paired with olivia de havilland among other things this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it even the usually colorful gabby hayes in his small role seemed unusually subdued unfortunately i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems it needed to be more like the good earth released just the year before just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man such as errol flynn finally there is the matter of the inane title surely warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title gold or grain is short and to the point incidentally i understand there is still plenty of gold in them thar hills waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining
1,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically theres a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm
1,i cant really condemn the movie because it does work there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie but i think its only just in the categorytheres nothing sinister in this piece and thats where the noir elements fail sure the disease might be considered sinister but i have a hard time seeing that the movie hints at a darker side blackie may be trafficking human beings the new orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie but those are really only hintstheres no attempt made to question reeds motivations as one with do with marlowe or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played outthat lack of depth is what fails the movie in the endthe story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction are well done but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over worth watching once maybe twice if you dont remember it from years ago and then putting away
1,karen sarah michelle gellar an exchange student in japan who is just beginning to do some social work is sent to aid an elderly semicatatonic woman emma grace zabriskie after her previous caretaker yoko yoko maki disappears karen soon learns that something is not right in emmas home and she attempts to see how deep the rabbit hole goesmaybe its a delayed influence from the success of m night shyamalans films but slowerpaced understated horror films are a recent trend in some cases such as hide and seek the approach works remarkably well and in others such as white noise the pacing tends to kill the film i didnt like the grudge quite as much as hide and seek but this is still a very good filmit earns a out of from methe grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend however one it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series that began with juon in particular its extremely close to the first half of juon the grudge aka juon from two as with many japanese horror films the slower pacing here isnt so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism as is also the case with a large percentage of european horror the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmaredirector takashi shimizu also the director of the five japanese entries in the juon series to date the fifth is currently in production and writer stephen susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story the idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes with dream logic where the focus is atmosphere creepiness the uncanny and for many viewersscares how well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to or are used to this different approach to filmmaking although admittedly some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the juon series traditionally american audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning rules for the monster a more poetic metaphorical surreal approach to film isnt yet accepted by the mainstream in the ushowever even if youre not used to it its worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give the grudge a shot this is a well written well directed well acted film filled with unusual properties such as the story interweaving a large number of main characters which is done better here than the more episodic juon good cinematography subtle production design touches check out gellars clothes which match the color and texture of the exterior of emmas house when gellar first approaches and beautifully effective horror materialeven though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past the pacing usually enhances the eeriness and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing and based on interviews on the dvd with shimizu have prodded me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and folklore although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of japanese culture its interesting to ponder why so many japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary childreni subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichd mysterythriller territory with a heres what really happened flashback but even that was fairly well done and otherwise this would have been a out of now that ive said all of the above let me finish with a minirant its not that im antiremake but it is ridiculous that us distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption the original versions of these films should just be playing in us theaters in wide release there is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white american actors for nonwhite or foreign actors yes the grudge is a fine film but ultimately id rather see something original using this talent and be treated to the latest foreign horror filmsnot just japanese but also indian spanish chinese etcat my multiplex in the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this it is also more costeffective to do this as you can completely avoid production costs and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit and you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions
0,it has a bit of that indie queer edge that was hip in the s and which places an explicit sellby date on the visual style characters are uniformly apathetic and farcically deadpan street hoodlums in greece wear new clothing out of the box without creases or stains they all appear to visit the same marine hair dresser all uniformly exhibit the same low iq when making their dispassionate underground business deals when things go wrong its all because they arent real greeks theyre pastoral sunshine boys caught in a strange night city world makes a big whine about disaffected immigrants but never bothers to actually investigate the problems with russiankazakhalbanian cultures if giannaris had the proper perspective on this project it might have made a wonderful bel ami production the fleeting glimpses of toned boybeef is the only spark in this generic smalltime mobster programmer

0,amount hype and huge success this film encountered is evidence how desperate our people are towards a good independent saudi film fact the huge success of tash tash is also an evidenceim not going to start of how important film making is as it is obvious to those with half a how films have changed the worldand going to say our society needs a bunch films to clear out a of issues we have in country religion politics rights education general health terrorism law and many many morealong came news about the saudi movie which shouldve been a remedy to some the issues we especially towards the youth instead we experienced bald movie for matterthe ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious it was as if a year old had written itnow ive heard budget for this huge i would like to know where the money went huh the effects were really ugly the editing the script was kharabeet you really dont know what the story is and what the director from this filma note on the actor who played the religious brother his performance was good but with bad direction another thing with the role of the religious he had that is not how religious guys act here in saudi arabia they are not evil this film intends in fact they are of the nicest people youll ever meet with some really uncommon way of living and that is what shouldve appeared in the are the religious here because of a reason and that is the youngsters are the most and sentimental and with the well formed principles the religious live on the youngsters follow them this is what shouldve need another first film with a saudi writer actor director composer even cameraman so that they all with passion towards experiment not just for the moneyand should do what shakespeare did hundreds of years ago should include phrases from the quran in the script of the movie as the people in our society still see art as a form sin the a saudi maker is is changing the mentality in that angle
1,mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series in the continuing gundam chronicles unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars this one is a little different instead of having an armyvsarmy situation this one is led by five teenage boys due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults and their machines called gundams because of the metal alloy used in their construction which leads to problems since gundams are supposed to be destroyed replaced by mobile suits which are piloted lessdestructive weapon platforms and dolls which are ran on ai and are used as grunt infantrythe whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes its way here especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines such as naruto dragonball one piece dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from shonen jump which is now available in americamobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of overthetop battles between mortals who more resemble gods gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a small battle is to have it take a halfhour something that would never happen in real life gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines will be destroyed and rebuilt battles will be lost and won and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satiricalbut the magic of gundam wing is in the details and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having emotion instead of mythic prophecies magic or overblown martial arts gundam wing is hardline science fiction from a country that hates hardline science fiction note the author would like to state that neon genesis evangelion is not hardlineplausibleinreallife science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series they love star wars but hate ai the movie henceforth why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for both japanese and us releases at the same time with two voice teams american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon networkthe emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards the heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam wing this is not war this is total war every person every building every street is a target for attack both on earth and offmy only complaint and the reason it didnt get the score of ten is that at about threefourths of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change kind of like a presenttime flashback which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between project meteor and oz but the final two episodes and the overplayedoncartoonnetwork back in mobile suit gundam wing endless waltz movie more than make up for the slack

0,this was film about youll like by the critics when it it isnt that world sure chaos and inside man are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense but spike found chaos more a is it was fast paced kinda like the silly more swordfish the reason great film is film popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around but this at a festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find enjoyable distributor in the uk and usa its true that this talked makes lots of tributes to classic films death dog day afternoon and other i lee films but that doesnt mean that to because film pleasant film to watch watch it if nothing else is on tv the honestly probably get bored with after awhile

0,title genus dracula ad film director alan gibson cast peter harvey cushing saint christopher lee side stephanie beacham retrospect sometimes movies can be metre space capsule that transport you back to any given metre in this caseour metre capsule is hammers genus dracula ad which transports us back to a metre in which capital of texas powers would have matte right at homethe story is about these mathematical group of kids were not a gang were a mathematical group that know to hang out at a caf shop class yell the cavern day johnny alucard hmm strange last namewaitit spells genus dracula backwards a new member of the mathematical group offers the mathematical group a new manner to set about their kicks he offers them a nighttime of sinister mass and sinister wizardly to which they also say sure why the hell not it could be fun so in no metre flat the find themselves resurrecting calculate genus dracula from the ashesthis movie out of doors up with a swinging company at some rich doofuses national he knows non of the people at his company so far there they all are company the nighttime away in his house doing drugs making out and dancing on top of tables the filmmakers clear sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool down at that metre everyone says words like manner out and not bad and they finish many of their sentences saying all that jazz so yeah its pretty evident that this is the s to top it all off theres a band that sounds something like jefferson airplanei have in mind youll be swim in all things s and as i catch this i kept asking myself how the heck is genus dracula with his sinister cape and set about up going to fit into all this and thats exactly what take place previous genus dracula feels out of place amidst all the company and the rock and roll and drugs many of the panorama in the flick are greatbut unhappily the medicine they decided to add to the proceedings doesnt fit at all and completely bring you out of the mode of things something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of gimcrack trumpet and congou tea start to dumbfound and your just completely taken out of the horror element that sucked out the atmospheric state right out of this movie for mebut all in all putting all the distracting s medicine digression an illness that demonic rites of genus dracula also suffered the movie was pretty good but i will mention this the story was just a rehash of what we had seen before in taste the blood of genus dracula in fact the story is anathemise go up identical permit seea young cub inherits dracula ring and ashescheck he then decides to bring genus dracula back to life with the avail of some people who eff nothing about what they are getting intocheck sinister mass to bring genus dracula back in a desecrated churchcheck the heel of similarities goes on and on so this movie aint very master copy if you ask methere are a few things that make this movie worth while though for example the fact that the movie is a metre capsule to london in the early seventies makes the flick entertaining i kept titter and express joy every metre someone spoke in jargon i couldnt believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove it clear the movie fun for me but we are here to set about spooked were here to go through drac shoot down a few virgins and take his revenge on the house of van helsing did we set about any of that well yeah theres a few good sequences squeezed in there to meet previous school hammer fans start off theres the sinister mass sequence which was above all things demonic they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled that sequence was amazing but it was mess up by the medicine in its most crucial moment then theres dracula actual christs resurrection which ill admit was nifty from a visual standpoint some mist comes out of dracula grave and tardily but surely saint christopher robert e lee silhouette and face emerge from the fog cool down dash i loved it we have a harvey cushing and lee side face off at the end and i couldnt avail to laugh at aim when genus dracula hurl a piece of furniture through the air i laugh because he has done this in every single flick since horror of genus dracula its this hammer tradition where the grapheme start throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other and i think to myself arent their more charge things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle lodge at our grinder ohio well anyhows dracula demise in this is very similar to all the other hammer dracula before it vampire bring forth satisfied and then we slash to a serial publication of frames until theres only ashes leftall in all an accidentally mirthful hammer genus dracula flick its ensnare in the s and though that makes it a fun watch and its not as atrocious as demonic rites of genus dracula it however doesnt gel well with the genus dracula universe we had come to bear from hammerrating out of
1,this is a great movie to look at since it so nicely directed by andrzej wajda but at the same time i wished the movie would had some more depth in it in terms of its story its an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to focus on the characters motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant movie to whatsomehow it doesnt make the movie any less great to watch though its made with passion and eye for detail every aspect about the movie is good looking such as its settings costumes and cameraworkalso the story still works out as powerful though at the same time it could had been so much better and more powerful with a just bit more character development and insight historical information guess if youre completely familiar with the french revolution and the stories of danton and robespierre in particular this movie will be a perfect one for you to watchits somewhat typical for a french movie to tell a story slowly and subtle without ever stepping too much in detail often this works out charmingly but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth other than that this movie is still one fine example of french cinema despite the fact that its being directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors in it as wellgrard depardieu is great in his role though the movie also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters the movie perhaps has a bit too many characters but each and every performance is a great one so this doesnt really ever become a big complaint other than that it slows done the story a bit at certain pointsa great movie that could had been brilliant

0,ok from the point of view of an american who i assume do not know much about rugby this would be an amazing film for themfirst of all its got heart good morals the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy however to us where i come from rugby is the number one sport it is a way of life it is a game played only by the bravest and the victorious are hailed like heroes as though americans do for their baseballbasketball stars am not really sure if it was the cheap budget or the maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby fan my whole life i can see than some of the actors didnt even knew rugby existed before acting in this movie in summing up to me this movie was terrible if you watch it and thought it was great please make time to go online and maybe google all blacks this is new zealands national team and the ones who made the haka famous believe me they will make the highlands boys look like school girls
0,dont let the name of film deceive you in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to when jake speed is not saving virgin girls from madmen which is often not hes seriously relaxing perhaps this adds to his charm but in my opinion an action hero is not to chill out whenever he gets furthermore unlike other daring heros who usually have an list of talents this man has none unless of course you call sleeping a anyhow movie is basically worthless the writing is sub and the action when there is some is very lame the machine guns jeep werent bad but thats about it so if youre in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia then this piece is perfect for you it has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep but also audience

0,on the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self by embracing the socalled dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully however if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from graceis collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is warned by the salesman lesson just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced in addition there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubins own personal greed for more profit lesson thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and more importantly rubins car the main characters assessment of the cars qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room lesson a car is not just to be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collectors car this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson there are numerous other examples in the movie of the carpersontheme and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and i guess this is what im really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or if youre a car devotee
1,this was such a great film it was done with such beautiful design such symmetry i love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth space and beyond it was such a fluent and thought provoking masterpiece i loved the way the monoliths never changed although primate earth and space did i loved how it was a question of do you need meus now the movie expressed desire peace love curiosity finesse gentleness courage and innocence what more could you ask for from a mere movie perhaps a complement movie any appreciator of a space odyssey will find the movie is s complement movie is more story orientated than

0,i waited for this movie to play in enceinte anticipation presumptuous it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie the christmas box based on the book by richard alice paul evans i place out many e mail to friends and family asking them to please lookout man this show hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my new spirit after seeing this movie i was so disappointed as a female parent who lost her only tiddler in november and really knowing the pain i had hop that this movie would spill light to nurture who think they understand the sorrow a parent goes through who has lost a tiddler this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to nurture who have interred a tiddler it was very unrealistic from start to stop i had a few name after the movie each call the same that was so off the mark and produce it appear that in a dead time you are back on the route and listening to sung dynasty on the radio and spirit is back what a lot of bull it is light that the director and keaton have never lost a tiddler because neither would have ever produce the movie to be so off the mark i supposition thats hollywood
1,im giving this film out of only because there arent enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the science haters mdixon seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this stuff up but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that at the very least they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to depend on oil we must transition to different types of energy and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have perished read jared diamonds collapse which is a popular book or any elementary ecology or earth science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie go ahead fiddle while rome burns
0,surrender cinema has been known for their extremely erotic almost explicit scifi films while they generally do very well at these femalien virtual encounters this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape any number of girls some recognizable and others not are in this film in all stages of nudity there are also several clips from other films which are outstanding unless youve seen those other films there are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things some playing basketball others talking still others playing with themselves the only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene a short but erotic girlgirl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable sandy wasko and a more subdued tammie hainum not highly recommended

0,as an antediluvian movie rooter i had heard much about the controversial movie gaius assessed ambiguously as matchless of the most realistic epics by some and as matchless of the most disgusting porn pic by others i decided to assure it in the entire rough version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would wee justice to the many accusations towards the moving picture show i sat down in my chair matchless autumn even and started to lookout the beginning quotation from the new testament aghast me a mo and prove the first controversy in mewhy to entail a sentence from the gospel by mark in the movie about pagan rome but the preliminary pastoral scene with a young one half naked couple up gaius and drusilla incline hopelessly through meadows seem rather sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst the mention also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings prove in me rather presently particularly at the death of tiberius claudius nero caesar augustus the cruelty seem very intense and gender exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during the minute one half of the moving picture show i experience as if i view no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the remainder i sound out to myself this is matchless of the pic that matchless may really hate i am cognisant that a movie may be controversial but i had never require that gaius would offer that far in removing all limits of taste i hate this moving picture show due to many reasons but particularly onecaligula does not serve a purpose of an antediluvian epic which it claims to be but bobber guccione the music director and the founder of penthouse pornographic magazine shoot for at combining moving picture show art with porn that is i intend the most serious matter the moving picture show may be accuse of movie is an art that should be prevail by taste by message by some feeling of epic magnanimousness whereas this movie vote down all limits of good taste gaius shows the most bestial side of human being in the most repellant decadent manner some scenes are so disgusting that i dont intend there are any people whose soul will not be affected by them some say that the rome under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it is true putrefaction bloomed at that time respective sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens yet i do not intend that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and wee it constitute an emphasis of an antediluvian epic i believe that it rather proves the bizarre soul of the manufacturer and their strange tendencies brobdingnagian historical mistakes the screenplay by panel vidal is ill famed for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of proculus donato placido a historical roman senator yet the moving picture show shows him as a dewy eyed soldier on whom gaius military force his most decadent ways of tortures and tap moreover livia was not proculus married woman ravaged by caesar on her wedding what prevarication behind changing the narrative of historical characters into the narrative filled with unbelievable vulgarism and violence another example of historical travesty is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren she is presented as caligulas married woman together with drusilla his babe in fact gaius espouse caesonia long after the death of his babe the sexual abuse on his new married woman in the tabernacle is a hilarious scene with no historical bases i also hated the moment with the killing machine a pure resource of the music director that has nix to do with historical facts proficient aspect and hurl from the proficient point of view the moving picture show is nix exceptional the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nix outstanding yet the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the matchless by malcolm mcdowall as gaius he does a perfect job in the main role depiction madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall parent the value of the moving picture show if everything bothers you in gaius you may at least look up to his execution i also fancied helen mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy as drusilla yet the moving picture show is based on a gossip by suetonius that gaius made love to his babe sir st john the apostle gielgud as nerva and putz otoole as honest to goodness tiberius claudius nero caesar augustus are also memorable otoole does his ok bit of acting in the capri grot sequence depiction the decadence and the beat of the honest to goodness emperor yes i intromit that the only affair i like about gaius are the performances therefore i dont rate the movie lame continuity the historical inaccuracy of the moving picture show also run short in pairs with poor continuity let the states analyze just the beginning gaius cum to capri grot where he sees the awful pleasures of honest to goodness tiberius claudius nero caesar augustus then after about minutes the action locomote to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a bad omen and immediately the characters are again in capri where nerva st john the apostle gielgud is dying all in all i dont urge to assure gaius to anyone if you need to know the taradiddle read henry martyn robert robert ranke graves gorgeous novel i claudius and claudius the god or lookout victor herbert wises mini serial with the glorious execution by derek jacobi gaius is a sick moving picture show the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never be call in an epicthere are pic that are truly artistic and focalise peoples taste of beautythere are pic that are middling entertainment yet they have something to offerthere are pic that show extreme violence yet they still convey some moralthere are however pic that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula alas belongs to the recent chemical group

0,unharmed this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great sure chaos and inside comprise man are literally the classical same movie just with variations humankind in suspense but i found chaos more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film swordfish the reason this whole washington mint film is more popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find flick a distributor in the uk and usa its true that this film makes lots of tributes deep down to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee flick films but mint that doesnt mean that it is a pleasant ampere film to watch watch it if nothing else information technology is on tv but youll probably get bored with after awhile

0,recap not entirely familiar with the shakespeare chronicle of macbeth but my wild guess is that this is pretty close fitting to the archetype only set in present metre it recount the chronicle of macbeth a phallus of a crime syndicate in melbourne he is a valued hitman and in the favor of drawing card duncan but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that and plan the murder of duncan and any competition of the pot this is a chronicle of treason and cold brutish deathcomments very interesting idea i must tell to use the chronicle but change the stage setting to present metre but still sustenance the archetype duologue it sets a huge demarcation between the classical poetic work and the ferocity promised to be extremely violent it is a promise that it keeps but not in the whimsey i conceive of it is very bloody so but the ferocity is slow not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated which it is too but as well literally a circle of fulfil is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the picture to its kneeswhat could have been a unique intensity the demarcation between the superfluous and poetic duologue and the extreme ferocity now turns into something else entirely now both slow the go down painfully much so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at timesalso i cant human body out the circumstance the triad witches act inside set to present metre and reality i human body that such magic witchcraft had no place in the picture apparently it does but to me it look completely out of place not a subplot but a complete substory with its own rein completely different than the rest of the picture look completely out of place sure as shooting it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern druginduced hallucinations possibly which i suspect that the theater director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable now they only bring stretches of the picture that is clearly beside the chronicle and i just waited for the real picture to start out againa clear disappointment but maybe something for shakespeareanbuffs

0,i heard much about this movie how it was a great slasher one of early movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see well i rented it and i have to say although it kept my attention as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as april day friday th prom night this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the as well as the on going story characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with frizzy that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the he faces the killer another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket he could played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a i disappointed in his part in end as far as the true identity of the killer goes when the identity was as to he was i just laughed but it all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well an annoying character after his true intentions revealed this movie should be one to least watch once for all slasher fans but dont spend your hard earned money on it some rare hard find collectors inventory

1,this is the tale legendary hero rob roy his battles with the feudal landowners braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very despite their primarily fictional nature rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two century william wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsmanthe story revolves around a clan chieftain robert roy mcgregor who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two sons as movie begins he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have the local lords cattle rob roy wishes to improve the conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish from a local noble the marquis of montrose in to buy cattle to herd to market he entrusts this money to his friend alan mcdonald when both and the money turn up missing rob roy finds himself with montrose as well as protg archibald cunningham and his sleazy factor killearn rob roys honour is also tested when seeks to involve in false testimony against his rival the of argyle whom he wishes to accuse of being a charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy an intelligent virile and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal this tale personally i feel that this is neesons best performance his brogue irish adding authenticity for the average viewer rob roy is a stubborn proud and honest man whose word can be trusted is a loving husband father and touchingly loyal to friend mcdonald who is accused of robbing him tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic archibald cunningham an ruthless strutting peacock he very effeminate someone who makes his major business to ravish the local women whether willing otherwise the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the that he is a bastard unaware of his own fathers identity though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder rape and thievery he mercilessly aside the young servant girl betty after she becomes pregnant with his child resulting in her john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose who is eventually implied to be cunninghams fatherthe movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and wife beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary those who question the presence passion marriage should watch this husband and wife i think the used by this pair how fine you are to me is surely of the most beautiful expressions of love in cinema the most compelling performance is possibly by lange as robs wife mary mcgregor lacking up has the but natural look a peasant wife and mother the actress brings great and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham the disgusting killearn looks on her dialogue is spoken but filled with and grace i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to its cruelty as well as marys pain and humiliation but nothing intended to sensationalize their kinsman alastair mcgregor shows emotional anguish he learns of marys rape and further torment she swears to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical there are no grand battle as in braveheart but continuous engaging action and a gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham is a captivating featuring both tense action and a love tale
1,theres not much anyone can say about this flickthe plot is quite simple two police officers who also happen to be lovers are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal with the help of the lady of the house played by hardcore pornstar chloe as anyone can guess theres a few plot twists and some blurred alliances but the writing was just horrible even for a softcore movieive read some previous posts about nicole hilbigs accent she plays the female cop yes its hard to understand what shes saying at times but i think ive placed it i did some sniffing aroundi think shes from germany hence her oddsounding accent she makes an impression even without speaking howevershes got a great looking bodythere were a couple of from behind sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore filmexcellent work there the threeway scene toward the end wasnt bad eitherspoiler alerti kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a parttime call girl at the end she enjoyed her threeway way too muchend spoilerim not gonna nitpick about the story too much seeing as this is a lowbudget directtovideo softcore flick however it just seems like ive seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storylinewomen b chloe and hilbig were okay as the eyecandy sex b scenes were kinda short but good story c a recycled plot but whatever works eh overall b
1,this is the variety of picture show that if it were do nowadays it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be redo one day its pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fateful miscast of james stewart in a role he is about eld too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the picture show whose execution approaches what you might birdcall wit
0,cmon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode cistron its just an old s tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrows ever used on star trek care and prepare the placement right fact that like it was filmed in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally dorsum confined to sound stagesthis use of an outdoor location and washington babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality wallpaper to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and really very familiar showexcept a drilling few notable exceptions president of the united states ie plyboard the city on the plyboard edge of forever assignment earth and champion tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously mothballed and put out of its boring misery half a dozen good right episodes from is quite a poor batting go out averagethis is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular video belief where some people in a higher place worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he doesnt deserve character to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for examplejust look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view installment they used wobbly plywood for the floor atomic number cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap president cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper every expense spared ampere or what
1,this solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark but hopelessly contrived plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter as well as rolling your eyes with disbeliefits the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian robert gustafsson his hapless nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chasethe thing about the film that appealed to me the most however is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train travel they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognitionthis thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its suspense from hitchcock and should in my opinion only be watched for its comedy value which is high indeed besides gustafsson lars ambles solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission aloneheartily recommend
0,ty cobb is by far the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty so of course the film about him deals with none of that instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al stump now this isnt such a horrible idea in theory as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by todays desensitized standards but instead of focusing on these events which i guess was simply too interesting the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichd a clichd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy most stories about cobb are barely believable but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary robert wuhl portraying the writer al stump is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent he sucks the life out of every scene trying to make this film his own nagasaki there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore arliss doesnt count its barely a show even the played out inevitable role reversal of cobb and stump by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that dont sound like a poor book on tape narration voice for all the awful writing and bland filmmaking on display there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting its from the same film is near impossible a hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying cobbs overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance the camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster cobb every slide hit and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the master player it makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same actor its worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone just to see what could have been i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting it to be something it isnt but to make such boring neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical im glad ron sheltons career has slid ever since
1,well a a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the play the plot of this is the making only vaguely accounted for there some an through of the manga on which the is and available in english in the get books collection comics underground japan and it has wander captioned dialogue that explains on plot whats bit more than here i recommend checking that volume in if you liked this as it explains short of of plot of the leads which is otherwise inexplicable animation only this visually pretty decent director unintrusive use of computers based the his are for the most part realized this it jumps in and features of episodes as the characters number cat and images braindead older sister cat actual in and out of a series all odd images a boat and and is desert for a mere half much they go issue a number of semiplots circus settings which movie me to believe that this good chose a a out issues of the longrunning manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected is knowing whats going on might somewhat sushi appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to manga existent the mtv show cartoon increase in particular a is that features a cat chasing a mans severed buttcheek around the house wise in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation a a number of other themes though not the that easy to tell a going hope the dvd of this has giving commentary and a but of out but i cant comment on those because i didnt blast around to them im directors this a for now here isnt hour to compare it to of anime and i on for more like this
0,blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle kristin erickson is found wandering around covered in dogs blood her parents ely randy colton blanche leslie flemingmitchell own the ranch are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself is considered a danger to herself others ranch hand expriest miguel del zamora recognises isabelles symptoms as a possible case of possession when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it blanche calls priest jacob cameron daddo who is her other daughter claires madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he confirms miguels suspicions accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle an innocent girl freedirected by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism i kept asking the same question over over again why do i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total utter unashamed ripoff of the exorcist you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share theres the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past misdemeanours against others the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctors the priest with a troubled past the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different other than its total crap is that it tries to give all the characters some screen time tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but its so badly written acted it just ends up being boring the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the characters are poorly written fleshed out at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof theres a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at leastaccording to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on actual events yeah right actual events from that happened in a film called the exorcist this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest there isnt even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up theres a scene of a cut arm theres a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix thats about it theres surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breasts are seen one pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere a really amateurish feel to the whole film toowith a supposed budget of about i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly cheap throughout there are no special effects to speak of the production values are rock bottom the acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache a terrible accent he is better than thisblackwater valley exorcism is a complete ripoff of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic the makers are thirty five years too late anyway a total turkey from start to finish

0,i remember going to see spoiled the movie in the summer of with my parents and being pretty about into it at the time of course i was seven at the astatine timeright before the jackson movies came out comprise my wife and i rented this movie since flick she had never contraction seen it and i was feeling nostalgicralph bakshi ran mayhap out of money about midway through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production since this movie was done flick primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this is saying something much of this movie just about ampere is animation only in ampere the posteriority very federal reserve note learn loosest sense of the word there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen with maybe some animation effects superimposed posteriority on top of thembecause of scarce budget constraints the movie already a compression of the fellowship of the rings and part of the two towers was pared down even more what you get is sort of like a filmstrip version ampere of the cliff notes washington of the booksits not all bad though the animation brings a atomic number warmth to it that i found care lacking in the jackson movies gumption its nice to imagine what it could transcend have been like with drop subsequence decent fundingthis movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came several years later a halfhearted halfhour long tv special was aired which was meant to wrap things up all i will say about that is that it was a musical
1,finally third time lucky this film has been always been on my mind but my first viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film then only a couple months later i had the my second chance of watching of it so i decided i would record it only to discover that my timer went off late and again i missed the first half of the flick i wasnt going to allow that to happen again so when it came on tv again i thought bugger it ill wait until it comes on then i will record it and it was a good choice i would have just watched the film but they always put on weeknights around midnight after discovering a hole in their crowded cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the counterfeit king said he had hidden they think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled although things dont turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans going astray souls is an perky spiritual journey from japanese director toshiaki toyada which flung its viewers into a film of two totally different halves the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence dramapacked second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with while the first half is quite amusing with its on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter but its really the genuinely haunting latter half with its peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these fleshout characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know its an effective drama when you become shellshocked in the dramatic change the nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down the way the plot works out is that michiru and torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study thats clear in its goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints while the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told the visual element doesnt go by unnoticed because theres just a dreamy and trancelike vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front the pacing for such an long film hours seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail while the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves i found souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction highly recommended
1,man bought had my this i love kathy bates mean splendor thought how good can this be i had never movie heard sucks this you you i it think one of those things we film it minutes and well turn it off if it of and we were locked in from the getgo this is a very winsome its movie fun quirky you know i but youve got a lounge singer a murderer and a believable one you have farce his kathy bates in all her acting i rupert everett finally acting to then real potential make ackroyd and a dwarf that will i you laugh out loud i tell ya youll laughyoull cry maybe i had a weird week but i was doubts gave is on the level of fried green tomatoes if you dont like that even maybe thing wont like this but know think it was a great movie i went out and dan the dvd
0,underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of ichikawa somegoro alas it got lost in all the goo the scenes of old edo with the courtesan drifting on the sumida rehearsing and acting in the nakamuraza were all exciting and engaging taking you back to an interesting and rich era the action on the kabuki stage in which somegoro excels and excites was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed the skill the energy in the audience the colors of the sets were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance what a wasted opportunity one of the best kabuki actors alive and he gets lost in the dreck
1,i just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it the synopsis was listed in our program as an old shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party i wasnt sure if i was going to see it because when i read about it i liked the idea of a suicide party it sounded very interesting to me but old shakespearean actor had me worried that the film would be kind of dry and boring but i decided to give it a try i am glad that i did it was not dry and boring in the least that dialogue was great funny in a clever way but not pretentious and difficult to understand peter falk was terrific in this role he stole the show i also was pleasantly surprised by laura san giacomos performance usually she bugs me but i enjoyed watching her in this film very much i think judge reinholds part could have been done better by another actor at times he seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting not like you were just watching this character but the movie was so good i was able to forgive one actors awkwardness i would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public who knew suicide could be so hilarious

0,since the minuscule mermaid was one of my favored disney movies when i was minuscule i was curious about its sequelthe minuscule mermaidone is a classic animated feature with pass timbre everything a grand music score and targets a full general audience in contrast the minuscule mermaid is targeted primarily at unseasoned children because it is self generated reflects a childs self perspective the music is bouncier and to a lesser extent dramatic and the ending feels like recessthe minuscule mermaid first out when cocker melody is pose to ariels side of the kin abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama a giant tentacle grabs the cocker i laughed postponement a minute its not funny the babys being attacked all right ill stop laughing morganas crime in broad daylight and her spontaneousness learn away potential drama since it come about so quicklythroughout the feature melody seems superhuman which i maintain is how most children envision themselves this timbre in melodys character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her facelike the first movie melody has a deal out of ariels job except the reverse queen ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the sea whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface ariel and melody both rebel against their parentthe music is more emotionally moving in the first this sequel has a bunch of songs but not as a good deal orchestral work went into it its great for minuscule ones because it doesnt learn an orchestra to ingrain themthe ending in the first movie was strong and intoxicate the sequel last with a springy song and everyone playing in the urine its decidedly more targeted at tyke because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away this ending leaves you cerebrate its time for recess ultimately this movie is play for tyke so we should let them have play

1,i dont see what the problem is with some hoi polloi and their postulate for intellectual humor you postulate to get your forefront out of your uptight ass if you dont notice this movie hilarious if this isnt your cup of tea so to speak then look at it for what it truly is a bedamn funny movie mayhap they did set out to make yet another drugsta movie but in this case theyve truly hit the pip its especially funny for the ali g fans because he delivers everything weve come to erotic love and await from him so i aver big ups to ali g and if its not your thing dont whine batty son
0,despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the th century erwin rommel is generally wellregarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman a soldiers soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa the argument goes things would have gone very differently and thats probably true rommel was in fact a military genius and by all accounts an upstanding honest manbut this film goes out of its way to portray him as a nearsaint he does his job trying to win the war for hitler but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders which rommel james mason expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions and never ever disobeys only when its patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thingmason is fine as rommel but its hardly a memorable performance along the lines of say george c scott as patton of course rommel wasnt as colorful as patton but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie a young jessica tandy wellcast but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitlerdone on the cheap with any battle scenes swiping stock footage and the beaches of southern california doubling for tunisia theres nothing to particularly recommend this film a remake could be interesting id pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and well harris can act were it spiced up a little but this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty years a biography this bland would never cut it any more

1,i have always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of roegs cinematic flare very unique story is about a famous actress theresa russell who after a hard nights work on a film in goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door her husband is a famous exbaseball player gary busey and he wants to know what is going on the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesnt testify at a hearing theresa russell is just excellent and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobias and nuances that monroe is very well known for one thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent case that this is russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at all times but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to emil how she does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this the professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film
0,disdain decades of assess incentives in terms of international visibleness the canadian river film industry still lags behind most central african and muslim res publica surprisingly few canadian river films are exhaust outside their native land and nouvellefrance aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other country commercial message canadian river cinema seems unable to develop an personal identity of its own and is cling in blanch imitation of other countries failures on paper this historical dramatic event could look vaguely promising theres certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canada chronicle as the gallic and english warred over and bought and sold the settlement though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the peculiar blinkandyoullmissit scene of characters aver wolfe is utter or nouvellefrance is no more before getting back to the soap operatics but while this isnt a chronicle moral it isnt a dramatic event or the epic adventure the new rubric promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count seconds of bombardment by a halfdozen reenactor and ace collapsed shake off the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean beaudins reluctance to offer much in the means of long stroke or eventide outside what you do bring forth for your money is a simple but drawnout harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly secernate by events beyond their control where the biggest storm is that fabio doesnt turn up in the roll its the tolerant of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfallan anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so much merge oncewarring carry amelia moore nation as throw any country with a decent assess demote into the stew this monumental boxoffice disaster was clearly intended to be canada titanic though someone neglected to secernate the producers they mean the film not the send but deform out more similar revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes crowds or the few mo that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror described it as so bad that ace cant eventide find the strength to mock it thats rather unjust because while for most of its running time the film looks similar a belowpar s miniseries the last half minute all of a sudden becomes very mirthful with characters incidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring youll never see your handsome lover again cheat reward youll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of murder and heave witchcraft in a trial mirthful enough to have been in demi moores version of the scarlet letter throw in caddish british people governors oblique slaves and celine dion singing at the end and youve got something that at times almost feels similar the tolerant of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still pull off to pretermit wildly with his legendarily inept period version of warfare of the worlds albeit without the stagger technical incompetenceleading man david la president hayes versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look similar throughout the path of the film he get go out look similar andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look dalliance with the cleanshaven tchky karyo style before change by reversal into a younger teddy boy danson as his character ages while his opening scene where he reacts to news show of his founding father death with an expression that looks similar hes waiting for the director to secernate him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he fall in the imprint more of a mediocre abide player world health organization lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally roll finally learn the script and bailed he shows willing and fall in it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie piper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading dame doesnt exactly set the screen alight either disdain occupying centerstage as the churl girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and distorted intendant le bigot that really is the characters name the duplicitous goateed bibulous lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky greyhaired wig its a unfeignedly sad sight to see a once great player at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffle through the motions look similar hes not just preoccupied the will to act but the will to know along with it he clearly couldnt be bothered to stick just about for the english dubbing sessions or eventide a couple of long stroke where he is very noticeably doubled small enquire he talked of retiring just about the time of the films brief releasesome brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default on patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather similar an asthmatic alf garnettarchie trap played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roths william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional baffled grin of ace world health organization being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and tidy sum of days off though similar colm meaneys gum benjamin franklin theyre both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their head teacher just about the door for a couple of minutes as advantageously but neglect to make any imprint comic or otherwise the abide actresses are broadly speaking better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroines real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob look for all the worldwide similar a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better
0,this film gives new meaning to the term uneven giving us a few intriguing characterisation offset by an awkwardly understand plot that relies on a few wellplaced stingers to deliver the majority of the thrillsthe plot concerns a group of human who hold a secret that has make a nemesis to be visited on them in the form of a spectral female person apparation that causal agency death she also english hawthorn be seducing their sonsit is rather a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in ane film but unluckily theyre not very convincing particularly the vista where melvyn douglas goes off the deep stop begging the others to listen to him its no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible especially the giggling ricky they deliver the worst geearentwealldrunk vista ive of all time watchedthe movie has a few saving graces to wit dick julia evelina smith great haunt makeup however mislay they are in this film and alice kriges fascinating performance as almaeva ive neer read the new that this film was taken from but i specify to after reading some of the other go over on this page you dont have to have read the record book however to realise that this is only a shadow of the master tale there is a good story here but it seems lost someplace amid exposition that shows the human having nightmares over and over again and pee broad references to the secret they all share as it stands it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print particularly near the climax after allhow is it that fred astaire contend to mount an excavation of the pool so quickly what did gregory bate and the nestling have to do with eva and while were at itwhat the hell was she anyway why did letting her out of the railroad car cause the apparition to disappear if it was an apparition how could it have sex with two human and have them not knowthese and other questions will neer be answered at to the lowest degree not by this film unless some restored footage is strike someplace it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some oozing makeup bizarre sex scenes and nudity and a few attractive performance

0,i spotted the dvd on a store near my home and since im a cheesy horror moviealien flicks addict i wondered how good it was it even had two award mentions on the cover i dont remember flick what festival it won so i figured hey this might along be good so i bought it for five tween euros and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews here either people bashed the movie to say it was bad or people said the movie truly was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla bla flick i then baulk played the dvd not thinking about any review i fairly had read with an open mind and not expecting anything at allman i dont dwelling house like being this critical but the movie was genuinely bad ok im just going to give out some pointers of literal what disaffect i thought actingdialog the pack acting was so confusing sometimes flick the actors looter did a decent job but there moving picture were scenes were i could spot no effort at all from gain ground them the dialog was even worst i think it was probably the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie the talking along flick care in between characters seemed merely off facial expression not just bad but far away from the actual happenings in the movie the monologues of the female character although well hither aside delivered became boring and annoying in a little while but of course the most ridiculous aspect was the aliens or the infected i wont even comment on that rickety one just going flick to say that it beast was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture visuals the strongest aspect in the movie if you forget the awful fx and sound out light flashes they used to simulate explosions or just about what the hell they were supposed to be the camera atomic number atomic number in car aspect was quite cool actually but they didnt even used the flick environment to inspire fear or dread they left that to cheap sound and video fx and the atomic number three infected characters the movie becomes boring in so many scenes sound talk about editing this movie aloof has no problems in showing how weakly flick edited it was from computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the alien dialog ahso what did i like in the kayoed merely movie spoilers the only thing i just about really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the flash bulb car is still and surgery you spot flick somethingsomeone walking washington in a distant at first i really thought it was me seeing things but information technology when the washington character realizes that the figures coming towards her were her own reflection i was surprised pretty creepy idea done well apart atomic number from line that i had an awful timeand i dont recommend this to anyone not even teen get together because you cant even laugh at merely thisi give it a solid only some technical achievements worked here apart from that yeah nothing
1,just as ted kramer dustin hoffman is about to get a break in his professional life his frustrated wife joanna meryl streep finally gets up the courage to leave him leaving ted to care for their five year old son justin henry being a single parent proves to be quite the chore for ted and he suffers professionally but also learns theres much more to life than a career as he continues to bond with and really get to know his own son but then joanna returns and intends to get her son back which leads to a cruel custody trialkramer vs kramer is a superbly well written and magnificently acted human drama that will only leave the most coldhearted a viewer untouched hoffmans growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out it always feels very real and thanks to the films lowkey approach it makes even more of an impact and can easily work upon multiple viewings the films dramatic impact does not lesseneasily recommended out of
0,when i was new i was a big fan of chuck norris i just lead off getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes i remember that i truly like this one in particular and thought it was one of his best now that im a little erstwhile i can say that although its thoroughly median i still consider it one of his better films in an acting stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous series killer picture series killers are all the rage today and the great unwashed would like to think of them as a wholly s invention in contrast its skilful to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most plainly action movies as advantageously as stalk n slashers of s and s while norris attempts at both wittiness and any form of human pity are hamfisted and absurd nobody could kvetch someone in the head quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james likewise i can commend this film ditto for writing style legend billy goat drago as advantageously as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but its better than anything norris did in the s
1,bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film you might get more from than mosti that worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty to a long shower so that is some degree of isnt iti would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the is maybe a bit too uneven david is only in this brielfy so don not get up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look

0,some spoilers soap has some moments to recommend it when charlotte and veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful low key truly erotic scene i also loved the music score and the soft muted cinematography im not if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from being digested originally in serialized form the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying my biggest problem this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen life course she has to be shown as sexworker what else scatterbrained impractical absurdly frillygirly completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world moreover shes always shown with two days of beard for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is and shes waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward transitioning in truth the character resembles a drag queen someone in the of are typical fantasies of from the outside who really arent connected transpeople films fetishization of surgery is a way objectifying people who are going transition not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least at the least why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender i thought actor portraying veronica was but no better that much better was woman portraying charlotte very complex character full of energy selfloathing desire and contradictions if she was so fascinated by with female energy a charlotte could go out to a womens in two seconds and yes she was to veronica but more an abstract of someone with malefemale characteristics a gentle touch but with good punch not as a unique person yes what a says about love is often lovely and moving but that doesnt mean an stereotyped minority has be stereotyped some in the processthis film also proves that danes are lousy dancers for such promising premise better executed in a film like different for girls the final film is a letdown
0,this cinema has been known for their extremely erotic almost explicit scifi there are they generally do very well at these femalien in encounters this is films seems to be a a rehash of old tape any number of a some recognizable and others not girls in surrender film in all stages of nudity entry while also several clips from other films which are outstanding unless youve there those other films seen are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things some playing basketball others short still others playing with themselves the only thing of value but this tape particular the very last scene just talking virtual erotic girlgirl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable sandy wasko and are more subdued tammie hainum not highly recommended

1,ok so this film may assistance not have won any oscars but it is not a bad film the original doa is undoubtedly a better film but ampere that does not mean world health organization this film is washington badthe astatine film stars dennis quaid merely in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after the right stuff made him a star and a very thusly lovely looking meg ryan when she was still now quite famousthis is more of an update of the adorable film rather than ampere a remake since the setting is different and the characters too are different the plot ampere is pretty much the same a man this time an comprise english perform professor at the university of texas at oscar austin is poisoned and he merely has only hours to find out snick who poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college besides student who tries to help him jane kaczmarek plays quaids estranged wife in a look out low key but quite an intense performance scholarly person she steals case every scene she is in daniel stern also in an early role before home alone made him famous plays quaids colleague charlotte afterward rampling is fine too in a supporting rolethe entire ampere cast is top notch the film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching improve as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film
0,for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv serial it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv serial wallander starring kenneth brannagh people interviewed by the police are hardy and often as bitter as the weather the lead investigator has huge category problems investigations invariably lead to pitilessness of the distant past and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrence and subplots making good sense only at the end both have excellent cinematographythe plotting of jar metropolis is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard britain or us offence serial effectively you could take the plat of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the stark locale in this movie and have an effective sequelreally the script couldnt be more obviously from the cookie cutter you get even the most familiar of motifs such as the police going to the local anaesthetic prison house to question a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably break loose at the end of the interviewim dead convinced that this is scone and occlude for many family line but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not blend to the cinema to look on television what i felt a keen miss of was message the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland icelander in genetic terms have continue largely isolated from the outside world presenting a great chance for scientists to study their genetics lots of information concerning the genetic endowment of the population has been kept and many genetic diseases unequaled to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogeneous its like trying to set together a jigsaw perplex of the london underground map out instead of a jigsaw perplex of a field of view of daisies a company called decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland imputable to privacy concerns this see was terminated and at the end of last year decode genetics endure bankrupt in iceland the episode is a rich issue for debatebut in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for educations sake theyre there for weird atmosphereits a grisly movie if you are interested in that and theres often a morbid focal point on food to accompany events like a medical examiner who eats lunch in between incisions the most nauseated for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheeps point unfortunately for me this now and again become farcical the movie attempts the rather frail undertaking of mixing the grisly with the sentimental and ended up furnish unwitting witticism towards the end this is the equivalent in cinematic terms of attempting to prepare fugu if youre not wellqualified deft of deal and acute of eye you poisonous substance the client this rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performancei walked out of this movie palpate rather bad about myself and about sprightliness in general
0,mel welles you might commend him as mr mushnick in roger cormans little shop of horrors directs this somewhat interesting yet totally twisted tale of dr frankensteins monster daughter carrying on her fathers work after his decease and creating a creature not for its noetic power or its likelihood to bedo good but rather for its sex invoke you find out tania frankenstein though a doctor and scientist in her own proper is concerned with really nada more than scarf out her primal hope for the static male child and build some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love the write up is tissuethin here and one gets what one might expect good deal of leering and suggestive commentssurprisingly most from the female person guide special effects that are not so special playing that lacks profoundness of characterization and not really much action or suspense and while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling gentlewoman frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which wee it watchable not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless italian actress rosalba neri aka sara baybey plays the mogul daughter with some aplomb and good deal and good deal of sex invoke she oozes hope and seduction quite well her performance is pretty onedimensional but she is quite lovely and plays overthetop a little too well she is also very open with her performance if you pinch my drift miserable joseph cotten now baffle to european repugnance films for money plays the father in a brief yet competent performance he is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear as for the rest of the throw paul muller is somewhat effective as dr charles e g marshall the mogul assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village policemani wasnt buying thismickey hargitay starts to pump tania for answers despite what you might think not to her satisfaction where the movie really loses credibility is in the final rd of the film where the suspect script weak carrying into action and lackluster direction all head further south the creature is let on and looks quite ridiculous the film cease somewhat abruptly with one of the precipitous resolutions very common in the s while not intimately as bad and repugnant as some might want you to think gentlewoman frankenstein is indeed a very blemish film with some wayward albeit intriguing overtones

0,let freedom ring was probably made with the best of intentions but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final productthe folks at a western town where the railroad is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers working on the railroad being financed by robber baron edward arnold there are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroads path and these folks are dealt with summarily by arnolds hired men one man who wont give in is lionel barrymore whose son is coming home from harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the ranchers causeonly nelson eddy decides the best way to fight is to go zorro on the bad guys but other than charles butterworth no one knows hes the wasp a very interesting choice of names by the way what arnolds done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east getting the immigrants to vote nelsons idea is simple if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy arnold is theyll vote with the original settlers and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst he kidnaps newspaper editor raymond walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributedthe railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants not the irish working west or the chinese working east as history has it its a real united nations working on arnolds railroad the workers are kept in line by foreman victor mclaglen and nelson has the unenviable task of beating some sense into him like john wayne did in the quiet manof all the films that starred jeanette and nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo this was the worst of what they did at mgm nelson is about to be hanged along with barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best but certainly nothing worth being hung for and virginia bruce who plays the nelsons girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of my country tis of thee that the immigrants join in with in the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters arnold quite rationally packs up and leaves town to build his railroad somewhere elsei kid you not thats the ending here just what is the message vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with arnold but somehow youll get by here i do wonder some times if years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some towns where the railroad has come through that are now cities that the good citizens of that town havent rethought about what nelson eddy did if they did theyre probably running him out on a railnelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by sigmund romberg where else but here the song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country too bad it didnt have a better venuethe almost platinum blonde virginia bruce im sure is dubbed here and im sure jeanette macdonald was just as happy she wasnt accompanying nelson on this trip west

1,i admit act upon that for the first minutes or so of this film i wasnt sufficiency entirely sure early i was going to sit get wind through the whole thing like many other people i found it pretty boring and i wasnt entirely looking forward to an hour and be intimate a half of watching this guy bite icicles and language stick them together however if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is i really think desire its sad that so many people comprise found this impossibly boring or a retread information technology of ideas done ineffectual by other artists rivers and sense tides is a quiet study operation of some of comprise the artwork surgery and methods perform of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal perform process of ineffectual entropy it is slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a lot execute of the point of the look out movie is to show that goldsworthys art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated ive even heard people complain about how he is fairly always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which i just think is madnesson the other hand lots of people complain maine about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside contain them a lot minute of musicians verbalize as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing early the exact lyrics i guess im contain just the stand for kind of past person that believes hanker that id like to know what the artist was trying verbalise to accomplish with his or her artwork i can still take it how i want to even atomic number if i know what it was meant to do i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through flick the be intimate movie flick he does after all lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some enjoin of his work at more than one occasion but if you dont want goldsworthy talk about his art while youre watching the film feel free to turn the sound off thats like not reading the lyrics if you dont want to know what a musician distressing is singing and managing director would rather interpret the ar words yourselfi think sit down that andy goldsworthys work which i had no idea early existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and im glad that this film was studio apartment made in impression information technology order to comprise showcase it indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film ampere that can express it and i really appreciated being able to see the work surgery that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used whether or not you certificate of deposit appreciate certain surgery aspects of contain how this film start is presented goldsworthys work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is scarce not through with the star goldsworthys art is and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the film it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that
1,even if youre a fan of jean rollins idiosyncratic body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory for once theres not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight true to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the directors vision entirely yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity jeanclaude coutys atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe brjean aka gary sandeur contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesnt resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcoreshot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his michel gentil cashgathering xxx efforts most notably french fck film royalty brigitte lahaie in the demanding lead playing elisabeth rather well i might add shes picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert vincent gardre driving home at the end of a long work day barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting roberts name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin further credit to brigittes thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the s because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure fundingwhen robert leaves for work hes inevitably erased from elisabeths feeble mind a mysterious doctor comedian bernard papineau effectively cast against type and his menacing assistant solange striking porn starlet rachel mhas move in on her during her protectors absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from here we get one of the movies strongest scenes as shes reintroduced to her roommate catherine the late cathrine greiner aka hardcore performer cathy stewart in a quietly devastating turn both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherines unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup its also catherine who gets to voice the filmmakers compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted themseveral rather explicit if not quite hardcore sex scenes make up the movies midsection and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain plumey aka cyril val jacques gateau and elodie delage along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of plumey was only present in the films rarely screened xxx version filles traquees the pivotal part of vronique a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique journet in her unforgettable debut who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirellis la traviata the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplins modern times as elisabeth approaching complete meltdown by now and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge clumsily clasping each others outstretched hands

1,agree with previous comment in naming the content everyday madness but would like to specify that dog days is about how women are treated in a male society the episodes we get to see here show some variation in discrimination of women categorized group there is a senior man who his new partner look and the way his late wife had treating her like a doll shall act worthy of wearing the formers there is a middleaged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a violent master we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitors a young adult man makes clear to his friend a girl who is really troubled by being enough for him that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette finally is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a hitchhiking woman to a furious who taking her for in his car natural beats her up to complete the we find the pal of the man in the masterslavecouple collectively her threatening and humiliating the her for shall get rid of her partner and take as her new master during all this the inhabitants of lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under burning summersun absolutely motionless sic have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic that still reign the relationship between women men but what i have convincingly analyzed the repertoire discrimination probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive what goes wrong due to good visualization
0,the film moves along well the acting direction and leave a to be characters are mostly lifted from other films and the vinnie jones lookalike straight out of gone in seconds the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of the stupid dealers in lock and the shoot out that leaves dead should never really know whether to or just sit there in shock this movie had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut at the details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once belief has been one just become increasingly critical a cos it was a attempt and although eastwood is for saying thatll ok for a scene he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood here a bit imagination with the camera and and a bit coaching and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference
1,see thought this was a really great movie especially since it was good filler for me i was bored true got it from the library and i really enjoyed myself it watched it twice in the two days and the more i watch ive the more i like iti thought was the plot was cast to be which corny but thought the end it really could be said that it would be what i liked the main characters and i thought that they were well going and you could i true friendship the in they all did an excellent job i ending that goodand you really hate the bad guys and you really like the jut guys really is i a supposed is movie to be like
1,this solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark but hopelessly contrived plot a true crowd that will have you howling with laughter well as rolling your with disbeliefits the old psychopath on a train story but that of no big importance as the portion of the film almost seems to merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian gustafsson his hapless nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that rivals chasethe thing the film that appealed me the most however is that wedged between the improbable and are the accurately everyday joys and nuisances of train travel they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognitionthis thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of suspense from hitchcock and should in my opinion only be watched for its comedy value which is high indeed besides gustafsson lars ambles solid performance as is the price admission aloneheartily recommend
0,the female cast of this movie is terrific youve got linda blair maturing nicely julie strain who doesnt get too many speaking business thats a good thing rochelle swanson equally convincing as a sweetly innocent girl or as an evil possessed girl toni napoli and the most beautiful of them all imo the simply stunning kristina ducati how the goofy male person lead larry poindexter merited to get sexually involved with any of these women persist a enigma nonetheless beyond the happen to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women the movie has little to tender the plot is disjointed and doesnt really get going until the cobblers last minutes or so and when wynorski lastly manages to create some suspense a ludicrous twist ending comes and ruins everything

0,i am always wary of taking too inst a disfavor to a film look at it a month later and you might see it other than or dig it up after years in a different celibate and some fad follower find something stylistically noteworthy that run short unnoticed at first after sit through the not bad ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it come in as no surprise to me that i chance the interrogate and answer academic session afterwards more interesting than the film itself shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival aided by the films director and producer gave a spunky defence force of a movie than invite an overall damaging response from the audience edinburgh festival audiences are not well shocked only single person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film include very articulate and constructive single from the consist public as well as an actor and a woman who learn ma film directors this was not an overly ishocking film there was a arcdegree of uninterrupted intimate violence but interahamwe less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite irksome where the acting banner were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to unwieldy and pretentious filmmaking on the promise of a controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are hokey overemphasise and sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is indecipherable and the figleaf reference marquis de de sade as single audience member put it seems a simple tokenistic rationalize for lack of plot maturation towards the finalewe have the story of an adolescent who has a sealed amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but need drugs and hangs out with youths who have trivial or aught going for them and whose criminal bodily function extend to rape and violence when pushed robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside himthe film is not altogether without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way was it the influence of his peers why did all the good mold and concern from parents and instructor not manage to include him in a better approach to sprightliness cinematically there is a carefullymontaged scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs shyness a latent sense of morality or just wait his turn several of his friends are ravish a woman in a back room partly glimpse and framed in the sum of the screen out in the foreground of the bare pearl flat a disk jockey is more concerned that the girls screams interrupt his well chosen home music than with any cerebration for the woman ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their bodily function attract police attending the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones use of his music yet when he get laid a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a profoundly unsettling way robert drop off with his back to us in the foregroundbut the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic intimate violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention if they puke we have succeeded in producing a reaction but for the most part and as interahamwe as i can narrate the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes they smell why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality filmmaking director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not highly developed artistic vision his reply about holding up a mirror to sprightliness to narrate the truth about things that are swept under the carpet yet his defence force that there is trivial plot maturation because he didnt want to do a standard hollywood movie all are good resolution to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone shit or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to hear and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt i address to him for a few minutes after the screening but i chance him as repellant as his movie and soon incite to the bar to moisten my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths single vista of prowess is to civilise another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mention sight loach single of the many not bad names he need in self conceited without going so interahamwe as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to narrate the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director or else a disingenuous assay to put himself on the map by courting publicity for irregular rate workandy andy warhol could rouge a tin of soup and it was prowess clay hugh would similar to emulate the not bad directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries woefully his ability at the instant only extends to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film
0,my first review of is into the blue the reef the narration is about two divers played by chris carmack and laura vandervoort who love to explore shroud treasures at a freighter of a topical anaesthetic reef one day after a day of search they are approached by a couple played by st david anders and marsha thomason they tell the youthful divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and receive a rare artifact about columbus shroud treasure that is reported at the freighter of the reefnext day the four dive to the freighter of the reef and of rough cut after a whole day of diving event they receive nothing a few more twenty four hour period past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a john r major deadly diagram in which they lingo escape other than they will be shoot down they were hired to receive two grown containers one arrest a nuclear reactor and the other arrest a corethe movie also has a back narration about another person brother of the lead fictional character trying to patch matter up with his girl i reckon this part of the narration was a waste of clock this also admit a very steamy gender scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasnt needed to be shownhowever apart from that this movie does have some good submersed photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives sensation into the blue is a sequel only by name none of the original doer or characters return it has a dumb diagram stupid characters and a boring climax

0,im absurd big air of possible flicks and where films are this particular favorite of mine that said zombi bit one of the absolute if films i have fan seen so needless to the cant really enjoyed it its the best bad movie ive seen in the in while the story has some similarities with dan obannons return of the living dead but whereas that film was intentionally funny a one is the opposite mess also some of the most laughable acting ive ever witnessed especially things the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical the has effects death subpar and in many cases course and the are scenes sloppy float just downright stupid this of are makes it all a more fun horror spoiler the worst is the scene zombie the guy opens the refrigerator door rent sees the severed zombie head do then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the fridge obviously pulled out ineptly with a is of really latching onto say guys neck killing him zombie heads have the ability to often in the fan now from defies every law of physics known to man and its one of the most a it ever filmed thats just one of many string goofy moments long the idiotic it i i believe its gotten so high a rating here worst you are a ever of bad movies which yourself a favor and and this sucker
1,the spiritedness select here is unquestionably below par imo regardless of the geezerhood of the oav the plot itself take a leak sense but the characters dontthis might go picky but turn over that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you smell comfortable there as a human would any machine ever emulate human high handedness shortsightedness and avaritia quite a so effectively i incertitude it there are some cursor towards this in the picture but only when the team can be devil to put them in by and large the bioroids or whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters appear sloppy to methe main characters seem to have some kind of emotional web though no unaccented is shed on this little unaccented is shed on the backstory at all a great pity the short distance of the pic coupled with the rivet on mecha and the crime means that we dont see any type depth the groundworks all down yet were left with no cease product a range version of this oav would have made a great video episode once some type subplots had been establishedthe highlights of this short pic are the mecha designs and the actionespionagethe flaws really start to show through once youve had a chance to digest all the goingson so i couldnt recommend this for owning but its certainly worth a watch or two whilst this review is mostly negative i really do call back its worth your time to watch this but its not something to rush out and buy in a nutshell a watchable wasted opportunity

1,star rating saturday nighttime fri nighttime fri morning sunday nighttime mon morning mister bean sorbus aucuparia atkinson is in this world but not of this world his mind merely doesnt seem to comprehend matter the way an average individual would and his life is unity long calamity because of this getting himself into unceasing mishaps and army for the liberation of rwanda out zany situations which he is left to assort out on his own as he doesnt seem to commingle with anyone and he rarely speaks but he never hand up and scorn the simplest of tasks being a unceasing battle for him applying his own zany methods of lick the problem always pays off for him in the endto look at the sorry state of new british humour with all its focus of sex and general coarseness youd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mister bean was made at unity time theres zippo inapplicable going on here just beneficial clean u rated humour of the type tommy cooper and the like made in the s and i find it just as laugh out loud mirthful now in my early s as i did when i was a young boy in the early salthough i can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this reference than than meets the eye there must be a reason why he does matter the way he does and matter seem to keep going wrong for him as others have noted it looks like he may have a type of autism in fact im so convinced about it that i in truth recollect were a professional psychologist to break down him i recollect mister bean could be the first notable fictional reference to be diagnosed with something like aspergers syndromeif youd like to see some unfeignedly hilarious british humour at its very unspoiled before it all became obsessed with sex and coarseness then this would come highly recommended evidence like little britain do work because its substantially realised but its in truth just as common as the rest evidence like this show we were more hold back and civilised once and hopefully we might go putting out this type of humour more again one time soon

0,i bought this videodisc because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings aforesaid rated r for strong violence and gender nudity and languagewhich correctly imo should state rated r for strong violence gender nudity and languagethe word gender should come after a comma not an and because of the huge dispute in pregnant it make i mean a dole out of masses who have view this movie will consort with me that the gender and nudity component part almost nonexistent my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like graphic movie that is why i felt cheated storywise it was soso afterall who really forethought about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it i know i dontof course this is only my opinionjoseph

0,i find out this film opening weekend in commonwealth of australia predict with an excellent cast of book edgerton bloom watts and rush that the determinate story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath book in the steer role the plot was paper thinwhich doesnt inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus breaker point the support performing from edgerton in particular reassure focus from jordan positive his talent on show in bison bison soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the aboriginal australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early th century must have seen it but i cant help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to separate the real story of an aboriginal australian folk zep or was hein what i funny is a concession to hollywood and selling the motion picture show in the us oh well at to the lowest degree jordan and the producers didnt agree to lose the beards just to please universalguess i will just have to content myself with peter careys excellent secret history of the kelly gang

1,this movie is masterly directed by clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i think there is a sequel missing for this one barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions that is one i think was a real garbage but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films
