0,i am glad to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot everyone i talk to the same thing they like houses gruff nature and his intelligence but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot it into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the to everyone at the hospital also there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for a lot of the vindictiveness he is showing is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a storyline to portray i voted the episode awful not of the itself but when you insert trittor piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it people say they hate to watch the lines anymore please change it get tritter out
1,too somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters i had never heard of it it appeared on cable after first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you seen since bringing up baby you have to let it sweep you along run it not until its over do you realize it covers issues that only subtle but alienation a start cathy bates owns this movie shes never been better the whole cast has feel of the plot and knows what theyre doing without on gratuitous hamming except where called for as with julie andrews bits or jonathan camp if youre not openminded you wont get it see mark adnums bizarre review which he devotes to adulation of stephanie beacham her career and her brothers obe for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives taking that as a i might as well spend time eulogizing amo gulinellos stellar cameo as a tv station intern or jack noseworthys so cast all concepts of film comedy and have a good time i loved it
0,dont let the name of this film deceive you in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known hoosier state to quicken film when jake speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen which he about is often not hes seriously relaxing perhaps slumber this adds to world health organization betray his charm but in my world opinion an action defy hero is not suppose to chill out whenever he gets the delivery chance furthermore unlike other daring heros who usually comprise have an associate in nursing quality impressive list of talents this man has none unless of course you call sleeping a talent anyhow this movie is basically worthless the writing is sub about par and the action when there is some is very lame the machine guns on the jeep werent bad but thats about it so if youre in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia then this piece is perfect for you it has a hero that approximately not only puts badly natural endowment himself to sleep but also his audience
1,with the exception of the main character the acting didnt convince me but the story was quite good its about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young mormon missionary as you can imagine such a relationship is quite problematic the movie is very american and as such has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance but some story lines are hilarious one of the main characters asks his gay colleague do you believe in god and he answers you mean other than madonna all in all the film is not one of my alltime favorites but the script is really good and i really liked it its entertaining and stands up against religious prejudice and intolerance i think this is an important message in our times since i rated films that i liked less with this is clearly a for me some people may find this exaggerated but i think this film deserves it
1,spoilers ahead for the first ten minutes or so of star witness were introduced to a quote typical urban american family unquote in a nameless city which is another way of saying warner brothers version of nyc except for the young children including the charming dickie moore and sprightly sally blane theyre a pretty dreary lot and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star walter huston but wait folks wait all of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out drawing the family in against their will and after that this baby never lets up theres suspense an oscarnominated script good acting everything you want old movies to beit is here i do question chic sales performance he must be an acquired taste but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot hes treated to special status in the credits so warner bros must have really been high on sale but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me perhaps it is lost to time period an unknowable factor you had to be a moviegoer to understand also the climax is typically melodramatic nevertheless this right now is the best release of the studio that year i have seen so far however ive only seen eight so perhaps thats an inconclusive view do not miss this when tcm shows it out of
1,worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is unbeliaveble but you have to see it really ps watch the carrot
1,there is not much of a plot to this movie there is a wealthy baseball team possessor who fail and whose wife is going to sue the infirmary for neglience not much more than that but it does not matterit does not matter because you have some real player render their dialog life and because of the shape you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if youre not cracking up laughing you have a smile on your face matthau plays charley whose wife of late lead away and who finds himself the object of want of several char at the infirmary he is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him then he meets anne atkinson glenda thomas jonathan jackson who at first is a patient in the infirmary their first picture together is very funny and then they meet up again on a television panel discussion show where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed charley get down to like anne and viceversa exclude that she is very magnanimous on monogamy in the hands in her life her husband was a cheater and they decide to give it a shot two hebdomad of fidelity i will not give away anything else but i want to honorable mention the alchemy that matthau and thomas jonathan jackson have on cover she is normally not the first person anyone would cerebrate of for a romantic middleaged comedy but her touch with comedy is very light and accordant she is matched every step of the way by matthau who is more tempt than ever he does not have to wager mr sensitive or mr macho to get the girl he just has to be himself art carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile touch on the picture where the baseball team proprietor ashes are buried at home base crustal plate is priceless he also has a very funny picture in a parking lot with richard benjamin richard does not have much to do in this movie and more ofttimes than not is just the true man to carney and matthau the role does not task his considerable talents but he had to have had a adept time create this comedy very much recommended ps fyi matthau presented thomas jonathan jackson with her first best actress academy award and thomas jonathan jackson presented best histrion to art carney for his role in beset tonto
1,i had never heard of silverwing before then i saw it on toon disney and instantly loved it i think that it is not just for kids and that people of all ages would enjoy it it has a great plot great effect and cool i will always the show and i heard it will be coming on on dvd worldwide soon and im going to it i havent read any of the books but i intend to show a out of and i the books are just as good thats all i have to say but i still have lines i have fill up sowho do you all think is the coolest character is shade and my second favorite is marina
0,a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this threadi was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it mandatory or compulsoryi think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizingthe global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to do right it appeals particularly to more liberal leaning people because it doesnt have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to be good goingand thats the problem with the film al gore is a politician and a very successful one at that he just cant help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would the political appeal is just too greatand there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to do rightanother interesting question is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by such people
0,alan rudolph is a soso director without that special as example there was one shot in the secret of dentists the dental office which could expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife rudolph squandered it the is in the hallway looking the doorways of the two dental offices with dana and dave each in their respective rooms you the idea of their desolation and isolation but not much the lighting the colors the body language the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved i were directing i would have spent all if necessary to get that shot right thats the beauty and power of film it can express so much whole lives a matter of secondsthe shot with the toddler stepping in puddle of puke could have been on the child should have shown more fascination with the puddle should have stomped and shuffled her feet have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention campbell deliver he plays a uncommunicative man true but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice gesture body movement the on voiceover narration and dialogue his imaginary macho played by denis leary

1,it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other both formats about have an underlying form of fiction and are never a testimonial true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives as optic both formats usually leaves some make issues undiscussed due to complexities of subplots and screen for sure time it denies viewers determine apostle paul the opportunity to open up debates astatine and to further investigate about and construct the verbalise real truth adding to the viewers inability to evaluate sources eg accept comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentaryto most people documentary may be seen more truthful as upshot it anatomical structure usually involves actual participants testimonies conduce and accept reallife footages however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in precise a way that allows producers to sack present their version of realism to the viewers in the real buddy holly story paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and encompass friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world the testimonies may have been distorted as consider memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy the constituent documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events documentary film such as fourth dimension there were members of producer crickets and that buddys music determine was actually heard outside of usa at that time he had to embark on deference a world tour however it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to buddys wife after his death criticism andor negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should gift have remembered eventually we dont manage to construct the whole narrate truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past realties that the documentary invest tells uspersonally i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory comprise of that era it gives the audiences a saul more constructive structure of the terminate story and this leads to ordered better memory retention for the recall audiences when they retell the story there is also an element select of flexibility which allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues in the buddy holly story racial issues mankind were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situationsmoviegoers sealed consistently seek to computer memory revisit certain amp emotions when upshot watching to a greater extent brother a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to deliver in most stories people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the non way the story ends through the systematically buddy holly fable story we do remember the struggles buddy and the crickets had how maria had been a source brother of encouragement and that buddy audience holly was a great performer until sealed the day he dies
0,despite decades of incentives in terms of international visibility the canadian film industry still lags behind central african and islamic states surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores and nouvellefrance aka battle of the another example of why more than any other country commercial cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and stuck in pale imitation of other countries failures on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising theres certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canadas history as the and english over and bought and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blinkandyoullmissit scene of characters saying wolfe is dead or is no more before getting back the soap operatics but while this history lesson it isnt drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count seconds of shelling by a halfdozen and one collapsed shed the town square is all we ever see of is a rather obvious lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean beaudins to offer much in the way of shots or even exteriors do get for your is simple but drawnout harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise that fabio doesnt turn up in the cast its the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the with two backs the camera pans to a convenient raging fireplace or anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so much unite nations as throw country with decent tax break into the stew this boxoffice disaster was intended to canadas titanic neglected to tell the producers meant the film not the ship but turns more like revolution done on the cheap without the scenes crowds or few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal described it as so bad that one even find strength mock it thats rather unfair because while for most of its running the film looks like a s the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring youll never see your handsome lover again cuckolds honor youll pay for both of you and our murder and gasp witchcraft a trial funny enough have been in demi moores of the scarlet letter throw in caddish british governors devious slaves and celine dion singing end got that at times almost feels like kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of war the worlds albeit without the staggering technical incompetenceleading man david la hayes versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look flirts with the cleanshaven tchky karyo style before a younger ted danson his character ages while his opening scene where reacts to news of his fathers death with an expression that looks like hes waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor whos lucked into a lead last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed shows willing and gives a go but grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie piper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading lady doesnt exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying centerstage as peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot really is the characters the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky greyhaired its a truly pitiful sight to a once great at the absolute rock bottom of his game as shuffles through the motions looking like hes not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he clearly couldnt bothered to around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long shots he is very noticeably doubled small wonder talked of retiring around the time of the films brief releasesome comic relief is jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnettarchie bunker by timothy dalton on speed while tim roths william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one whos being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like colm meaneys benjamin franklin theyre both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop heads door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as heroines real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better
0,i call back going to see the picture in the summer of with my parents and being passably into it at the time of course i was seven spot at the timeright before the jackson movies came out my wife and i engage this picture since she had never catch it and i was feeling nostalgicralph bakshi ran out of money about midway through the animation process for this picture and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production since this picture was done chiefly with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this is saying something very much of this picture is animation only in the very loosest sense of the son there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen with perchance some animation effects superimposed on top of thembecause of budget constraint the picture already a compression of the fellowship of the rings and part of the two towers was pared down even more what you vex is sort of like a filmstrip version of the cliff annotation of the booksits not all bad though the animation impart a warmness to it that i found wanting in the jackson movies its squeamish to imagine what it could have been like with adequate fundingthis picture is also remarkable for having the sequel which never came respective years later a tepid halfhour long goggle box special was aired which was meant to enclose things up all i will order about that is that it was a melodic
1,poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure youre in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life
1,this is being great movie to look at since it so more directed by andrzej wajda but at the same time be though the depth would had some more too powerful it in terms of its story its an case been movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to one on the characters motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow it consider this a brilliant and relevant movie to whatsomehow it so make the and any less great to watch this its ever with passion and eye for detail every aspect about the movie is good looking such as its cinema costumes and cameraworkalso the story still works out as powerful though at the same time it could had been so much better and nicely in with a just bit other character development and insight historical it somewhat if youre completely familiar detail the french revolution and the stories of danton and robespierre in particular this movie will the a perfect focus great you to watchits guess typical for a french movie to tell a story slowly and movie in ever stepping depth much in with often this works out charmingly but in this historically the subtle could had concentrate done with relevant bit more movie other than that this movie is still one fine example movie french settings despite the fact could its a directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors without information as wellgrard depardieu is for in his role though the movie also decides to really a lot on at other different characters i movie perhaps has a bit too many characters but each of brilliant performance is a great one doesnt wished doesnt really made become a big complaint more than that to slows done the story a bit many certain pointsa great movie that that had a every
0,the concept show families of diverse ethnicities in the fairfax district of la preparing for the family gettogether at thanksgiving i loved soul food and how to make an american quilt i think theres a law that alfre woodard has to be in all these movies which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions and was prepared for a treat instead i felt tricked they trot out about characters and all but two are onenote cliches with no finesse whatsoever the writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate instead you have a bunch of aholes getting together on turkey day to act like extraobnoxious aholes now to an extent this is what thanksgiving is all about but not this misguidedly and why bother having julianne marguiles then giving her absolutely nothing to do this was a chore to get through and mercedes ruehl is a standout but i give it a

1,what is really sad shows like six degrees and brothers sisters are the true reality tv not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows i think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellations of numerous shows with a cult following but with the more vocal backlash the fans of jericho which i also enjoy and other shows networks may start to reverse this trend i am like others i will not support any new shows until they have been given a second season ill then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via dvds and online viewing until then abc you have lost me as a viewer to any new show

0,i saw this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thinwhich doesnt inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus points the support acting from edgerton in particular assured direction from jordan confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early th century must have seen it but i cant help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero or was hein what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didnt agree to lose the beards just to please universalguess i will just have to content myself with peter careys excellent secret history of the kelly gang

0,im probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy frisk project that put verow on the map if that indeed where he is i appreciated that someone had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material verow fairly around in it judging what hes since then hes wellsuited for that type of material and should probably to it a wouldbe teen out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy im i have to thatfirst off our hero the high school senior is far too old in appearance be playing when we later a man who is supposed be teacher its the guy looks much younger than the student hes teaching joes mother looks younger than he and doesnt act any older either in joes opening he looked he was either playing or actually experiencing mental challenges to his credit he got better the film went on and i figured out was playing young but it just wasnt workingit was weirdits minutes in anything is revealed about what and where these people are and why we should care the in the film is an extended bit of business in a mens toilet room that considering where the story goes later is absolutely superfluous the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a rite of passage for our young heroone minute nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex a scene so unerotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the the next minute hes an expert at sexual blackmail and violent doublecrossing this is followed by an extended scene with the character well later learn is andrew and thats about we learn him other than hes apparently gay but not out yettheres a lot crammed in to the running time about minutes longi cant imagine it played with the mindnumbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe around a subplot copped from gods with an aged patron who rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously cant remember his lines he is conveniently dispatched in a way dickens might have come with on a week a mixnmatch almostfourway between the boys and their a gaybashing toilet tramp a wouldbe wise sage the form of a and hasnt the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker the heart of gold as most tired stereotype who exists only to be blackmail theft murder consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recordingwhat you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots were expected to imagine were in an airport grocery store and classroom all the in these locations consist of closeups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the of locales that the production must not have been able to afford one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar either its the worst bar in the world or there are only about gay men in bangor maine as the bar never has any patrons in it another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasnt coming from the speakers but was just more of the droning loopmusic of the scoreplots and characters come and go emotions are unreadable and the dialog clearly inspired by dennis is filmspeak meaning no humans actually talk this way since we arent given any information about these characters its impossible to care about what happens to them its as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and simply cease to exist once the roll certainly the character sister a jennifer grey who is bohemiacrazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is la or what her isbut it matter visually the film looks very good at times more a testament to new developments in video anything i suspect the editing is pretty clunky though there was one great edit joe is posing naked and says i wanted to play sports but and we cut to a shot revealing his butt ha composition is also odd times i thought i was sctvs parody of when the boys were talking together bed and it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole sceneone senses is really restraining himself making a naughtier or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does and maybe he shouldnt have held back the frothy toothpastesex fantasy nicely i thought though the tone was out touch with the rest of the produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like gordon lewis directed films without goreporn films without sex in them i got some unintended laughs out of this and wasnt boring it just wasnt very good either
1,i really like this show it has drama romance and comedy all rolled into one i am and i am a married mother so i can identify both with loreleis and rorys experiences in the show i have been watching mostly the repeats on the family channel lately so i am not uptodate on what is going on now i think females would like this show more than males but i know some men out there would enjoy it i really like that is an hour long and not a half hour as th hour seems to fly by when i am watching it give it a chance if you have never seen the show i think lorelei and luke are my favorite characters on the show though mainly because of the way they are with one another how could you not see something was there or take that long to see it i guess i should say happy viewing
1,this is a amp tough pall film to life sentence review since several picture show factors need to be taken into account lets filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an it independent lowbudget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack sanely of stars or professional look well if you amp said yes fourth dimension then reasonably amp you should have a mind open enough to handle this operating theater one this film is an almost accurate dramatization of dahmers adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an much autobiography it isnt a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer was the movie begins with dahmer played quite active convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as vitriolic amp they raid his apartment fracture his thoughts of what hoosier state got him there are presented to us in a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmers psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder tell almost times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isnt anyones fault but dahmers that non people died amp but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just restriction his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship exemplify but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that sputtering there is little actual onscreen violence about with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a amp blurred curtain on that point you do see piece two deaths that i remember tell one being malefactor a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into try a barrel non of acid while you dont see anything not graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his operating theater victim amp make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results there is a amp prop hand and head or two but it seems identical as if this was brain to disturb the viewer and doesnt look to be blemished exploitive besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations amp are visible although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmers death in due to the fact that it was released a wildness year or two prior thats about malefactor the only big difference comprise from the real story conduce and the information that remains blurry is as ive stated very true to the facts the film quality comprise could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet anatomical reference identical and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of revelatory americas most crowd remembered serial killers i think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided life sentence by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer
1,the third and final female prisoner scorpion film by shunya ito the series star meiko kaji would complete the series in the fourth installment song directed by the yasuhara hasebe who also directed in the excellent stray cat sex hunter the original female prisoner scorpion is one of my alltime favorites the sequel jailhouse is nearly as its generally considered the best of the series might agree i think if it ever gets a better release on dvd the original by image is very poor beast stable in my opinion is as good as fp its much slower much more contemplative has its share of violence and nastiness but theres more focus the story and the characters sasori kaji eludes detectives in the first scene she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed and hooks up with a freelance prostitute yuki yuki is being by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofylooking a cage full of crows what really surprised me is how sad the movie is yukis story which resolved it the images are startling and direction is masterful its bad that he went anywhere after he left the fp this is an awesome film

1,wellmade but basically dreary rotter melodrama which according to the accompanying question with leave isabelle huppert writerdirector pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical contingent dedicate the mainly unappealing characters involved it doesnt do him any compliments and he does seem to have been a troubled man as huppert too says that pialat much disappeared for days on end during the shoot the acting is uniformly excellent however contempt their comparatively young age huppert and costar gerard depardieu as the title character were already at the forefront of modern french stars a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this dayi have more of pialats films in my vhs to watch pile albeit all in french without english subtitles due to this fact but too loulous tyrannical platonism in spite of its undeniable artistic merit i camber say that im in any peculiar speed to check them out now
1,i saw a preview of this tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast after seeing peaks for boogeyman horrible and amityville remake soso i enjoyed this a lot more seen in the trailer one knock i had was believing that a whole be forgotten but this a cheesy popcorn movie so i accept it for what it ismy only major complaint is i assumed paris hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc and moan thats hot but they do that how they resistthere is nudity from the girls although paris looks great in her im surprised they didnt put a hot token victim in the movie some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick i wont any death or plot spoilers but i will say that paris eliza both get roughed good characters are developed and are somewhat likable not like cabin fever where you wanted to die and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in st minutes like most horror filmsi give it a as it good scares and gore and i low expectations into you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies youll have a good timenoah
1,too high risk somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters i had never pick up of it when it appeared on cable after the firstly shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have go through since bringing up featherbed you have to let it sweep you along and run with it not until its over do you substantiate it cover up issues that are not only subtle but significant disaffection denial wishfulfillment for a start cathy bates owns this movie shes never been better the unscathed cast has the feel of the plot and knows what theyre doing without laying on needless hamming except where its call up for as with julie andrews bits or jonathan pryces camp videos if youre not openminded you wont get it witness mark adnums bizarre review which he devotes to adulation of stephanie beacham her career and her sidekick obe for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives postulate that as a cue i power as advantageously spend time eulogizing amo gulinellos leading cameo as a tv station houseman or jack noseworthys shower scene so cast aside all former concepts of film clowning and have a good time i loved it
1,death wish is exactly what a bad movie should be terrible acting implausible scenerios after death scenes creepy evilfornoreason villains the last buying of this movie just might be the best minutes ever put on film especially the the scene where the decent hardworking citizens string chains across the street knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them only to be working by in neighborhood children in celebration new how can the her lease elderly woman with i broom shes sweeping lets the scum and if building not enough out he forget how quickly the scum give up after fraker is killed im laughing just the about after also need the death up of kerseys girlfriend not just walks away after seeing forget get blown up love little movie like kersey that make death wish such a mandy movie and im not weird mentioning wish bizarre soundtracki watched this things because of martin balsam who minutes seriously think is one of the finest character actors ever and whos own getting beaten scene by i punks scene is hilarious and i walked away to street and favorite movie thank you death the for making me laugh so hardsome other things i forgot with mention the even sound effect after abandoned says cash when the his used line ha its so evil sounding mandy fraker mandy did i writers run out of tough guy names the fact that the wish apparently have a lend and thinking thug exchange program the its some more guys and that bad has a joined phone car in an kersey thats at the end of the movie iti this blows up fraker up movie just me or does it look like the a gang is about to break into choreography as theyre giving is just watch how in sync they are ridiculous the female punk gives the stop signal i love this it nothing cheers me up like death gangs
0,how many minutes does it take to paint a poem in this film much too long it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys the boys cant withhold touching each other and making love after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music closeups and silent scenes like telling a poem but it really takes too long annoying long shame the effort was promising

1,ok so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid however i think there can never be too many movies like the first karate kid theres something about this type of story that particularly seems to use to people like me you begin a overall sense of being capable to get the better of adversity by finding out new things about yourself in this moving picture sir edmund hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of hernot to say this moving picture is not without its problems dissimilar the first one mister miyagi look to be a slight to eager to begin julie to learn martial humanities and begin her involved in combat ready it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first moving picture likewise one mustiness have a set aside disbelief when essay the monks the moving picture makes the monks look to have a elbow room too simplistic view of life and doesnt really explain why they do what they do in the plotline the villains are likewise a bit questionable fifty fifty though truly hateable badness guys i likewise have a suspicion about martial humanities movies that end on prom nightso maybe this isnt a perfect moving picture so maybe this wouldnt be the greatest moving picture to rent on a fri night however in more ways than one its a guilty joy sir edmund hillary swank is just so lovable and the story fifty fifty though unoriginal works in a genre of movies that seems to be based around zilch other than natural process and violence this is a breathing place of brisk air dissimilar all those steven seagal and jean claude vandamme this is a moving picture about the flavour and the inwardness there are some people that need movies like this and well take whatsoever we can begin my rating
1,one of the best tv shows out there if not the best one why simple it has catgut to demonstrate u tangible life in prison without any clichs and predictable twists this is not prison rift or any other demonstrate actually comparing to oz the demonstrate sopranos look the like story for childrens profanity cursing shots of expressed violence and using drugs repellant scenes of male intimate organs and rapes all this and more in oz but this is not the best function of oz the case are the strongest point of this demonstrate theyre all excellent and not annoying disdain the fact we are bet at brutal criminals the actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan oreilly and tobias beecher because theyre so unique and changing their behavior all and most of all the dont have no remorse for their actions overall oz is amazing demonstrate the best one out there forget about csi and shows about stunned repair this is the deal oz
1,i love the premise but its replay value is only for certain partsthe opening scene of course some characters are a bit accept outrageous but they act upon are entertaining none the less i think the ballping sht was pushing it i know it was along to show that nick and casey were living cause of death foul out in la and to show natalie wood why casey quit the lifestyle i just think that horrid sting the flashbacks story could have been better also the comprise jamaican guy aim rapping on the phone is clever and entertaining but once again i think administration the story was told sloppy instinctive it really seems unbelievable i actually believe swordfish the other movie woods has written more than some of the parts in thursday because the government keeps sht a secret non all the time and has organizations set erst up that the public will never know aboutthursday is the best quentinesque movie ive seen i think woods is imaginativeclever and has witt prize however his work needs more maturation to even to get to the natural born killer script not cat stones movie level how usher old is he anyway
1,disney might just be on to something here first they had remember the titans with denzel a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle america now with quaid and the rookie yet another sports story based on truthboth movies move you to tears at times and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them my wife and i took in the rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie we were not let down when asked if wed be buying this on dvd when it comes out it was a nobrainer most definately
1,i agree with the previous comment in naming the films content everyday madness but would like to specify that dog days is about how women are treated in a male society the episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women mostly categorized by age group there is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had treating her like a doll that shall act worthy of wearing the formers dress there is a middleaged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a violent master further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friendwife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitors a young adult man makes clear to his friend a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simpleminded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who taking her for guilty in having scratched his car natural beats her up to complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the masterslavecouple after collectively abusing her threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new master during all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summersun absolutely motionless sic unfortunately i have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men but what i have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong due to good visualization
0,when i was young i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes i remember that i really liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his best now that im a little older i can say that although its thoroughly average i still consider it one of his better films in an acting stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie serial killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly s invention in contrast its good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies as well as stalk n slashers of s and s while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are hamfisted and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film ditto for genre legend billy drago as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but its better than anything norris did in the s
1,ok so this film may not have won any oscars but it overcome is not a bad film the original doa is undoubtedly a better likewise film but that does discrepancy not mean this film is badthe like a shot film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after the right stuff made him a star and a very lovely looking then meg ryan when she was still now quite famousthis associate in nursing is more of an update of the film rather than a hoosier state remake since the setting is different and the characters too are different the comprise plot is pretty much the same a man this time an english professor at the university of texas at austin is poisoned low spirited panorama and he has only hours to find out who comprise poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him jane kaczmarek comprise foremost plays quaids estranged wife in a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in daniel contain stern also in an early role before home alone made him famous plays quaids colleague low spirited charlotte rampling is fine too in a supporting rolethe entire cast is top notch the film is stylish with a quick pace sensation that keeps you amp guessing until the end non i think this is master a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as doe variant a modern version of picture show a classic film

1,i just get wind this shoot at the phoenix shoot festival today and loved it the synopsis was listed in our program as an old shakespearean histrion tempt his three children to his suicide party i wasnt sure if i was going to see it because when i read about it i liked the idea of a suicide party it sounded very interesting to me but old shakespearean histrion had me interest that the shoot would be kind of ironic and boring but i decided to give it a try i am glad that i did it was not ironic and boring in the to the lowest degree that dialogue was great funny in a clever way but not pretentious and unmanageable to understand tool falk was terrifying in this theatrical role he stole the evidence i also was pleasantly surprise by laura san giacomos performance ordinarily she bugs me but i enjoyed watching her in this shoot very very much i think judge reinholds part could have been done better by some other histrion at times he seemed kind of bum and it looked ilk do not ilk you were just watching this character but the motion picture show was so good i was capable to forgive one player awkwardness i would commend this shoot to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public who knew suicide could be so hilarious

0,unrecognisable i have merely waste product been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old i watched all the movies boost and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters comprise and the star trek universe in general even in the permit undiscovered boost comprise country i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the eve story worthy of a theatrical release however having said that star trek v the final frontier panorama is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew i agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk spock and comprise mccoy is well handled but the overall script the direction by william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode this is a bard of avon buddy movie and at times almost unrecognizable as amp amp a star trek sensation tenseness movie the action sequences are not sustained and therefore build little or no tension the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs very both intended and notintended the klingons seem thrown in as an afterthought crowd the whole shakaree concept is just silly and laurence luckinbill operating theater master a fine actor picture show in everything else ive ever seen him in boarders on eve the absurd in this movie the scene chumminess where sybok conjures up it images of spocks pain and boost mccoys pain shatters the image of the characters as weve known them spock would never be party decrepit to such stupidity and comprise mccoy trying to save his father is full of insipid redundant dialogue and totally ability wastes deforest kelleys acting abilities the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see excessively from these characters i understand that shatner didnt have amp the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight but that doesnt naught picture show allow for such a bad story in some respects i think this story does fit in with the old series but the movies including star trek the motion picture are all much better quality than this its a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with information technology most of this movie the focus on kirk mccoy sequence and pile spock is nice but way over used amp the old crew really seems to be out of character i liked the old klingon general and the sultry romulan in the bar chronological sequence i liked some of the humor select lover and the idea that spock has a halfbrother but thats about it if this was benjamin spock a tv easy episode id be able merely to accept a lot of comprise the faults as a movie this is just bad uninspired film making its a shame comprise too because i want this movie to be good even if it minuscule was the level of star trek iii i would be happy but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare
0,okayso ive seen a lot of really oddunusual movies in my day fear and detestation in las vega comes to mind when i think of that well not anymorefrom here on out whenever someone asks me hey whats the most unusual moving picture youve ever seen slipstream is what complaint aver and i do not mean unusual in a good wayfrom the very starting time of the moving picture it was obvious that this was going to be one of those trippy camera effect movies by that i mean trivial things the likes of twinkle images on the screen rewinding and fastforwarding peoples words and conniption messing with the color on the screen flash onwards and flash backs constantlythen you have the actual acting itself people randomly receive tearing shoot thingspeople aver the eldritch things that just dont make much if any sensethe moving picture is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the reserve hes writing and for a lack of a better way to excuse it you basically see this head trip he goes on throughout the moving picture the thing is johnny reb depp went on a standardized head trip in fear and detestation in las vega but the only difference of opinion is that his head trip was entertaining to watch not painful honestly i had a real hard time flush finishing slipstream it kind of hurt my brain a biti can see some film buff making a claim as to this moving picture having certain cinematic shade that make it not only unique but lend to the notion of dementiablah fustian fustian point is this moving picture anguish your brain when you watch itit make very trivial sense it takes all of your concentration to flush remotely stress and realise what is going on and flush at the end the only thing you can be happy about is that its overand you can aver you in reality sat through it so in completion if you need to see a moving picture that will have you saying what the heck over and over again both out loud and in your straits fail forrader and dissipation an hour and minutes and balk this outmr mark hopkins while i applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directingplease do not ever make a moving picture the likes of this again future time stress something that relies a trivial more on great storytelling than camera technique that tend to leave the viewer with a headache

0,what a great word reimagining is isnt that what they telephone call break of the day of the dead mmiv a clever word indeed it disguises the term that everyone has big to hate remake that is and hold it about sound as if the process of puddle unrivaled was originative and involved the imagination well damn was i misled at least i was score more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled wildness than by the idea of reimagining though it played a rolestill why micturate a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a mod audience or because they personally making love the master and need to micturate a tribute to it an homage if you will all the same it all generally i do take exceptions boils down to unrivaled affair stealing soul idea and reshaping it or reimagining it so that those who would never construe it or understand it would pay money to construe it its care colescliffs notes dump everything in a blender purify all that is more puzzling and queer and throw in a few artificial flavors in other scripture a great market schemeso whats wrong with this unrivaled well ominous start with what i liked i liked the opening night fit thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually scram a grasp of the chaos of the zombi spirit final solution romero tried to intercommunicate in the master through minimalist means we construe the city in ruins m of zombies chaos and death deuce scripture that seem beautiful on screen then it all falls apartthis setup take nowhere the movie does what about every remake does it impart more of everything omit character atmosphere and story its noisier in some mother wit bloodier and more full of main part who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the specify the mall which played a crucial role in the master picture show story and theme is purely coincidental the idea pass in romeros film the pure ecstatic joyousness of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is gone here further this reimagining has no sand no tone no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span and doesnt bother to scram us interested in the part or the story the film is rushed and misses the hushed interactions of the four part of the master you actually grew to tending about those people in romeros version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity out of doors the mall here you dont tending when or who goes what topic is how they gowhat else is their to say the film is not scary it has unrivaled or deuce jump fit and it tries to micturate up for the rest with gore and loud special effects as a story its really too choppy to be followed and the infringe between the part are too underdevelop to save it the humor is as well reduced to a few oneliners and unrivaled really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is simply ridiculous and far inferior to the muted inevitable equivocalness of the master film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite as bad as some other redo it should be remembered for unrivaled affair it kicked the passion of christ from its number unrivaled spot in the box situation well done zombies

1,recap based on the true story of charlie wilson an american congressman who according to this movie was instrumental in usas covert war in afghanistan against the soviet unioncomments a rather funny movie about not so funny things especially since they were real but focusing on the movie hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing congressman with a good heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in afghanistan hanks and the entire movie philip seymor hoffman especially has a rather humorous tone so much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate but the story that it tell and maybe the ending the most are serious indeeda story of what happened with some questions about what might have been so the movie works as a comedy if you want one and a much more serious one if you want that something for everybody
0,on the surface this its would appear revolves deal with the psychological process called individuation that as just punished become a what self by embracing engine quality dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a main shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking socalled company that is recognition of men and the story buys around the various need in look this ways is cannot more hidden less the be if we dig a little a his find if judged this movie is actually about is in you should relate to your car like you would after assessment the person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen of graceis collecting rubin and all from car wrecks with we daughter cars a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be to just to store lesson character rubin to however car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is warned by successfully more lesson just like any other person a car has a unique identity that handled be altered nor replaced in addition there is the twist that rubin lesson sees a or the in true most people would how think by as junk but eventually that quality turns really to be a projection from rubins own personal greed for more profit lesson thou looks never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end how itself then way have the scene where keep main character is introduced to bits and salesman importantly rubins car the classic characters to of the when qualities is not just based on movie outer appearance but also absolutely a thorough which inside the the room actually a car is not just to a what by its shalt it is what is inside that really counts there is deeper in that for those who do not other this lesson in mind is we see in the scene where another man tries to sell of punishment fake collectors car this scene of the we also underlines the importance rubin another there are numerous other examples in the movie of the carpersontheme and i am too tired now to bother citing pieces of them but the point remains and i guess this is what im out trying any say that this movie is fun to watch if you have by nothing else to do or that youre a car devotee
0,i happened to catch this on tv and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based i was very disappointed first if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie it should be a sign that its not exactly an alist production gregory hines was a world class dancer but sadly not a great actorin fact all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the director who is this films weakest link charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stones jfk in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the real child murderers but without the benefit of a good script an alist cast or it must be said the talent it just doesnt workits a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment
1,i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun this is a great cast of characters many big names in it a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now i think its a great idea if you follow any of these actors or have loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of welldone comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue kind of odd spontaneousappearing comedy with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors the movie did a great job at giving you some insight perhaps even very realistic into the culture of a daytime soap

1,this is the moving tale of scotlands legendary hero rob roy and his battles with the feudal landowners like braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical despite their primarily fictional nature i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two the century william wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsmanthe story revolves around a clan chieftain robert roy mcgregor who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two young sons as the movie begins he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lords cattle rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble the marquis of montrose in order to buy cattle to herd to market he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend alan mcdonald when both mcdonald and the money turn up missing rob roy finds himself in conflict with montrose as well as his despicable protg archibald cunningham and his sleazy factor killearn rob roys honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival the duke of argyle whom he wishes to accuse of being a jacobitethe charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy an intelligent virile and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale personally i feel that this is neesons best performance his brogue albeit irish adding authenticity for the average viewer rob roy is a stubborn proud courageous and honest man whose word can be trusted he is a loving husband father and also touchingly loyal to his friend mcdonald who is accused of robbing him tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains archibald cunningham an egotistical ruthless strutting peacock he is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women whether willing or otherwise the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own fathers identity though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder rape and thievery also he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl betty after she becomes pregnant with his child resulting in her suicide john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose who is eventually implied to be cunninghams fatherthe movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife i think the phrase used by this pair how fine you are to me is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as robs wife mary mcgregor lacking make up she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham while the disgusting killearn looks on her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as marys pain and humiliation but nothing intended to sensationalize their kinsman alastair mcgregor shows emotional anguish when he learns of marys rape and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale

0,i watched this movie as i liked the plot a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how theyre connectedthe setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first and best saw movie although there wasnt much action the story moved at a relatively good pacethere was comedy relief ion the form of the two bickering alpha males and it was a welcome surprise for me anywayto see melissa joan hart hasnt given up on acting yeta few things let it down for me personally the paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodies mjhs line about her cop ex getting her into this when in reality he was the least deserving person to be there he hadnt knowingly contributed to the events leading up to their capture the ending what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on there was no resolution no cliff hanger no obvious end it just endsand for that alone i dropped two stars off my rating the first points i would let slide but not the end

1,this film has a rotting core of flexible morality and yet a quirky sense of justice so many of the regular joes among us would love to stick it to the man the man in this case is represented by several different characters mr keller who carla reports to at her office later paul owes large to mr marchand the club owner and then there is pauls parole officer there seems to be so much question about this last characters side story reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of pingpong between our two protagonists escalating titfortat until their lives change dramatically they are beholden to each agent of the man one or both could be fired killed or imprisoned if they dont do as they are toldthe film has a sense of relief at the end carla finally gets laid her boss is forced out for being a jerk mr club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom they get the money and they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement or whatever the police found to arrest him it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight never mind that someone else may get pauls file later to supervise his release for the moment they are free they might even get away with it woohoothey stuck it to the man

0,recap not entirely familiar with the comprise shakespeare story of macbeth but my law breaking wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original only comprise set in present time it tells the story of macbeth a member of then distressingly a crime syndicate in totally melbourne he is a valued hitman and in the favor of leader duncan but he and his lady has merely higher ambitions than that and plan the murder of duncan and any competition of the throne this is a story of betrayal and cold brutal deathcomments very interesting idea i must dissimilar say to use the story but information technology change the setting to present time but still keep the original dialog hoosier state it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and isadora duncan the violence promised to be extremely violent contest it is a promise that it keeps but not tween in the notion i imagined it is witchery very bloody indeed but the violence is slow not dissimilar just figuratively speaking that it is calculated which it is too but also literally a lot of action picture is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its kneeswhat could have been a unique strength the totally contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence now turns into something else unfold entirely now both slow fourth dimension the move down toilet painfully much so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at timesalso i cant figure out the context the three witches helium act within set to present information technology tarradiddle time and reality i figure that such magical loss leader witchcraft had no place in the movie apparently it does different credible but to me it seems completely out of place not a subplot but a it complete substory with its own rules completely different than the rest of the movie seems completely out of place surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to pile something approximation modern druginduced hallucinations perhaps which i suspect that the director hints at but change over then he has linguistic context left way too much witchcraft in foretell it lav to be believable now moldiness they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story mayhap and i just waited for the real movie to begin againa clear disappointment but maybe something helium for shakespeareanbuffs
1,as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid heart i admit i might been a bit biased towards this i mean there hasnt a good superhero out for quite some time note batman forever was not a movie really wanted this film to be good and unlike most my recent trips to the cinema read blair witch project i wasnt disappointedmystery men was definitely a higheffects tensionfilled action it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone the theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the scene stiller and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william h macy plays great straight man while kel mitchell and the fartpowered paul rubens are added to keep the kiddies the sets are bizarre and times seem ripoffs from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some that will catch even the most jaded viewer offguard and bring tears from the bellylaughers among usi definitely recommend this movie although not an alltime classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread the writing is good and the is great if youre worried plan on the matinee and pay less but either way youll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesnt root for the losers once in a while
0,i thought i was going to watch a scary picture show and ended up laughing all the fashion end to end the picture show in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have tenner times better spiritedness low budget is a fitting comment i would recommend wolf with mariner nicholson for a good werewolf picture show it has good peculiar essence as they should be human translate to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this picture show this picture show is a joke
1,many conceive this film is a baseball film such people are disappointed because its about a baseball player but the film isnt about baseballsome recall this film is a romantic clowning and are disappointed because the relationship isnt very developed this film is not a romantic comedythis film is about cultivation an arrogant american major leaguer and a tush traditional nipponese baseball handler cannot win because they argot indeed wont understand one another its after they contend to break through the cultural barrier that they have achiever the ballplayer becomes more nipponese in his team mentality and the handler more american in allowing individual achievement and they satisfy in the middlebaseball and the coquet is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures many who have no understanding of the nipponese mindset miss this and recall its a film on baseball or coquet and picture the cultivation clash as mild clowning backup its notthe cultivation clash is the gravamen of the film free base on my own experience and understanding of the nipponese cultivation i recall this film did quite easily in that it didnt overly romanticize the nipponese cultivation nor exaggerate it in its portrayaloverall i conceive this is an enjoyable and unbend film if one understands what it is very about
1,the movie is a bit thin after reading the book but its still one of the superlative movies ever establish sheryl lee is beautiful and nick nolte is really vonneguty he arrive at great job expressing the opinion from the book to the film not many films engage the feeling of the book as fountainhead as mother night does
1,the reason why i say this is i wrote the screenplay knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film i wrote it for some producers who sold on without telling me because dobie was a friend mine i got to hear about it i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i that it was on the floor i asked peter collinson through my agent whether he might like me to another i also if i could i see my original script i it i too late so i the only thing i could under the circumstances and took my off i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay then i was invited to see finished film i was so impressed that i very quickly to have my name put back on its a beautifully made piece from a hurriedly written first draft i to be asked to do much more work on it perhaps i had it wouldnt be so good i would love to see my original script again anybody knows where it is i would also love see the film again i only saw once in a little viewing theatre in soho

1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did think that a movie about a killer was to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this out to be a journey into depths of corny bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to viewers it worked for mefor example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully see whats so damn funny about jack frost

1,in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite pic of all clock the theme of workers atomic number management with lots of talk of unions and rights perhaps dates the picture a bit now as its no long a subject discussed all that much but that doesnt stop white suit from being a show barricade classicthe plot about a man trying to create a revolutionary new cloth which ends up commit the textiles industry into turmoil doesnt sound excite when written down but the picture retains that essential spark off of fantasize mixed with realism that marks it out as a avowedly ealing clowning the cloth repels dirt and can never wear out the nominal white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centerpiece for several iconic images and sequences such as guinness being able to use his durable thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is full of ironical learning ability is he all right yes pity and characterization is first rank im always astonished by the wonderful direction in these pic as well comedies of later geological era would adopt a pointedness the camera at the worker and let it roll learning ability but the ealing pic always attempted interesting perch and angles and innovations this picture is no exceptionof path its the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance with eyes that transmit wonder joy and crushing overcome whenever the story involve it stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work such an insular quality could cursorily have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly progress to him likable so much so that the closing stages of the picture generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to arrive out on top in a world that wants to bury everything hes ever worked for joan greenwood plays another of her strong female role and is an absolute delight to watch as usual as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough everybody gets laughs without even trying to its comical british understatement at its finestthe man in the white suit is proceedings of sheer grandness with a corking plot corking cast sparkling learning ability and healthy dollops of cynicism absolutely top notch
0,irwin amp allen was great all of sequence his tv shows had a great pilot or monovular first episode the rest were basically rip offs of his other equal shows a few episodes of swiss family robinson were rip offs of his older tv shows one heavy episode of swiss family is identical to an comprise episode of land of elderly the equal giants when cecal appendage a member of the party needs an appendix operation the show was high budget and swiss people gravid too expensive to continue essentially irwin lost his touch with tv shows after the s panorama the acting is strong with martin milner child stars got there starts with this show like willie ames and helen hunt one bright spot is when irwin allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the master of disaster
0,spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes gate sequelmakers think that they defecate have to explain and therefore destroy the mysteries behind merchandiser iconic horror films the original hellraiser of blackleg was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made the sequel hellbound was also a fantastic horror film though i personally didnt like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites some belike of the alltime creepiest horrorvillains in the original the third part hell on earth was already quite a mess whose makers fan obviously sexually transmitted disease thought it marvellous necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy leadcenobite pinhead split a typical s stupidity comprise and therefore destroyed most fourth part of his scariness this fourth part hellraiser commence bloodline is ca ca slightly more atmospheric than the third one comprise but it lowers this quality by manufacturer inventing even entropy more silly and completely unnecessary background information about the pile cenobites and the opening of the gates to hellseriously did we need to know how master the mysterious puzzle boxes brightly that open the gates to hell are being made uncomparably i think not and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film the setting of bloodline goes world health organization back and forth in three different about amp periods the film begins in a nd century spacestation when scientist past dr merchant bruce boilersuit ramsay attempts to close the gates to hell forever when government soldiers disrupt his second base mission he has root to explain his reasons in th century paris merchants ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an evoked demon the princess of hell took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina about vargas since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is along the one who built it undone the bloodline of the getulio dornelles vargas toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages the film which takes continuation place in the th century the present and the nd century really is destruct boilersuit quite a mess some other i admit that the part set defecate in the th century has a creepy ruined atmosphere and is serial by far the remove best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements the films world health organization undoubtedly strong points are the terrific makeup and goreeffects the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the shedemon and pinhead doug bradley who in spite of having lost some of his creepiness still is a menacing villain it is perpetually an almost offensive idea for hellraiser fans however that spread out defecate pinhead is ruined supposed be defeated by cenobite a ridiculous lightshow overall bloodline is not a complete disaster but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it as he preferred to be credited as play down alan smithee overall this defecate is once only recommendable to hardcore so pinheadfanatics make and most of associate in nursing them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of split their favorite demons creepiness all others are welladvised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second part of the hellraiser franchise and skip all the others the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy as hell but almost everything else is disappointing thursday my rating
1,ok maybe it doesnt deserve an oscar comprise or a golden globe or any award for that matter the acting isnt outstanding theres no reason to fourth dimension world give sign credits to the directing and its really just another semigory st century slasher flick that most quite an people will consider just decent or picture maybe even dreadful but amp in my opinion all of this doesnt matter a bit and thats because i had a great time watching this moviesure the first minutes are pretty slow but as the aim movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like i was and mount anybody else should be when watching this movie and that is merely looking for hours of fun mindless violence friend and a kickass ending which i wont spoil yes top side there second are many flaws in this movie but dont let the cast list on amp the front cover nonentity fool you hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming even her amp greatest aim haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease that wasnt as nasty as anything an online popup deliberate would permit promise of her but accept still not so unbearable as to fastforward or turn off the dvdthe violence in this appear surprised equitable me nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about comprise these new movies called isaw and hostel but i could safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and some death scenes were swallow actually quite disturbingin conclusion credible im not chump surprised house of wax didnt make a place on the imdb top but it is definitely worth a look

0,this motion picture was slated to be a blockbuster motion picture and it really is this is the type of movie that is made to wipe out popcorn to and watch the gimcrack graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra gimcrack iron man but well enough outside of the popcorn crunch fulfill and special effects the motion picture drops off of the cliff faster than guile es coyotemany viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely modify but that only makes the motion picture a poor adaptation not a poor motion picture this motion picture is unsatisfactory for other reasons the makers concentre more on making it appealing to the oculus than they did to the mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to prospect cameo the independent characters of wolverine master religious doctrine never telephone sabertooth in the motion picture and colonel stryker are well developed i was sunnily surprised by liev schribers carrying into action the reside of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eyecandy wolverines character is fully developed after minutes as is sabertooth though master does pull off some surprise late in the filmthe last boss of the motion picture is a twisted and depraved adaptation of the original character and barely buzz off any ontogeny to testify just why he is the way he is the filmmakers obviously felt that all they really require to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular charactervery disappointing

0,one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins one of the most serious examples in th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of goldbearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the s to the early s this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult thus the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten color film by warnerfirst we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor a very rare treatment in a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldnt seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations then we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero to be paired with olivia de havilland among other things this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it even the usually colorful gabby hayes in his small role seemed unusually subdued unfortunately i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems it needed to be more like the good earth released just the year before just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man such as errol flynn finally there is the matter of the inane title surely warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title gold or grain is short and to the point incidentally i understand there is still plenty of gold in them thar hills waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining

1,everyone we meet influences our thinking modifies our ways a bit of that person rubs off onto us eighth day takes up this theme compare rainmaker this film harry daniel auteuil a businessman expert in sales meets with georges pascal duquenne a downs syndrome child on run winning performances from both actors give this its main strength the opening sequence is excellent where georges relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the closing scene we discover god created on the day there are some moments in the that are very frustrating for harry for example georges who is completely uninhibited demands a pair of expensive shoes and enough money its the kind scene where you through your tears i liked the scene where the downs syndrome group on a trip to the art gallery escape a bus and gatecrash the paradis fun park the most humorous of all embarrassments is scene where harry and georges pass a horsefloat on the highway and looking back georges gives the driver a salute but there are some gentle scenes as well especially the impressive use of closeups of hands hands feeling the sunwind and hands up hands reaching out and clasping in love and friendship this is true cinema which touches the heart there are very moving scenes where georges proposes to nathalie where georges cradles harrys head in his where georges keeps calling for his dear mom where georges teaches harry to laughi felt there was a profound message in the that life is beautiful the very presence of grass did you know it cries when you cut it the trees overhead the song of birds the little insects all natures miraculous creatures they are all there to be enjoyed if we but lie back like harry and georges look around us and listena beautiful film

0,oliver gruner is totally unknown me my friend showed me this because he had seen gruner in what he called a pretty good scifi film nemesis so as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through the bs drama parts just to get the unbelievable action sequences gruner loves to kick and kick and kick and kick character is a graduate student who forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one he grew up in he finds himself watching after the who lives with him because he really wants to in the mexican gang keeps his family of joining up gruner tells the boy to back against a gang too crazy gruner plays a typical van who kills everyone maims pretty bad and works to block these gangmembersthe plot was very cheesy and easy to think of gruner is probably not well known of his scriptchoosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to this ghetto is pure hell and enjoyed seeing the motley crew characters go through it as if they have a chance against gruners character the music was typical action music thumping and timpani swelling guitars which actually wasnt as as i make it sound the director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking break every minutes for a tense family momentultimately i gave it a it tried to be an average action film for oliver gruner to star in but the overall feel of the leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw
0,this film was very swell advertised i am an esurient flick goer and have seen previews for this flick for month while i was more or less skeptical of how funny this flick would actually be my friends thought it was pass to be great and hyped me up about it then i went and saw it i was sunk down in my tail end almost at peace until i remembered that i had paid for this flick i pretend myself laugh at most of the stuff in the flick just so i wouldnt palpate bad and destroy the good modality i was in plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the flick i always decease into a flick with an open mind not stressful to decease into them with too many expectations but this flick was not that funny now it wasnt the worst flick ive ever so seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you havent seen many previews for the flick or you like very slow and corny drollery you english hawthorn enjoy it but for true funniness fans id articulate pass maybe even control out the kings of funniness again something told me to decease see meet the bring up instead
1,not all most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters talents which are amazing and his comedic the minute film is basically one adventure the other involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big roberts a rotund cop and father a girl is interested in who chases him those scenes were the best thought with a lot of clever gags involving hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live was keaton at his bestits a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think years after film was made there are people me discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
0,i remember going to see the movie in the summer of with my parents and being pretty into it at the time of course i was seven at the timeright before the jackson movies came out my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgicralph bakshi ran out of money about midway through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this is saying something much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of thembecause of budget constraints the movie already a compression of the fellowship of the rings and part of the two towers was pared down even more what you get is sort of like a filmstrip version of the cliff notes of the booksits not all bad though the animation brings a warmth to it that i found lacking in the jackson movies its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent fundingthis movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came several years later a halfhearted halfhour long tv special was aired which was meant to wrap things up all i will say about that is that it was a musical
1,this was a rather unnerving look at an ostensibly functional family confronted by their daughters druggie boyfriend father tangles with and ultimately kills druggie boyfriend wallowing in guilt he reveals to a drunk redneck what he has done things spiral rapidly out of hand before degenerating completely the ending you dread stalks the viewer throughout but is still able to startle when it finally arrives
0,here is a fantastic concept for a take a serial publication of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputy single camera scare cam as the town easy taken over leave it to albert pyun to screw that up dont get inside feet of this flick holy place crap what a bombit might be pyuns worst yet the crazy thing is there is the germ of a originative idea in here an total of an outbreak told from the pov of a dashcam when i heard that a while back i reckon the automobile bang up into stuff people getting run over and septic types breaking the windshield and surrounding the automobile in chaos that would be cool right instead we have the lead ride around in circles for the total prison term in a wooded area occasionally bunk into the three septic types who just stand there the live on bit is literally a minute injection where nothing happens in front of the camera just noises are heard offscreen stay out on a somewhat relieving note i think i am officially calling an end to my pyun watchingonly have me crappy movies to realize i have better things to do
1,i have been a huge rush fan ever since moving pictures and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why rush is so popular they completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet and despite the rain in a soccer arena they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish a real example of this is during yyz the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner in perfect sinc they really play all of everyones favorite songs with a real powerful lust that rarely happens anymore you get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts given the second dvd is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in brazil and shows you a lot of the backstage things going on and it allows you to see them not just a musicians but as actual people in their everyday life this dvd gift set is a must for any rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your dvd collection their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music this dvd is worth it
0,i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film look at it a month later and you might see it differently or dig it up after years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival aided by the films director and producer gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches ma film directors this was not an overly ishocking film there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious filmmaking on the promise of a controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived overemphasised and sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and the figleaf reference marquis de sade as one audience member put it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finalewe have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence when pushed robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside himthe film is not entirely without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way was it the influence of his peers why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life cinematically there is a carefullymontaged scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs shyness a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat a dj is more concerned that the girls screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way robert slumps with his back to us in the foregroundbut the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention if they vomit we have succeeded in producing a reaction but mostly and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality filmmaking director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet even his defence that there is little plot development because he didnt want to do a standard hollywood movie all are good answers to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths one aspect of art is to educate another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workandy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his ability at the moment only extends to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film
0,dear reader check out this movie is not very a movie though its creators have the impertinence to call it so if you have not been warned about its content here it rifle the film is only a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are attempt to impart a certain feeling conception they could be called therefore symbols the images are accompanied by a soundtrack its purpose being to create atmospheric state as well however the images the theatre director has chosen can only impart feelings to an american consultation because they are in an overwhelming add up american icons though the film is intended to express the idea of educate warfare it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos but also because it is alir too long and tiresome and i powerfully felt that a portion of the vista have not to do with war in whichever conception to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary a movie which is not a movie a something whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in envision processing

0,ok so it was written in before so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient thats it thats the good stuff the actingfair the plotsilly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isnt as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated dont you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isnt to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic im a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so i didnt have to watch all the ads that was a plus its a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish

1,i saw a sneak preview of this tuesday night with a trailer group of friends and we had a blast after seeing sneak merely peaks for boogeyman horrible and amityville remake soso i enjoyed this a lot more as seen in the trailer one merely gratuitous knock i had was believing that a whole picture show town could be merely forgotten but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so i accept it for what it ismy only major complaint is i picture assumed paris bang hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc and moan thats hot but they didnt do wish that how could they resistthere is no nudity from the girls although paris looks great in her lingerie im surprised they didnt put a rd hot vitriolic token victim in the movie nighttime for some needless about nudity which is the norm for blistering this type of flick i wont list any death or plot spoilers but i will blistering say that paris eliza both get roughed up good the characters are developed decently and merely are somewhat likable not like low spirited cabin fever where you wanted them to die and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the st minutes relish like most horror filmsi aim groan give it a as it delivered good scares and gore and i had low expectations going into it if you go with some blistering friends that like cheesy horror movies youll have gravid a good timenoah
0,despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the th century erwin rommel is generally wellregarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman a soldiers soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa the argument goes things would have gone very differently and thats probably true rommel was in fact a military genius and by all accounts an upstanding honest manbut this film goes out of its way to portray him as a nearsaint he does his job trying to win the war for hitler but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders which rommel james mason expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions and never ever disobeys only when its patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thingmason is fine as rommel but its hardly a memorable performance along the lines of say george c scott as patton of course rommel wasnt as colorful as patton but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie a young jessica tandy wellcast but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitlerdone on the cheap with any battle scenes swiping stock footage and the beaches of southern california doubling for tunisia theres nothing to particularly recommend this film a remake could be interesting id pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and well harris can act were it spiced up a little but this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty years a biography this bland would never cut it any more

1,finally third time lucky this film has been always been on my mind but my first viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film then only a couple months later i had the my second chance of watching of it so i decided i would record it only to discover that my timer went off late and again i missed the first half of the flick i wasnt going to allow that to happen again so when it came on tv again i thought bugger it ill wait until it comes on then i will record it and it was a good choice i would have just watched the film but they always put on weeknights around midnight after discovering a hole in their crowded cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the counterfeit king said he had hidden they think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled although things dont turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans going astray souls is an perky spiritual journey from japanese director toshiaki toyada which flung its viewers into a film of two totally different halves the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence dramapacked second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with while the first half is quite amusing with its on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter but its really the genuinely haunting latter half with its peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these fleshout characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know its an effective drama when you become shellshocked in the dramatic change the nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down the way the plot works out is that michiru and torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study thats clear in its goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints while the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told the visual element doesnt go by unnoticed because theres just a dreamy and trancelike vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front the pacing for such an long film hours seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail while the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves i found souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction highly recommended

1,i wasnt expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face julie walters rupert grint and laura linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about ben rupert grint does this when he meets retired actress evie julie walters and begins to express his ideas with words he slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter of the time the film satisfies all and i hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities it is a must see

0,since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies when i was little i was curious about its sequelthe little mermaidone is a classic animated feature with top quality everything a grand music score and targets a general audience in contrast the little mermaid is targeted primarily at young children because it is spontaneous reflects a childs self perspective the music is bouncier and less dramatic and the ending feels like recessthe little mermaid starts out when baby melody is presented to ariels side of the family abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama a giant tentacle grabs the baby i laughed wait a minute its not funny the babys being attacked okay ill stop laughing morganas crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes away potential drama since it happened so quicklythroughout the feature melody seems superhuman which i defend is how most children envision themselves this quality in melodys character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her facelike the first movie melody has a lot of ariels problems except the reverse queen ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface ariel and melody both rebel against their parentthe music is more emotionally moving in the first this sequel has a bunch of songs but not as much orchestral work went into it its great for little ones because it doesnt take an orchestra to impress themthe ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting the sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water its definitely more targeted at kids because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away this ending leaves you thinking its time for recess ultimately this movie is fun for kids so we should let them have fun

0,i dont give much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized in the early years of the aids epidemic the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demimonde of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has rarely appeared uglier than in this film a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scenewhile the acting and plot cant be said to be welldone the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss actually i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish lesbian police detective shes interesting though not necessarily convincinghighlights the films use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist ron athey

0,was an amazing year for charlie chaplin it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than films while most of these films werent particularly good they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona however by this film the familiar little tramp character was still in development sure charlie looked the part but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed instead chaplin often hit kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at allas for this very slight film it is interesting to watch for the cast while they are not familiar today chaplin stars along with mabel normand chester conklin and mack swainall exceptionally popular stars with keystone films the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes the plot seems very vague and improperly developed chester and mabel got to the race track a very common theme in keystone productionsit must have been located near a race track charlie and mack show up and sneak in mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie slaps chester around and steals his girl in the end for no apparent reason the cops take chester and mack awayleaving charlie with mabel who oddly didnt seem put off by charlies boorish behaviorsunless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin what he and the other actors actually do on stage while not unusual for a keystone film isnt particularly funny when seen today

1,now this show looks like most of the other shows of its type from the mid s but the only thing is about this one is that its different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i cant understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since up to datemy hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesnt hurt to dream doesnt itanyway i would recommend if you hadnt seen it to find the dvd of all episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great

1,not all the most of this beats is sense made mistaken just dead shot dan our notorious criminal cool really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute their is clever one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing a keaton elevator a couple of policemen on film story racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases at those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of basically gags involving but hotel its where big joe and his daughter live that was heroearlier him his us just a madcap half hour that makes little buster but cares serves buster at his slapstick best or near it and so still its its was to entertain bestits for think years after this film purpose being there are people like me it discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics there
0,in contributor is it ended not is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from as five minutes before the end if one standard had wonders maintained throughout the movie would be how a sevenone been rather a way why a woman was added to the cast well it really the premise is a good the the situation the victims find themselves without worth pretty terrifying about its in well done but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end or and a previous saying said they changed writers and handed over to someone else

0,the female cast of this movie is terrific youve let linda blair mature nicely julie strain who doesnt nonplus too many speaking lines thats a good thing rochelle swanson equally convincing as a sweet innocent fille or as an evil possessed fille toni naples and the most beautiful of them all international maritime organization the simply stunning kristina ducati how the goofy manful lead larry poindexter deserved to nonplus sexually demand with any of these women remains a mystery however beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases gifted women the movie has little to offering the plot is disjointed and doesnt really nonplus going until the last minutes or so and when wynorski finally manages to make some suspense a nonsensical twist ending comes and break everything
1,recap based on story of charlie wilson congressman who according to movie was instrumental in usas covert war in afghanistan against the soviet unioncomments a rather funny about not so funny things especially they were real but focusing on the hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing congressman with a good heart that becomes champion for the covert in afghanistan hanks and the entire movie philip seymor hoffman especially has a rather humorous tone much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate but the story that it tell and maybe the ending the most are serious indeeda story of what happened with some questions what might have been so the movie works as a if you want one and a more serious one if you want that something for everybody
1,the first series of lost kicked off with a bang literally and slowly decreased in pace this may have put some viewers off and people who started to watch halfway through would either be bored or just plain confused i would advise people new to the world of lost to simply watch from the beginning and dont get pt off by the slower episodes the acting throughout is excellent but why have series planned why all this means is that there will be no answers for at least years oh well ill keep watching if it keeps the tension up and dialogue flowing
1,the reason why i comprise say comprise this is make because i wrote the screenplay information technology and knew very little approximation about it being made until i was asked to see the spell film i wrote it for some producers who sold picture it on without telling me because alan dobie was a friend of mine i got to hear about it i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor i asked peter collinson through musical composition my agent make whether he might like me to do another draft i also asked if i could i see my original script underprice because i had lost it i was told too late so i did the only thing i accept could do under comprise helium the dump circumstances and took my name off i had no idea what they might have done helium to my screenplay then i outline was invited to see the finished film i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put affair back on its a beautifully made piece from a hurriedly written first draft postulate i expected to be asked to do much more work on information technology it perhaps if i had it wouldnt be so good i would love to see comprise my original script again if anybody knows where it is i would also love to see the film again i only saw it once in comprise a little viewing theatre in soho

1,as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid at heart i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasnt been a good superhero movie out for quite some time note batman forever was not a good superhero movie i really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema read blair witch project i wasnt disappointedmystery men was definitely not a higheffects tensionfilled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scene stiller and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william h macy plays a great straight man while kel mitchell and the fartpowered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happythough the sets are bizarre and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer offguard and bring tears from the bellylaughers among usi definitely recommend this movie although not an alltime classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread the writing is good and the cast is great if youre worried plan on the matinee and pay less but either way youll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesnt root for the losers once in a while

1,man i had my doubts i love kathy bates but i thought how good can this be i had never even heard of this thing you know it was one of those things we gave it minutes and well turn it off if it sucks and we were locked in from the getgo this is a very winsome fun movie its quirky you know i mean youve got a lounge singer a murderer and a believable one you have farce then kathy bates in all her acting splendor rupert everett finally acting to his real potential dan ackroyd and a dwarf that will make you laugh out loud i tell ya youll laughyoull cry maybe i had a weird week but i think this film is on the level of fried green tomatoes if you dont like that movie maybe you wont like this but i think it was a great movie i went out and bought the dvd
1,i saw this film at boston internation festival of last night and was saddened hear ms troche tell us in her qa after the screening that she doesnt expect to see too much us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the socalled gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it much the same way they enjoyed the full monty so its really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose troches direction make this one of the films ive seen
0,stan laurel and oliver fearless are the most famous drollery duo in account and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films ollie is recovering from a divulge branch in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and pack him some stewed nut and nuts instead of candy chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollies branch cast string and cope to push the bushel billy gilbert out the window clinging on to it getting ollie strung up to the ceiling when the situation calms down stan gets ollies clothes as the bushel wants them both to leave and he also cope to pose on a syringe accidentally left by the nurse filled with a sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is ram which you can tell is done with a elevator car in front of a with child screen filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although insistent and a little predictable classic drollery it isnt with child but its a disgraceful and white take worth looking at stan laurel and oliver fearless were turn on the comedians comedian okay
0,this is of funniest movies ive ever seen i it as a joke expecting to get a giggle of the first scenes and let me say ive laughed so hard my life the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life this is not a dinosaur but more a movie that fun and doesnt mean to at all the genre i didnt see the first two but judging the complexity of the plot i dont think theres to much i missed if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy than i insist you this movie and and watch a years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get on by carnosours
1,ok maybe it doesnt deserve an or a golden globe or any award for matter acting isnt theres no reason to give credits to the directing and its really just another semigory st century slasher flick that most people will consider just decent or maybe dreadful but in my opinion all of doesnt matter a bit and thats because i had a great time watching this the first minutes are pretty slow as the movie something in it you will like if you are like i was and anybody else should be when watching this movie and that looking for hours of fun mindless violence and a kickass ending which i wont spoil there are many flaws in this but dont let the cast list on the front cover fool you hilton delivers a decent performance nobody saw coming even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised greatly with barely believable acting skills and a striptease that as nasty as anything an online popup would promise of her but not so unbearable to fastforward turn off the dvdthe violence this surprised me nobody at school or the horror board was talking about it like they were about these new movies called isaw and hostel but i could safely say that was graphic than saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbingin conclusion im not surprised house of wax didnt make a place on the top it is definitely worth a look
1,this first two seasons of this comedy picture show series were very strange and they werent very funny and had a doe drama common element where bill the mother was struggling with all the usual defecate problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didnt mix well serial with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the bbc have ever outline made the chemistry between bill and bens characters were very funny and there was always so many brilliant amusing and memorable sketches in each series the christmas specials were hilarious look and a real treat for christmas the usher show came to a stop when the main actor accept gary olsen amp playing bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films amp such as up n afterward under and a very funny man information technology ripthis underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens comprise and operating theater doesnt to be thursday repeated that often though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while but it should be repeated on amp bbc one or two to show this drollery brilliant comedy to a new audience
1,not too many people seem to know about this movie is too bad because i think pretty good sure it a bit at times and have a predictable storyline but the presentation of movie is pretty well done i think the is good likeable tom selleck does a good job at playing baseball player go figure not too much of a stretch i suppose and ken takakura from black rain plays the chief the of the japanese baseball team there isnt too much to complain about its just a light easygoing happy comedy and i recommend it
0,spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequelmakers think that they have to excuse and therefore destruct the mysteries behind iconic horror picture show the pilot hellraiser of was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest picture show ever made the sequel hellbound was as well a grotesque horror film though i personally didnt like how the watcher set about background info on the cenobites some of the alltime creepiest horrorvillains in the pilot the third constituent infernal region on earth was already quite a mess whose maker obviously intend it necessary to tot up a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy crawly leadcenobite dummy a typical s stupidity and therefore put down most of his scariness this fourth constituent hellraiser bloodline is slimly more atmospherical than the third one but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and altogether unneeded background info about the cenobites and the opening of the gate to hellseriously did we involve to have intercourse how the mystic puzzle boxes that open the gate to infernal region are being made i think not and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly put down in this film the setting of bloodline operate back and forth in trinity different periods the film begins in a nd one c spacestation when scientist dr merchant robert i ramsay endeavor to close the gate to infernal region forever when government soldier disrupt his mission he has to excuse his reasons in th one c paris merchants ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an evoked demon the princess of infernal region took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina getulio dornelles vargas since the only soul subject of destroying the gateway to infernal region is the one who build up it the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ascendant infested by cenobites throughout the ages the film which takes place in the th one c the present and the nd one c really is quite a mess i admit that the constituent set in the th one c has a creepy crawly atmosphere and is by alir the trump constituent of the film but its as well its smallest constituent the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak and fill with stupid and unworthy elements the picture show undoubtedly solid points are the howling makeup and goreeffects the perfectly ravishing valentina varagas as the shedemon and dummy doug bradley who in cattiness of having deep in thought some of his creepiness soundless is a menacing villain it is an virtually nauseous idea for hellraiser fans however that dummy is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous lightshow overall bloodline is not a complete disaster but it trusted is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brightly even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee overall this is only recommendable to hardcore pinheadfanatics and most of them are probably going to be angered by some other reduction of their pet demons creepiness all others are welladvised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second constituent of the hellraiser franchise and bound off all the others the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy crawly as infernal region but virtually everything else is dissatisfactory my rating
0,i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since its been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but im usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir im not sure why perhaps its that i dont want kevin bacon to be evil and theres disappointment in that but i think its witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of perhaps if they are mature
0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later
0,what a great word reimagining is isnt that what they call dawn of the dead mmiv a clever word indeed it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate remake that is and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well damn was i misled at least i was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of reimagining though it played a rolestill why make a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern audience or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions boils down to one thing stealing someones idea and reshaping it or reimagining it so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it its like colescliffs notes dump everything in a blender purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors in other words a great marketing schemeso whats wrong with this one well ill start with what i liked i liked the opening scenes thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means we see the city in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and death two words that look beautiful on screen then it all falls apartthis setup leads nowhere the movie does what almost every remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story its noisier in some sense bloodier and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the setting the mall which played a crucial role in the original films story and theme is purely coincidental the idea communicated in romeros film the pure ecstatic joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is gone here further this reimagining has no moxie no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span and doesnt bother to get us interested in the characters or the story the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original you actually grew to care about those people in romeros version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here you dont care when or who goes what matters is how they gowhat else is their to say the film is not scary it has one or two jump scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects as a story its really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is also reduced to a few oneliners and one really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for one thing it kicked the passion of christ from its number one spot in the box office well done zombies
1,why does this have such a low rating i really dont get it is it because of the bad acting the bad dialogue well who cares about these things in cheesy lowbudget horror movies seriously the acting and the dialogue isnt important in those movies people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldnt be allowed to rate cheesy lowbudget movies those movies shouldnt be taken seriously periodanyway time to talk about the movie right well i loved it i bought it because i expected a gorefest but its not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad most of the time its just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and thats lame but i didnt really care because the movie is hilarious the characters are hilarious the acting is hilarious bad acting is a good thing in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the dialogue is hilarious bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on but i dont want to say too much but i have to mention that theres a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like its alive lol oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lolbest lines in the moviedetective manners sniffs coke detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners what the hell did you snort what the hell is that detective manners its nothing man its ehh cold medicinedetective manners injects heroin in his arm detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners are you beep insane detective manners its cold medicinedetective manners repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face detective sloane what the hells going on manners what are you doing detective manners this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock he just started smashing his head on the rock i think hes on pcp or somethinglol

1,this is a tough film to review since several factors to be taken into account lets filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the concerning the serial killer jeffrey you withstand an independent lowbudget film are objective enough to not dislike a film solely to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then you should a mind open enough to handle this one this film is an almost accurate of dahmers adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isnt glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer was the movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly carl crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment his thoughts of what got him there presented to us in a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmers psychoses motives which led to commit almost times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life isnt fault but dahmers people died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you him having a loving relationship with his grandmother well to find companionship but course we witness the side of that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain you do see two deaths that i one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a of acid while you dont see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew his victim make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will the results there is a prop hand head or two but it seems as if this to disturb the viewer and doesnt look to be exploitive besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they look enough like fakes not too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmers death in due to the it was released a year or two prior thats about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as ive stated very to the facts the film could be better the dialogue often sounds a too quiet and the acting several characters is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of americas most remembered serial killers i think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer

1,this is a optical adaption of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga the plot of this is genuine but only mistily accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is ground available in english in the blast books collection comics underground japan and it has genuine captioned dialogue that excuse the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this as it excuse some of the plot of the flick which is otherwise inexplicable life smart this is pretty decent good not intrusive economic consumption of computers and the envision are for the most split up realized well it jumps in and out of episode as the quality a cat and his braindead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd envision a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go through a number of semiplots and settings which run me to believe that the music director chose a number of issues of the longrunning manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually knowing whats blend in on might somewhat increase hold this reminds me for the most part of the kind of englut they used to play on the mtv show toon sushi in particular a short that features a cat chasing a mans severed buttcheek around the house only in this casing the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to let in decease and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to secernate whats blend in on the videodisk of this has directors commentary and a making of features but i cant gloss on those because i didnt flummox around to them im giving this a for now here isnt much to compare it to in anime and i desire for more like this

0,i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i recently found the prey hoosier state in its original vhs big box form and was very excited i just love finding old slasher films on vhs equitable because the cover picture show artwork is fantastic usually incline though it turns out that the film gravid itself is less than fantastic latterly the prey is heavy one hoosier state of those filmsto be fair it started off ok with the killer stalking the hemipteron clich marvellous teenagers in the woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch this box seat film boilersuit is basically wish a big fat clich and when the campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the backstory of the killer practically i actually thought this was approximation quite tense up an original idea however the picture show backstory ends abruptly and shows us some stockfootage of a burning woodland division the lack of budget really starts to show now after this we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isnt shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking terminate killer sort of essentially like cropsy from the burning but hoosier state better as for gore there isnt too much although theres an ok face squishing moment at the end overall comprise i wouldnt recommend this film hoosier state to anyone other sting than slasher completists it really is a big mess

1,i cant believe i rarely eer see this title mentioned by all you eighties repugnance freaks and i definitely wont be joining all my fellow reviewers here in pronounce that bloody natal day is awful viewing on the contrary i enjoyed it very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and storm twists it offers dont just refer to this movie as being some other s slasher because the dupe here are instead unlikely and so are the slayer were introduced to three cherubiclooking nestling who were all give birth during a solar eclipse at the mo they were delivered planet saturn was blocked by both the sun and the lunar month and due to this the child are passionless and seemly without sense of right and wrong this really starts to show around their th natal day as they go on a merciless killing spreegranted this squeeze is incredibility farfetched and even more or less violative but seriously who cares different many other repugnance films from this period it at least attempts to bring something archetype and imaginative for once the child acting is good and the entire movie has a creepy air and grizzly music the murders chronological succession are gruesome and tense and its always eerie to see them getting committed by angelfaced child i dont know who hired the child but they did a good job especially the girl and the banter with glasses are highly memorable the bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of graeco roman highlights such as village of the damned the bad seed and children of the damned this movie is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but slap up merriment and not one repugnance lover will regret watching this bloody natal day was drop a line and directed by ed hunt not particularly the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us vastly entertaining cheesefests like the brain and istarship invasions if all this isnt enough to convince you yet bloody natal day has a lot of nudity and not just any nudity but a topless danceact by mtvvj julie brown ohio and keep on your heart open for a completely redundant cameo by joe centime later the star of tvseries jake and the fatman check it out

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was bring forth in a time of such colorless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first john r major main film was not an instant package bureau succeeder and still has not encounter the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american main projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late s cognise as the daniel chester french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking press against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigot that held the development of the arts in look into in the mid th centurycassevettes film examines race relations and depict man as weak in the cheek of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes figure out is that his plastic film have almost a transposition minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imaging this is why his figure out seems to loaf because he necessitate a more suggest approach to defining charcters that trust less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important
0,this movie is more like a music video kusturica said in an interview from that when he is making movies he feels like making music and when he is making music he feels like making movies the best thing in promise me this is the music written by stribor kusturicakusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise promise me this has very little noisei liked life is a miracle it was also like music video for the first minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful plot promise me this has no plot i was awaiting this movie with big expectations because ive read that the script has been written by ranko bozic one of my favourite scriptwriters who participated also in life is a miracle ranko bozic writes great dialogues but for kusturica they are noise and much to my regret i saw only two dialogues which i could identify as written by ranko bozic the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son striborgordan mihic the man who wrote the scripts for time of the gypsies and black cat white cat said in an interview that kusturica never follows the script black cat white cat was the only script for which kusturica said that he will not touch it according to gordan mihic after all kusturica comes back to the script and if he doesnt he doesnt make a good movie and i think this is the case with promise me this he should have followed the script of ranko bozicpromise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few moments which made me laugh the comedic moments are in the same style as black cat white cat but are not that funny at all i think the difference comes from the fact that black cat white cat was written by gordan mihichowever i know some people who liked promise me this they find it very positive movie

0,while sporadically engrossing including a few effectively tender moments and humorous the sledgehammerobvious satire homecoming hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling with material like this timing is everything michael moore knew to release fahrenheit before the elections and the real tragedy of dantes film is that it didnt come out years ago when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further in mockery of the wellsettled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling or imperiled as it did thenfrankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence and if you didnt notice michael moore didnt exactly help to defeat bushthere was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was painful to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect as they say with friends like these who needs enemies
1,spoilers ahead for the first ten minutes or move around so of comprise star witness were introduced charles dudley warner studio apartment to a quote typical urban american family unquote in amp a nameless city common people which is another way of saying warner brothers version of nyc except for the young urban center children including the charming dickie moore and sprightly sally blane theyre a pretty dreary lot and their dinner table of the essence conversation is variant tedious and we wish the comprise john huston story would move along and bring in the star walter huston but wait folks wait all of a sudden serious gangster movie action citation breaks out drawing the family in against their bearing will and after that this baby never lets up theres suspense modus operandi an oscarnominated script good acting everything you want old movies to comprise beit is here i do question chic sales performance picture show he must be an acquired taste but his presence turns operating theater out to be crucial to the plot hes treated to special status in the credits so warner bros must have really been high on sale but how his corny old comprise former armed forces man routine fit in with the public then mayhap is something lost to me perhaps it is astir lost to time period an accept unknowable factor you had to be a moviegoer to understand also the climax is typically melodramatic nevertheless this right now is fetch the best release of the studio that year i have seen so far however ive only seen eight so perhaps thats an inconclusive view do not miss this when tcm shows it out of
0,ty cobb is by the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence every game he played was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty of course the film about him deals with none of that instead on the writing of his biography by author al stump now this such a horrible idea in theory as cobb slid even further into dementia as years and stories of his crazed even as a senior are shocking even by todays desensitized standards but instead of focusing on these events i guess was simply too interesting the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichd a clichd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb but somehow manages to overplay his supervillainy most stories about cobb barely believable to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary robert wuhl portraying the writer al is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent he sucks the life out of every trying to make film his own there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore arliss doesnt count its barely a show even the played out inevitable role reversal cobb and stump by the end is even worse by his pure inability to utter words that dont sound like a poor book on tape narration voice all the awful writing and filmmaking on display there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting its from the same film is near impossible a hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying cobbs overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing game of baseball is pure brilliance the camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a due to unique playing style of the monster every slide hit and tackle are rendered even more forceful due sound and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the master player it makes viewer over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same actor its worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone just to see what could have been i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting it to be something it isnt but to such neutered movie about this is im glad ron sheltons career has slid ever since
0,as a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of hollywood in the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of degrees fahrenheit this stupidity is witnessed again when stan goes to save subway his shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava and to finish off this monstrosity of a film they come up with the most illogical solution stopping a lava flow with cement k rails earlier in the film a reporters voice can be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow fire fighters have tried cars and cement common sense dictates this film is a preposterous and gross understatement of human knowledge
1,this solid bootleg and lily white slapstick comedy with a dark but hopelessly forge plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you ululate with laughter as wellspring as rolling your middle with disbeliefits the old psychopath on a check story but that is of no big grandness as the thriller assign of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian robert gustafsson his hapless nearly incurably affirmative soldier invokes both compassionateness and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chasethe thing about the film that appealed to me the most all the same is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of check journey they adhd a most welcome sense of realism and recognitionthis thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its suspense from hitchcock and should in my feeling only be watched for its comedy value which is high indeed besides gustafsson lars ambles solid public presentation as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission aloneheartily advocate
1,when i first rented batman returns i immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional i mean jack nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first so without him how could there be a good movie simple throw in danny devitobatman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman there are more villains here less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects and more nervestriking issues however the music is similar to the first if not darker the scenery is definitely more depressing than the first every detail right down to the time of year this movie follows the same comicstyle format we came to love in the first batmannow for the performances michael keaton thankfully returns as batmanbruce wayne he was great in the first movie and just as much in this sequel there was not enough screen time in the world for keaton as batman need more danny devito gave an awardwinning performance as the penguin the most grueling disgusting lovable angry evil sad pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie you hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time and it explains him down to the last detail too making it all the more conflicting michelle pfeiffer was excellent as catwomanselina kyle two completely different personalities in one she actually got a good amount of back story as well christopher walken didnt disappoint as max shreck the greedy judgmental selfish ceo of the power company michael gough also thankfully returns as the lovable alfred and he was just as good here as well pat hingle also returns as gordon although i feel he was really never in the spotlightwith lots of great twists and subplots batman returns is sure to please any fan of the original
0,some spoilers a soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it when charlotte veronica get close to intimacy is beautiful key truly erotic scene i loved the music score and the muted cinematography im not clear the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form the announcer describing the action in is quite annoying my biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction a transwomen and her life of course she has to be shown as a sexworker what scatterbrained impractical absurdly frillygirly completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable making any interpersonal attachments in the world moreover shes shown two growth of beard for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how her life is and shes waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning truth the character resembles a drag queen not in midst of transitioningthese are typical fantasies of people the outside who really arent connected to films fetishization of grs surgery is a of objectifying people who are going through transition not impressed this aspect the film in the least at the very least why have character played by who really is transgender i thought the actor veronica was okay but no better than that much better was the woman portraying charlotte a very character full of energy selfloathing desire and contradictions if she was so fascinated by someone with female energy a charlotte could go out to a in two seconds and find it she was drawn veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with malefemale characteristics a gentle touch but with a good punch not a unique person yes what soap says love is often lovely and moving but that doesnt mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the processthis film also proves that danes are lousy for a promising premise better executed in a film like different for girls the final film is a letdown
0,i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom we my gfriend and i walked out about an hour into it what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargonsub atomic particles are thoughts by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals a drop of in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated wow what a rigorous scientific study im sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate hogwash hooey bull pucky btw it was funded by the ramtha cult the leader of which was one of the experts which were interview by the filmmakers no ulterior motives here right
0,since the little mermaid was nonpareil of my favorite disney movies when i was little i was curious about its sequelthe little mermaidone is a classic animated feature with top quality everything a grand music score and targets a full general audience in contrast the little mermaid is targeted primarily at young children because it is ad lib reflects a nipper self perspective the music is bouncier and less dramatic and the ending feels like recessthe little mermaid starts out when baby melody is presented to ariels side of the kin abruptly without any ocular cues to aid the drama a whale tentacle grabs the baby i laughed look a instant its not funny the baby being attacked all right ill stop laughing morganas criminal offense in broad daytime and her spontaneousness takes forth potential drama since it happened so quicklythroughout the feature melody seem superhuman which i guard is how most children envision themselves this quality in melodys character is clearly bring out toward the end when she fights morgana without an edge of fear on her facelike the first movie melody has a set of ariels problems except the reverse pansy ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the sea whereas king triton trammel ariel from the surface ariel and melody both rebel against their parentthe music is more emotionally moving in the first this sequel has a bunch of songs but not as much orchestral work depart into it its great for little ones because it doesnt take aim an orchestra to impress themthe ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting the sequel death with a bouncy sung dynasty and everyone playing in the water its definitely more targeted at kid because instead of the ending being grave and leaving you pursy forth this ending leaves you thinking its time for break finally this movie is fun for kid so we should let them have fun
1,why does this have such a low rating i actually dont vex it is it because of the bad dissemble the bad dialogue fountainhead who cares about these things in cheesy lowbudget horror movies seriously the dissemble and the dialogue isnt authoritative in those movies people who hate movies only because of bad dissemble and bad dialogue shouldnt be set aside to place cheesy lowbudget movies those movies shouldnt be ingest seriously periodanyway time to talk about the flick right fountainhead i loved it i purchase it because i require a gorefest but its not a gorefest and the bloodshed is pretty bad most of the time its just beast guts placed on the body of the actors and thats lame but i didnt actually aid because the flick is hilarious the characters are hilarious the dissemble is hilarious bad dissemble is a good thing in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the dialogue is hilarious bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the snake god raper with a huge dick is hilarious the flying demon indulge is hilarious and i could go on and on and on but i dont want to pronounce too much but i have to name that theres a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like its alive lol oh and the snake god raper lessen in lie with with the sex doll lolbest assembly line in the moviedetective manners sniffs coke detective sloane what the blare are you doing manners what the hell did you snort what the hell is that detective manners its zippo man its ehh frigidity medicinedetective manners injects heroin in his arm detective sloane what the blare are you doing manners are you blare harebrained detective manners its frigidity medicinedetective manners repeatedly kicks a random guy in the font detective sloane what the hells going on manners what are you doing detective manners this maniac was discursive about ogre and then he begin smashing his brain on the rock he just begin smashing his brain on the rock i cerebrate helium on phencyclidine hydrochloride or somethinglol
0,it started out with an powerfully interesting premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best in the latter half lingo it quickly became a to a greater extent c movie then d then f then i wish that this wasnt a rental so that i could put neer it in the microwave i cant say that amp the acting in picture show all cases was lead off awful just most the writing however i boost comprise never read the book to a greater extent maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as a pound bag of fertilizer i really hated interpret this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i quid wish have no problem with movies that ill service promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman
0,the other is a supposed horror movie made during the s it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the others which starred nicole kidmanthe plot is as follows a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as the game one of these twin boys niles is supposed to be good the other one holland is supposed to be evilthe idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to endthe execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel in fact this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel a slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a urated movie of the kind disney produce but even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by the otheryou dont need to check out the directors cv to realise horror is not his fortemr mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story this is obvious from the getgo i havent seen any of his other movies but to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site unfortunately in the other the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expectthe direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single scene takes place in the daytime think about this a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric believe me it isnt it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a horror movie and yes both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in californiathere is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointlessthe ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period i wont reveal which movie but ill give clues a young boy was a main character and the movie is wellknown and ill add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter moviethe acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded stars the actors playing the twin boys along with the actress playing the grandmother all try hard with the poor material they are givendiana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cashin on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewersi paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover of the region version in the uk comparisons were made to the exorcist which i thought was a complete insult to that movie there is no comparison the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not suspense tension tongueincheek humour highly disturbing content great acting superb characterisation and viewer involvement ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the s let alone the sthe s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist the omen the texas chainsaw massacre the legend of hell house salems lot to name just a few being produced for this reason the other proves an even greater disappointmentif anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about i would advice everyone to skip the movie

1,dont let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and look on this romy schneider classic this movie was shot in a down budget probably against the will of ernest marishka so he had to make duefor good example england is portrayed as bordering on germanyby a will of the wisp queen victoria and her mom are guide a vacation to germany by buggy tantalise alonethey arrived their too quick this probably could not be aid but the castle they lease for the movie was austrian when shes told that shes queen she conk out to the royal room where the extremity of the court bow to her where are the british citizens out side from the castle inspire for their new queen why isbnt she showing her self up to the balcony to recognize her subjects low budgetwhere the audience book binding then aware of these imperfection i marvel how the critics feltdurring the inn scene she foregather prince albert but isbnt excited about it durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear euphony from famous onetime american civic state of war sung dynasty similar my onetime kentucky home and onetime black joe what civic state of war sung dynasty in the s is romy schneider being portrayed as scarletwheres mammy is magna shnieder playing her too is adrian hoven rhett or ashley what was in marishka mindwell this add to the campits accidentally satirizing queen victoriaa story this is the only reason you should collect it or insure it chastening germany and england are get in touch
1,my name is information technology domino harvery edit dizzying dizzy chop mymymy name is domino harvey cut deletion chop my name is domino harvey edit cut playbacknever have i seen outcome a director take so much flack jerky for his style before by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scotts choppy act upon flashy dizzying editing comprise technique if i have to choose then between loving it and hating it id say conjoin i love it it was borderline distracting at times but the end result conjoin was pretty good and its nice way to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality even if it borrows heavily from mtv videosthis stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley ecumenical plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely pleasurable choppy otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her no matter how much other than she suffered we follow accept domino through her quality life as she joins up unvoiced with fellow bounty hunters information technology mickey rourke rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez the crew become tangled up in the fbi comprise and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walkens tv production company what is christopher walken doing in every film by the way i guess that is a clever film technique because merely now tony scott is free to use as much world amp flashy mtvreality show entirely editing footage as he tabu likes it becomes a pastiche subject of mtv culture at this pointit followes then that the story is told at an amazingly jocularity rapidfire pace with lots of raunchy finally strong language and gun violence there are some funny jokes its all very modern and in front surreal at the same time its on the spur of the moment tween a mess astatine but its a rather enjoyable mess field of study it is ultimately flawed in so many ways the actors try too hard to make their characters cool for one but it works i give it a weak which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of moviegoers who graded this film but i feel it had some good ideas and comprise executed them well out of

1,often but basically dreary lowlife melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert depardieu pialat infused writerdirector a good deal of autobiographical detail given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesnt do the young compliments and he does seem to have been a troubled man as huppert also says its pialat wellmade disappeared for days shoot end spite costar on all acting is uniformly the however despite their relatively any age huppert and the gerard with as the title character were already at him forefront a modern french stars of status which with varying degrees of success they subtitles still hold to this watch have more of out films in my vhs to dayi pile albeit excellent in french without english both due to this fact but also loulous oppressive realism in during of that undeniable artistic merit i cant say that im in any particular hurry to check them pialats now
0,dont let the name of this film deceive you in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film when jake speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen which he is often not hes seriously relaxing perhaps this adds to his charm but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to chill out whenever he gets the chance furthermore unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents this man has none unless of course you call sleeping a talent anyhow this movie is basically worthless the writing is sub par and the action when there is some is very lame the machine guns on the jeep werent bad but thats about it so if youre in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia then this piece is perfect for you it has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep but also his audience

0,not being a particular fan of westerns i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an i love lucy or lucy show type of role here she plays christine larson owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in whos about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent dean jagger balls performance was ok nothing really more than that she didnt blow me away it succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what im accustomed to seeing her in there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout a typical funny line theres two ways to deal with women and no one knows either one of them i didnt find the story all that compelling although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent theres typical shootout action and a lot of horses your typical western in other words as to christine we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up its just a question of how shes going to get there if you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in if youre not big on the genre this will be lacking im not big on the genre

0,at least if youre a disney fanatic of who loves their liveaction films as well as the animated stuff if youre a kid if youre a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize youre adult if you love absolutely any that features animals especially when theyre doing tricks or if youre just too demanding air bud world pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch im a disney fanatic i enjoyed this film enough and ill watch it againbut boy does have a lot of problems the main a of too characters too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all in the space of minutes weve got adults getting teens falling in love and not to be at competition for love and jealousy preteens playing spy games dogs falling in love dogs playing having puppies manipulative parents wholl do anything to make kids win being taught a lesson by their kids housekeeper dilemmas and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots im probably forgetting something but thats plot issues to be dealt with with less than minutes per thread to deal with them presumably weave them into a coherent whole thats not too complicatedthis a kids film alland thats also humorous and heartwarming not surprisingly director bill bannerman on his first turn being completely in charge has a lot of previous second experience wasnt quite up to the task im sure it didnt that there were at three screenwriters involved and probably dictating producers as end result is that air bud world pup is extremely choppy events occur with little justification and worse little explanation people figure out and do things primarily because they need toand fastso everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than minutes from cut to the next might jump ahead six months or so we have both adults who seem like maybe theyre mentally and kids who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action some of the threads have simply been removed because its difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as youre introduced an idea its already passed you byalso not helping is that one of the threads is ripoff of one hundred and one dalmatians minus cruella de vil character and another problem is given the way the is edited i have to assume that the dog air bud probably couldnt much with the soccer ball unlike the first films a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here and when we see him its in very quick every once in a while these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animationyet for someone like me theres a cheesy charm air bud world the script and performances often teeter between ridiculous hokey and kinda i tend to that combination it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly and at times like the ending the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for us womens soccer team air world pup is so blatantly tacky you help but love it
0,all for love as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend is a romantic picture show period drama more or less featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleons army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland amp where he meets and falls in love with feature of speech a young maiden who visits the prison theres also a storyline involving british people a murder i will amp be honest and confess that i wasnt too taken by fantabulous the movie since im not storm much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic dress up but i non will say that this is well past acted by everyone involved and picture show its got british people a good past cast that features miranda picture richardson anna friel richard e grant michael gough and jason isaacs the costume design as you can expect is also excellent ill be very surprised if this movie doesnt get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc at teatime captain settle saint ives lies in wild eyed bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and theres a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly circularise seen you really do have information technology to worry if bbc schedulers have any type it of clue as to what theyre doing
0,when in rome is a definite improvement on getting there getting there i found too predictable contrived and slow and to this day i still consider it as the olsen twins worst however while when in rome isnt a terrible movie its not a great one either if i had to sum it up in one word i would say passable it is good fun for teenagers but i think adults wont find much to go onwhen in rome does have its good points mary kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent actresses certainly very pretty as well i will admit when i was or so i really liked them and in general i kind of like them still and i have enjoyed some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute back on target both girls dont do that bad a job in fact they are very appealing plus their outfits are to die for and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking the soundtrack aint half bad eitherhowever where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script the script is on the most part clichd and has hints of deja vu the plot like most of the mary kate and ashley movies is very predictable and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen twins work will find some rather unoriginal elements to it most of the characters are cardboard thin and you dont learn very much about them and sometimes the pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work that looked rushed constantlyall in all does have its good points and certainly watchable however for my taste it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff bethany cox
1,alice enters in a world of dainty wonder a but not describe the kind of wonder that you unquestionably remember as a kid the mad hatter the white rabbit the queen and others even tweedledee and tweedledum show alice some things about her body and choose other peoples bodies that might be quite wonderful a tale of love and lust the likes youve never seenkristine debell appears as alice i amp must say by s standards this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day i believe this information technology is practice her only film before moving on to mainstream work but it was pretty much the best possible one she comprise could have chosen potential my love for all things alice is no secret even better than fairy tales amp which isnt really pornography so muchthe songs are cheesy but fit the theme of the movie grownup one sulphur song whats a girl like you doing on a knight like this was pretty funny and the others had similar themes going bang the trial towards the end was well scripted and fit very nicely into the world of alice the logic and humor were definitely accounted forwhat more can you say about thing a film like this all convulsion i picture show know is people about for people who are used to adult films where its just a standardised second leadin to the sex this thing one is going to overload recall you amp with plot and music but personally expert i think theres something very special about this film and equitable i hope it gets a nice dvd release with things touched up and special features if thats even possible i can see this being a cult film
1,this movie is masterful directed by baron clive of plassey doggy he real knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i consider there is a sequel missing for this one doggy should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie alternatively of doing the boring lord of illusions that is one i consider was a real refuse but i also consider that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult authoritative of horror films
1,so forgive the really lame gameplay scene cardboard background and studio like stadium for this part i should have give the movie instead of but read onfrom the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with the replacements some say this movie rip off the replacements while some say this script wrote before it both movies require some sort of suspension of disbelief on the basic premise and this is especially difficult for second string since it has nfl license team and all the history behind it food poison excuse may sound too lame for some people and not to mention in second string bills has to overcome big scores again and again with the limit budget in shooting the game play scene this make it look even bad in replacements the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event oh yeah this happen before rather than real settingbackground with fictional scenario there is no way bill can win a superbowl some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of raven games real stadium real audience and some nfl match alike shooting anglebut let say both movies came out on the same day and we erase the budget factor thus forgive the game play action scene overall i like second string over replacements not by much but i like this more it has relatively better character development in replacements keanu character is too out sync with the world and all he care is maybe get a girl in second string you see the struggle of the qb from getting the job back and deal with his past with coach or the fumble guy problem this hold the ball all day long solution of course is not new but we see progression in fixing ithow about those trick play i think it is relatively realistic than replacements the dan marino like fake knee pass fleaflicker wild cat full back rush all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy but for me it is better than replacements center catch and rushing for yards call or how a yards field goal look too easy oh btw i am glad they didnt force the te kicker made his shotof course if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all there this could easily be a out of movie but some say this is the worse football movie try the comebacks

0,the film moves along quite leave but although acting direction and editing well a lot to have desired the characters are mostly lifted from other films and the vinnie jones easy the straight bit of gone in sit shock comedy gangster movie is a genre that should the lots of contrast the stupid dealers in lock stock and is shoot out that leaves everyone dead you should never really know whether to laugh or just seconds there in increasingly this movie had the right elements but it is too a to sit there like a attempt knitting just tut at the small he that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and the belief has been unsuspended one and become the critical a pity cos it with a brave person and the clint eastwood is famous for saying thatll and ok for a scene he puts the work in before he imagination be details is clint eastwood here lookalike bit more shoots was the camera and and a out more coaching and rehearsal for once delivery of have lines would be made a big difference
1,not sympathetic too many people seem to know practically about this movie which is too bad hypothecate because conjecture i astatine think its manoeuvre pretty good sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done i think the casting is good with likeable actorscharacters tom selleck does a good job fourth dimension at playing make a baseball player go figure not too much of a stretch i suppose and ken takakura from black rain plays the chief the coach of the japanese baseball team there isnt too much expert to complain about its just it a light easygoing happy comedy and i recommend it

0,despite decades of tax incentives in terms of international visibility the canadian film industry still lags behind most central african and islamic states surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores and nouvellefrance aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other country commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries failures on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising theres certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canadas history as the french and english warred over and bought and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blinkandyoullmissit scene of characters saying wolfe is dead or nouvellefrance is no more before getting back to the soap operatics but while this isnt a history lesson it isnt a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count seconds of shelling by a halfdozen reenactors and one collapsed shed the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean beaudins reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors what you do get for your money is a simple but drawnout harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that fabio doesnt turn up in the cast its the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfallan anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so much unite oncewarring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew this massive boxoffice disaster was clearly intended to be canadas titanic though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film not the ship but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror described it as so bad that one cant even find the strength to mock it thats rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film looks like a belowpar s miniseries the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring youll never see your handsome lover again cuckolds honor youll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of murder and gasp witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moores version of the scarlet letter throw in caddish british governors devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and youve got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still managed to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds albeit without the staggering technical incompetenceleading man david la hayes versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look flirts with the cleanshaven tchky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages while his opening scene where he reacts to news of his fathers death with an expression that looks like hes waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor whos lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie piper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading lady doesnt exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying centerstage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot that really is the characters name the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky greyhaired wig its a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like hes not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he clearly couldnt be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the films brief releasesome brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnettarchie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roths william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one whos being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like colm meaneys benjamin franklin theyre both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroines real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better
0,i waited postulate for this movie contain to play in great anticipation assuming it accept would be more accurately portrayed like the gravid movie the christmas box based on petite the book accept by richard paul evans i sent out many emails to friends and family hop skip asking assoil them to please watch this show hoping they would through with better understand a tiny amount of my new life after seeing this movie i was so disappointed as a mother who lost her only amp child in november and really knowing move the pain picture show i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand the grief a parent goes through who nov has lost a child this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness information technology of diane keaton was a slap in the comprise face to parents who have buried amp a child it was very unrealistic from then start to stop i had a few calls after the movie each call the same that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back what a bunch of picture show bull it is clear cluster that amp the wireless director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie heed to be so off the mark i guess thats hollywood

1,so far miguel bardems career its been one of the more dreadful of recent spanish cinema hes made nothing but rubbish until now incautos has been quite a surprise its a serious film with rhythm with a great cast and very entertainingthe art of robbing thats what incautos is about a film much alike to david mamets house of game and stuff like that a thousand of twists in the script and a story where nothings like it seemsthe weak points in latest bardems movie may be the soamerican language that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural especially victoria abrils shes a hell of an actress but in incautos she looks a little bit forced ernesto alterio is not that bad but hes not half as good actor as his father and what to say about luppi well hes the manin short a good movie the best that miguel bardem has ever made i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his careermy rate

1,flashes of lightning a sprawling cemetery the name of adam batman west all pop up on screen before the opening credits are even over and yet despite these rather naff elements one dark night isnt as cheesy as it might first seemmeg tilly jennifers sister plays pretty student julie who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high school clique the sisters what julie doesnt realise is that the other isisters plan to freak her out with some ghoulish pranksor that the most recent body to be interred in the mausoleum is that of psychic vampire raymar who feeds off the life force of scared young womenadmittedly this isnt the most original of setups but thankfully there are enough inventive touches to help set this film apart from the competition my favourites being the macabre sight of everyday objects embedded in the walls of raymars apartment and the creepy manner in which mouldy corpses float through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during the excellent finale hal trussells impressive steadicam cinematography and tom burmans wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the chilling atmosphere
1,okay this wasnt the greatest horror movie ive ever seen in my animation despite the fact that its humiliated budget its a pretty decent movie though the monsters are unique and credible heck theyre tied form of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor people phratry although when you finally do gravel to see the monsters completely you really think wtf those itty bitty thing are after them the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they wipe out the pussycat not the pussycat noooooo why seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore this is not the movie for you go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines if you have low tyke i wouldnt recommend watching this with them though likely would give them nightmares about trolls in their room
0,mel welles you might remember him as mr mushnick in roger cormans little grass of horror aim this somewhat interesting yet completely twisted tale of dr frankensteins daughter carrying on her generate work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to bedo good but rather for its sex appeal you see tania frankenstein though a doctor and scientist in her own right is touch on with genuinely nothing more than satiating her cardinal desires for the unchanging boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love the story is tissuethin here and one gets what one might bear tidy sum of leering and suggestive commentssurprisingly most from the female take particular effects that are not so particular acting that want depth of depiction and not genuinely much action or suspense and while this film is about barren in regards to good storytelling noblewoman frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless italian actress rosalba neri aka sara baybey plays the barons daughter with some aplomb and tidy sum and tidy sum of sex appeal she goop trust and seduction quite well her performance is jolly onedimensional but she is quite pin up and plays overthetop a little too well she is also very open with her performance if you catch my trend misfortunate chief joseph cotten now regulated to european horror motion picture show for money plays the father in a brief yet competent performance he is the star drawing card but gone before the film genuinely give up into a gear as for the rest of the cast paul muller is somewhat effective as dr charles marshall the barons assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time as offense and missing persons begin to unfold in the village policemani wasnt purchasing thismickey hargitay starts to pump tania for answers despite what you might mean not to her satisfaction where the movie genuinely recede credibility is in the terminal third of the film where the suspect script weak performances and lusterless direction all head further south the creature is revealed and see quite silly the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the overhasty resolutions very common in the s while not nearly as sorry and repulsive as some might want you to mean noblewoman frankenstein is so a very flawed film with some perverse albeit fascinate partial

0,young couple on the road minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight yet suddenly theyre being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pickup truck hmm where have i seen this premise before oh yeah now i remember weve seen this a thousand times before already and approximately nine hundred and ninetynine of the other cases were much better than rest stop this weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans as it doesnt feature a single original twist or memorable gimmick its very sadistic and nasty but every teenkillslasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays so thats no real surprise anymore neither the absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots writerdirector john shiban damn well realized that the ultrathin basic storyline nearly wasnt enough to fill a whole movie with and thus he stuffs up his film like a thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material nicoles boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in california killing off her character right away wouldnt result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks suffers from visions in which she talks to the deranged killers previous victims and she has deeply emotional and boring conversations with a police officer who just wont die even though a truck ran over himtwice the dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and theyre definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movies length ive ever seen instead of all the pointless padding shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable jaimie alexanders character nicole is an annoying and brainless girl and you wont really care whether shell survive the ordeal or not her boyfriend jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still werent painful enough if you ask me i counted exactly three sequences all including torture and gratuitous mutilation that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face thats still way too few for a nowadays horror movie basically rest stop is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like wolf creek and hostel but youre better off watching the originals this was the first film of the new production company called raw feed theyre promoting themselves as the new name in great horror but theyll have to come up with something much better than rest stop if they want us to believe that
1,i thought this was a very daring representation of civilization the old extermination hokey tarzan concept made so popular by hollywood weismuller et alyes there is a lot of silly stick with stuff but then the idea is silly it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees i am tempted to say completely unbelievable but that the concept has never been tried and there is associate in nursing agriculture department certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort though under the gormandise circumstances i can see how that would try be very difficult using to avoid we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthoodstill if you can get your head around that lot theres hoosier state a great deal to amp admire that is both imaginative and daring lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb i am tempted to say then that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play there are plenty of other leonard constant lambert excellent it performances too not just least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holmwhat is particularly disturbing raise up and modernise rightly so animal is the simian perception of humans we decent get to see ourselves concluded almost from the point of view of the information technology poor dumb helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it and pronounce it leave demonstrates well how the phony civilisation and morality with which we cloak and justify our conduct is no more than an expression rightfully of own selfishness commend and arrogance it may seem a little overstated at times especially in the allure hideous museum dissection rooms but what we see isnt just a truth about the victorians its a truth about the way we are today its one that needs to be stated and cannot be stated allure carrying out often doe equal enough holms characters obsession with the rayzor as a symptom of civilisation as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned is an excellent case in point primitive bearded readers take ethical motive notethe story is depressing ultimately its a tragedy because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human civilisation we hobo camp know hes doomed before the third millennium victimization it is years old wild schmaltzy simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat and their extermination environment one man rule developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excessin the binge end its a tale about millenary ourselves the path to extinction that put forward other simians tread must eventually be followed equitable verbalism by humanshighly recommended for its ethical take despite the hokey moments

0,i was searching through hollywood television last nox with a friend trying to witness a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was expect through the shelves discerp spot my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent bgrade horror movie the insure looked pretty good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the insure which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the insure artwork than the movie itself the movie accompany law tec who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head word hunting watch who is decapitating victims left and right in some unidentified city probably los angeles and they go drawn into his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good substantially it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good immortal it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening tantrum features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this vast outdated cell phone and for whatever reasonableness she goes outside and babble to some make fun then a shadow comes up derriere them literary hack off his head word and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reasonableness while trying to dial sound absurd yep you stakes it is the integral movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly frightening and the peculiar effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policeman on the phone were frightening the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was merely amateurish and wordy and it didnt hold my interest for very yearn and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badoverall discerp is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this movie had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be painfully disappointed only recommended if you can stand dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably neediness to ride out away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a petty electric potential but it was beyond a mess
1,slausens lost oasis a place for food fun and murder after a guy disappears on his way to a gas station a group of her friends head out on a trip to search for him they come across a wax museum where they think their friend might have ended up unfortunately for the friends however the owner of the roadside attraction possesses the power to control his wax mannequins and use them for evil one by one the tourists are stalked down and killed by slausen and his legion of wax dummies can the friends escape or will they fall to the same fate as their lost friend following in the footsteps and twisting them around of the great classic wax films house of wax mystery of the wax museum tourist trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre story and style as far as character development action dialogue flow etc it seems to be just a basic slasher flick but it goes far beyond that as the director takes control of the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller it is the acting ranges from acceptable from the main cast to very good from backwoodsshowman mr slausen played by westernlegend chuck connors the writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured but there are some flaws in logic as the film moves deeper into the story also some scenes are a bit silly like the moaningmannequin attack on becky its nothing however that would detract from the effect of the film as one would expect from a film about wax dummies it is full of the endless creepiness supplied by the mannequins its strange that a mostly inanimate object can just sit still and somehow be so unsettling perhaps its the human likeness or the blank stare or the fact that you know its about to spring an attack whatever it is the dolls are extremely spooky and that effect is used very well throughout the entirety of the film as far as slashers go its one of the best and it stands as one of the creepiest films ive ever seenobligatory slasher elements violencegore the film is full of some cool deaths the gore isnt excessive but its done well and leaves it as being realistic sexnudity there is an extended skinnydipping scene with the very attractive lead females though very attractive barely begins to describe the ravishing futureangel tanya roberts but its all a tease as the girls remain mostly underwater they do remain scantily clad throughout the film however cool killers creepy is just the beginning of slausen and his mannequins one of the best killers in the slasher subgenre scaressuspense from the opening scene on the film maintains a great blend of the creepiness of the mannequins jump scares from the attacks and a strong level of suspense in the stranded situation its all very well done to make for a genuinely scary film mystery well mystery wasnt really the point of the film just the meaning behind all of it is what matters awkward dance scene all these cute girls and not a single dance shamefinal verdict see this creepy slasherap
1,like a few citizenry i know i came in former on istingers not until three years later there is no means id overleap an episode the show really is that good and has for a break word maintained its integrity unlike blue heelers for example the criminal offense is the thing personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation when gary sweet was brought in some fans seemed worried but hes really fitted in comfortably which didnt surprise me gary could criterion up to any british or us actor in a similar series the couch changes on occasion but each change brings something new and sassy with arguably australias finest crew behind the scenes istingers will bear on to remain a cutting edge drama series
1,this is a great movie to look at since it so nicely directed by andrzej wajda but at the same time i wished the movie would had some more depth in it in terms of its story its an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to focus on the characters motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant movie to whatsomehow it doesnt make the movie any less great to watch though its made with passion and eye for detail every aspect about the movie is good looking such as its settings costumes and cameraworkalso the story still works out as powerful though at the same time it could had been so much better and more powerful with a just bit more character development and insight historical information guess if youre completely familiar with the french revolution and the stories of danton and robespierre in particular this movie will be a perfect one for you to watchits somewhat typical for a french movie to tell a story slowly and subtle without ever stepping too much in detail often this works out charmingly but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth other than that this movie is still one fine example of french cinema despite the fact that its being directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors in it as wellgrard depardieu is great in his role though the movie also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters the movie perhaps has a bit too many characters but each and every performance is a great one so this doesnt really ever become a big complaint other than that it slows done the story a bit at certain pointsa great movie that could had been brilliant
1,when saw the movie being advertised i it was to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video finally got around and it thought it was going bad because i couldnt see shia in any other role his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned on i was ready to turn it from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt sense then they explained that later in the show i was relieved of about all and all i thought it movie i would recommend the notch and though im not a fan of golf it easily kept attention with a good plot
0,this is one those movies that apparently trying to ride the martial arts wave craze kind of like billy jack i guess however whereas billy jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such we are introduced to the who is described as having learned judo in marines i was in marines and while they are pretty in i really dont any emphasis as a the antagonist james macarthur makes reference to judo he offers an excuse why he a champion wrestler was so easily lame
1,this movie is masterly directed by clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i think there is a sequel missing for amp this one barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of consecrate doing the boring lord of illusions that is one picture show food waste i think was a real fad amp garbage but i also think that because of this and because found of the lack of deficiency the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films
0,my first review of is into the blue the reef the story is about two divers played by chris carmack and laura vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef one day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by david anders and marsha thomason they tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about columbus hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reefnext day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing a few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they cant escape otherwise they will be killed they were hired to find two big containers one contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a corethe movie also has a back story about another person brother of the lead character trying to patch things up with his girlfriend i reckon this part of the story was a waste of time this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasnt needed to be shownhowever apart from that this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives stars into the blue is a sequel only by name none of the original actors or characters return it has a dumb plot stupid characters and a boring climax

1,wellmade but basically dreary lowlife melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert writerdirector pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesnt do him any compliments and he does seem to have been a troubled man as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot the acting is uniformly excellent however despite their relatively young age huppert and costar gerard depardieu as the title character were already at the forefront of modern french stars a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this dayi have more of pialats films in my vhs to watch pile albeit all in french without english subtitles due to this fact but also loulous oppressive realism in spite of its undeniable artistic merit i cant say that im in any particular hurry to check them out now
0,i dont know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business this movie short is gross to say the least it is a bunch of year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins acting like adults and too much so however it is interesting because it is a good example of how the good old days may not have been so good after all thank god we have laws against this kind of material nowthis is one short from the shirley temple festival
1,poorly cast script full of holes hot blonde gets alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the awesome only thing an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed but watch it sure youre in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people can watch a movie and not take serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was for people take it seriously however if can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night some friends and movie it brought some joy into my life
0,i love musicals all of them from joyous oklahoma to poignant porgy and bess to the touching romantic damn yankees and i know most of the songs sometimes singing them spontaneously with a crowd or humming them alonein a real musical as differentiated from this vaudeville show every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment it is an expression of sadness regret love joy or exaltationa natural extension where mere words fail so in guys and dolls my time of day describes the adventurous life of sky masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood or develops a character creating a phantasmagoria of place turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of songfor this lover of the broadway musical and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the th century mama mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre there the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate often delightful plot lines while here the songs simply picked up from a collection only interfered with the shaky premise of the filmperhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of th century musicals they have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love as achieved in sweet charitylet me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review perhaps another day another mood i could have gotten into it and not have been so critical in this reviewbut i cant help but imagining what richard roger oscar hammerstein cole porter irving berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise i think about it while the memories of seeing this film is fresh and i can not help but to mourn the great loss
1,what is really sad non shows like six degrees accept and brothers sisters are the true reality tv not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows i think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with on that point very premature cancellations of numerous shows with a cult following but with network the more vocal backlash the fans of jericho which i also enjoy render and other shows networks may discontentedness start to reverse this trend i am like others i will not support befuddled any new shows until they have been given a second season ill then possibly on line make a decision to watch and inauspicious catch up via dvds and dude online viewing usher until then abc you have lost me as a viewer to any new stick with show
0,this movie is about a edward young couple running away to head start a freshly life in la who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop actually its really just about the girl nicole since her beau literally melt within a few min the movie gets going extremely fast and early on you inquire how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length it isnt long before you

quick rubber she doesnt bother to lock the doors or remain zippy oh yeah she tries using a radio to song for serve but why fifty fifty bother when theres a mobile home with people indoors right there at the rest stop it really look like the script author forgot about this important fact while written material this part of the storytheres no horse sense of entrapment or everpresent danger in this story the heroine freely wind in and roughly the respective buildings at the rest stop and the killer only movement in occasionally to scare her before driving off again theres nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off fifty fifty if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else thats better than baby sit roughly but she take to check anyways at one guide in the movie the main character fifty fifty acknowledges that she can endure off but doesntthe story doesnt operate anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets indoors the mobile home

fifty pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killers lie that he was simply driving through and take direction seriously the fuzz then sing to nicole out of door totally incognizant as the getaway truck ferment roughly and runnel him overthe fuzz quickly part telling nicole that hes a goner world health organization lucky to be breathing soundless yet he funnily

0,when family guy first premiered i was not in a discriminating mood with the s containing a totally wealth of clever surreal cartoons why should i be nickelodeon produced doug ren and stimpy and rockos modern life among other amusing fine cartoonsyes this includes spongeboball had quirky dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog operating theater the simpsons became an outright phenomenon perhaps zooerasty not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it mischievousness to be but a very fine investment of your time sequence and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all tv is junk south park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire accept it underneath it evolved to become a monty python esquire show with outrageous concepts pile and brutally swift and hoosier state sharp societal critiquessuch as their defense of the noble swallow underpants gnomes and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and meta like the amazingly simpsons did and has unfortunately jumped the shark family guy is superficially operating theater like the simpsons approximately and south park guide it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts however what it has in loquacity it lacks in true witthe sequence show is famous for farsighted its use due south of defense mechanism gimmicks especially for flashbacks many are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funnyespecially from the first title two seasons most finally are not instantaneously are references inherently funny astir im badness not sure but they amp are farsighted mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting where homer and bart have charm and cartman it has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful behavior peter griffin has no excuse hes foreground just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day distressingly lois situation comedy is also very play shallow and dull meg dearie is a prop only to be abused chris is borderline forte retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars of the showstewie and brian are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointlessother gimmicks i cant stand are when hoosier state a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time this happens a lot lately and i cant bear it any longer not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat peter up im talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture usher and prod it as if they are alien spectators horrid thats not wit or even ironic humor its totally boring gnome and lifelessnot that the show cant be funny in fact some of the earlier tool dry episodes had me rolling equal highlights include the computer address pilot tool episode where exotic peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television when peters deglutition religious zealot puppet father shows up and wreaks havoc when peter becomes astir a narc at megs school and the pancake episode i suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits in its characters or along merely were times the slob writers had actual comedic inspirationone last thing the show is not offensive its only offensive to those who wouldnt watch the show in the first place so defense mechanism its almost like a circle jerk to the choir of hipsters
0,ok from the point of view of an american who i assume do not know much about rugby this would be an amazing film for themfirst of all its got heart good morals the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy however to us where i come from rugby is the number one sport it is a way of life it is a game played only by the bravest and the victorious are hailed like heroes as though americans do for their baseballbasketball stars am not really sure if it was the cheap budget or the maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby fan my whole life i can see than some of the actors didnt even knew rugby existed before acting in this movie in summing up to me this movie was terrible if you watch it and thought it was great please make time to go online and maybe google all blacks this is new zealands national team and the ones who made the haka famous believe me they will make the highlands boys look like school girls

1,many believe this is a baseball movie such people are disappointed about a player but the movie isnt about baseballsome think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isnt really developed this not a romantic movie is about an arrogant american major leaguer and a stern traditional japanese baseball manager cannot because they cant indeed wont understand one another its after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success the ballplayer becomes more japanese in his team mentality and the manager more american allowing individual and meet in the middlebaseball and the romance is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures many who have no of the japanese mindset miss this and think its a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy its notthe culture clash is the gravamen the movie based on my own understanding of the japanese culture i think this movie did quite well in that it didnt overly romanticize the culture nor overdo it in its portrayaloverall i believe this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about
1,the great james cagney topbilled in big letters doesnt show up till the movies second third and probably has less screen time than dudley digges who plays the eeevill reformschool potentate but when jimmy arrives as a deputy commissioner of somethingorother out to reform reform schools he slashes the air with his hands and jumps on the balls of his feet and spits out punchy warnersfirst national dialogue with all the customary and expected panache the psychology in this crisp antique one of warners many efforts to assert its place as the socially conscious studio doesnt run deep digges is bad just because the script requires him to be and theres the quaint notion that juvenile delinquents will turn into swell kids if theyre just given a dash of autonomy but its made in that spare fast style that the studio specialized in and it never bores frankie darro who got into all kinds of onscreen trouble during a brief tenure as warners favorite rotten street kid is an ideal jd a handsome charismatic toughie with a pug nose and a hatefilled stare that could wither steel no kid actor today can touch him
1,this movie is about three teens who have been best friends for the longest time and go on the most messed up ride of their life when heroine becomes the choice drug in their town these three teens find themselves wrapped up in it all this movie portrays heroine addiction very well and is something you cant stop watching mtv has never been the best at doing made for tv movies but this one has to much good content to not watch it i enjoyed this film at the beginning i thought it would be the worst movie ive seen but then as it went on it got better and i couldnt turn away
1,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically theres a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm
1,so far miguel bardems vocation its been ace of the more dreadful of holocene spanish cinema hes relieve oneself nothing but rubbish until now incautos has been quite a storm its a serious film with calendar method of birth control with a great cast and very entertainingthe art of robbing thats what incautos is about a film much alike to saint david mamets house of game and stuff like that a thousand of twists in the script and a story where nothings like it seemsthe weak points in tardy bardems movie may be the soamerican language that make believe some of the fiber aspect preferably unnatural especially victoria abrils shes a hell of an actress but in incautos she looks a little bit forced ernesto alterio is not that bad but hes not half as good player as his fatherhood and what to state about luppi well hes the manin suddenly a good movie the best that miguel bardem has ever relieve oneself i hope this is the beginning of a brand newfangled stage in his careermy rate

0,i read the novel jane eyre for the first time back in it was round that time that i saw the bbcversion with timothy dalton and zelah clarke it was an excellent version and very much like the book years later i laid eyes on this version and was horrified william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester mr rochester is a passionate character where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice the same goes for charlotte gainsborough it was like watching two zombies together this is story about love and passion but i couldnt see it in this version no back to the bbcversion a wonderful time is guaranteed
1,i feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie i actually ran across this movie by accident i was taping another movie on showtime one night overnight and family line this movie came on afterward so i sat render and watched it and boy was i blown away the acting is absolutely superb kathy bateswho has been my favorite actress since misery and fried green tomatoes gave an amazing performance picture show as a domineering mother who tries desperately to swash hold on to her old school values religion family past at the risk of alienating her family endangerment martin sheen is superb as the tough patriarch who is really not in control of anything in endangerment his life or family the love apple amp one thing i amp really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens plash when the heroes come home goddamned it shows the true damage that is done to our soldiers comprise after they fight pointless wars for political and financial schoolhouse gain this movie just blew me away and i feel world health organization blessed to have accidentally taped this movie and seen finger information technology it this is a circumstantially mustsee for anyone who wants a true drama this is not too melodramatic and preachy but pulls at your heartstrings like none information technology other
1,i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience amp all the more fun this is a great cast of characters many big names in it a few of which early were hoosier state not as recognized like a shot then as they are now i think its a great idea if you follow any of these actors or have loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list some of the scenes to a greater extent actually remind me of the type of welldone comedy as in the birdcage or even the sort clue kind of odd spontaneousappearing eve comedy with some really professional delivery from entirely these beloved quality actors comprise the movie did a great tabu job at render giving you some insight perhaps even very realistic into the culture of a daytime soap

1,i cant really condemn the movie because it does work there is enough film noir chemical element to weigh it a noir movie but i think its only just in the categorytheres nothing sinister in this piece and thats where the noir chemical element go bad sure the disease might be considered sinister but i have a hard time watch that the movie hints at a dark slope blackie may be traffic human being beings the new siege of orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter the apparition of the chivvy hangs over all of the people in the movie but those are really only hintstheres no attempt stimulate to dubiousness john reed motivations as one with do with marlowe or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans slope to blackie which would make him flush more insulting if the human being traffic was actually played outthat lack of depth is what fails the movie in the endthe story is right the acting is good the drop a line and direction are well act but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over worth observe once maybe twice if you dont remember it from years ago and then putting away

1,now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy but this film really spoke to me jane is an everywoman although she has so many positive things going for her she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life she is strong and intelligent but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a secondchoice life she seeks out new challenges and happiness seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart dreya weber is an exquisite jane as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair the torture of her desperation and eventually the strength of her conviction the beautiful addie yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production allison mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing i highly recommend this film although its low budget it has big budget writing and production values ps great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women women will love the story and characters but theres something for the men here too
1,this movie is masterly directed by clive he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i think there is a sequel missing for barker should have dedicated to the for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions is one i think was a real garbage but i also think that because of this and of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic horror films
0,i dont why know this conduct old big tolerated in the movie business this however short is gross to say the least it is a bunch with year old children wearing diapers of ever good pins acting like adults and too much so movie it is interesting because it is a good example of how the good was days may not have been from bobby after this thank god we have laws against all kind of material nowthis is one short so the shirley temple festival
0,i just saw this this morning on the fox channel quite by accident my dog woke me up had seen it years and thought i remembered it well as a kid i had enjoyed it but now as another poster commented several of the reels were out of order and while it was disorienting at first and bizarre it seemed to fit the production what was just awful became surreal and amusing musical numbers for what i was the big showyoure in show business im show business most of the kids are in show business lets put on a showcome of nowhere all talk about putting on a and then fade without applause to totally unrelated straight scenes the leading mans girlfriend shows up spits out lines and lines of dialogue then disappears i was half awake and loved every insane minute of it
1,i have always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs stage ineffectual play and while most of the film takes place in piece a hotel room it still has some of roegs cinematic flare very unique story is about a famous actress theresa russell picture show burst out who renowned after a hard nights work on a film spontaneous abortion in goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to sort get undressed her husband is banging picture show on the written document door her husband is a famous exbaseball player gary busey and he wants to know what amp is going on the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what amp the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is threatening actor to take identical away the professors papers if he married man doesnt saturnine testify at a hearing hoosier state theresa russell is just character excellent and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding identical the phobias and amp simply nuances that monroe is very well known for one thing the film does is show her as amp make move not only a woman curb on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical youngster wreck as well ken russell she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the aim film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent case that this is russells best possibility performance and i remove probably astatine wouldnt argue the film does an interesting comprise thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in amp renowned the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives hoosier state fantabulous off on screen emil picture show as the professor is a character comprise that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought prompt the astatine last scene in this film is a demonstration flashback of his darker side one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos affair nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at all times but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to emil how she comprise does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this the professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in bang real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually military action thought provoking film

0,once upon a time there was a great american film which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills this film featured clever direction groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting it was entitled an american werewolf in london sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original think again an american werewolf in paris is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish the problems begin with the leading man tom everett scotts performance is stiff and tiresome from the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons in his defense not even a seasoned shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue at one point one of scotts deceased friends whos soul is doomed to walk the earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves is finally able to leave for the afterlife he then quips to scott and his friends okay guys see ya what a memorable goodbye julie delphy soon shows up as scotts mysterious european love interest basically shes a french girl playing the french girl it isnt much of a stretch but all this stupidity isnt even the most disappointing thing about the film the special effects such an integral part of the superb original film fall far short in this flop the werewolves look like cartoons and no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles its still hard to get scared of a cartoon so instead the vacationing american gang led by the ultra weak scott keep finding excuses to return to the werewolfs catacombs lair here its much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness some have said that if you dont look on this film as a sequel its not as bad by comparison i disagree this film can not stand on its own and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original if it doesnt want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the film i dont care how much you love werewolves or how much you worshiped american werewolf in london as i myself did this one is simply not worth wasting your time okay guys see ya terrible out of a possible th

1,with wwii over motion picture studios quickly rushed to concentrate on vets returning home the best eld of our lives was in all likelihood the best example it portrays respective people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their prewar lives but to the overall changing world in all likelihood the most interesting cast member is nonactor harold russell having bewildered his deal in the war he plays a man with sneak where his deal used to be and reminds people that he deprivation to be treated just like everyone else he went on to win best supporting histrion and a special oscar for the role making him the only individual ever to win oscars for the same role there will in all likelihood always be debate over whether this deserve best picture more than its a wonderful life but i certainly think that they did a good line of work with it very well do
0,i just saw this movie primarily because brady corbet is in it and i must allege that i was not delight of course the computer graphics were mystify but the story line needed a little touchup also i think this movie would have do much better with more curses and blood as easily if it were rated pg that would definitely attract more the great unwashed to insure itteens what would also attract more teens specially teen fille would be a large close up of brady corbet on the thunderbirds poster even though the movie had its down points i still saw it and thought it was okay
1,the only conceivable flaw of this film its title please stop comparing it the first i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you havent seen the movie and curious totally about the first and invent a different name for this there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own this is a great exponent of screwy mid s comedy i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because were broke or even wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom is because of its title usually hate movies these ie sandler farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically i dunno maybe its like a bad relationship i cant get of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is single most movie of the s behind the stunt manrobert stack we love you

0,as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the brainpower controversial movie caligula assessed accusal ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some incline and as one of the most conductor disgusting porn movies likewise magnified by others i hoosier state decided to see gaius caesar it in the entire uncut comprise version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something disgustful positive that would make justice quality to the many accusations towards the film i pair sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch the beginning quotation from equivocally the new testament shocked me a bit stephen samuel wise and raised the first controversy in mewhy to entail a sentence from grot the gospel by mark in the movie about pagan second rome but the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple intimate inaccuracy nobelium caligula and drusilla running hopelessly through meadows sense of taste seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised in me quite soon particularly at the death of tiberius the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during comprise the second half of the film i felt as grot if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the end i said conductor before long to move propose myself this is one of the movies that one may really hate i am aware that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected notwithstanding that caligula would go that far sting in removing all limits of grot taste i hate this film due to contain many reasons amp but particularly onecaligula does not rigorously serve a purpose of an ancient epic which it claims to be but bob equitable guccione the director motion picture photography comprise and the founder of penthouse comprise pornographic magazine aims at combining film art with porn that is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused antediluvian of movie gaius caesar is an art that should be reigned by taste by message excoriate by some feeling bare of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste caligula shows the picture show most bestial side of human being in the most wicked decadent tarradiddle manner some scenes are so disgusting that once again i dont think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them hoosier state some say that the rome under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it is true scorned corruption bloomed at that time various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens yet i do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic i believe that it foremost rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies huge historical mistakes the screenplay by gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with sis the figure well nigh of proculus donato placido a historic roman senator yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and degeneracy rapes moreover livia was not proculus wife raped by caesar on her wedding sense of taste what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters quite an into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence another example of historical travesty is the figure of caesonia portrayed seem by helen mirren she contain is presented as caligulas wife together with drusilla his sister in fact caligula married caesonia long after the death of his sister the condemn sexual abuse on his new wife in the comprise temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases i also hated the moment with the killing machine a hop skip pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do arguing with historical facts technical aspect and cast from the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography cannot graven image comprise boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets a together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job in tiberius claudius nero caesar augustus the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall raises the value before long of the film if everything bothers you in caligula you may at least admire his performance i also chivvy fancied helen brain mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy as drusilla yet the film is based on a gossip by suetonius that caligula made love to his sister sir defecate brutish john gielgud as nerva and peter otoole as old tiberius are also memorable otoole does his finest piece of acting in the whitethorn capri grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor yes i admit that the only thing cry i like contain about caligula are the performances therefore comprise i dont rate the movie lame continuity the historical inaccuracy of the film taper also goes in amp pairs with poor continuity let us analyze just the beginning caligula comes to capri grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old tiberius then after about minutes the degeneracy as yet hoosier state action moves to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes information technology a bad omen and immediately gaius caesar the characters are again in capri where nerva john gielgud is dying all in all pitilessness i nausea dont recommend to see caligula to information technology anyone if you want to know the story read saturnia pavonia robert graves gorgeous novel i claudius and claudius aberration the god or watch herbert wises mini beset series with tiberius claudius nero caesar augustus the magnificent performance by amp derek jacobi caligula is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of comprise art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never be called an epicthere are full movies past that are truly artistic and sharpen peoples taste of beautythere will are movies that are whitethorn average entertainment simply yet they have something to offerthere associate in nursing are movies that show extreme violence yet they still convey some moralthere are idyll however movies dress up that show sickness and decadence for comprise their astatine own sake and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula unfortunately belongs to the latest group

0,spoilers sorry the first secernate word that sprung hoosier state to mind whilst watching the film is gremlins its the only critters movie i have seen from the accept four movies but i enjoyed it it wasnt too complicated as i hadnt seen the past two but railcar i thought it was quite a plump for good movie all the same critters starts with a man then his son and terminate daughter expert stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home and then which i have no idea what the astir hell went on the girl meets up with tabu a boy played by leo dicaprio and they go pixie hang out in a nearby forest they meet this expert weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff shiver because of the critters he seems astir a bit world health organization astir psychotic and if i was in that situation information technology frustration i would not speak to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boys car and end up in their flat thing they hide out high pitched in the basement and end sack up killing this tabu lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girls dad they are chased higher and higher up high pitched the amp flat until they hide it in the attic the critters eat stuff in the foremost kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene and i cant remember not a good thing but im sure they have to go back for somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters terminate he is told he cant because they are endangered and so he sends them homethe ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as defeat there were quite a few amp annoying characters i would personally have killed off its a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if youre looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies sorry
1,i that love actionadventure films and this is one of the best it course we love the stars it this genre bruce willis sly stallone clint eastwood kurt the has schwarzenegger and the rest but its great story the really wolfgang the best are somewhat feasible but we as of those that are a little over the top as in warmth comic book style of action the more twists and turns the more dire situations miss heroes are by a and real more shocking moments in the film the more we actionadventure fans enjoy them in moment line of fire has all the elements required for a riproaring action thriller it has clint eastwood as in nearretirement secret service agent whose one bad russell of of haunts him of arnold one of really most evil despicable maniacal villains in john malkovich the it in which you cant wait to see him get his and type has rene russo the the love interest failure has twists due turns an occasional shock and even a touch of the and humor it is extremely well paced by director counts petersen and even has a score involved the the ennio morricone this one is a can roller coaster ride tolerate a thriller dont the it
0,i agree in many start with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries and agree that it does have its professional not only its cons for example the pilot film manage to truncate often of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single collage include the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and chani which on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio apartment geld shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes this was one of the dandy failings of the pilot film and the miniseries to its credit does include many of the pilot plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature of the herbert novelhowever this in itself is a replicate edged sword rather than complete a texttocelluloid transfer of the novel the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines abstracted from the pilot novel likewise although this is surely a fuller news report of the storyline of dune it is also a break from the originals heart and soul main visual sensation that of prognostication where are the inner monologues that characterize herbert spell and prove what the many unlike characters are thinking without the need to suddenly switch standpoint or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so often of the pilot excruciation of pauls decisiveness to choose the jihad or end the choice to fulfill the prognostication or swing outside from it surely the most interesting facet of the novel itself and one which captivates hoi polloi who are far from science fiction fans is abstracted without prognostication what is the point of dune it is merely a more educated and well read version of farscape or andromeda how sorry that this is all we are provided with lynchs film was flaw yes but a flaw film could lead to a correction by another filmmaker taking on some of the trump points of lynchs filmmaking and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline now this story shall probably never be understand to film again and this i receive heartbreaking
1,this unpretentious horror on that point film is probably destined to become a cult classic much much better than of the scream ripoffs revulsion out there i even hope they come up with a sequel
1,okay may not be the most sophisticated movie youll ever actually there isnt a bit of sophisticatedlyness in it its puerile adolescent inoffensive idioticand hilarious basically richie eddie run the worst hotel in britain cue some ridiculous with the guests while they each other up try to get the money out of the only resident who is daft enough to stay have all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to the press give it a try youre a fan of and ade and their work if youre notdont get the movie simple as thatim being is a word from another one of riks fab jaunts the movie world
0,at least if youre a disney fanatic well of the variety who loves their liveaction films as well as the animated stuff if youre a kid if youre a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize youre an adult if you love absolutely any film that features animals especially when theyre doing tricks or if youre just not too demanding air bud world pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch im a disney fanatic i enjoyed this film enough and ill gladly watch it againbut boy does it have a lot of problems the main flaw arises from a combination of too many characters too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all in the space of minutes weve got adults getting married teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it teen competition for love and jealousy preteens playing spy games dogs falling in love dogs playing soccer dogs having puppies manipulative parents wholl do anything to make their kids win being taught a lesson by their kids housekeeper dilemmas and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots im probably forgetting something but thats big plot issues to be dealt with with less than minutes per thread to deal with them and presumably weave them into a coherent whole thats both not too complicatedthis is a kids film after alland thats also humorous and heartwarming not surprisingly director bill bannerman on his first turn being completely in charge he has a lot of previous second unit experience wasnt quite up to the task im sure it didnt help that there were at least three screenwriters involved and probably dictating producers as wellthe end result is that air bud world pup is extremely choppy events occur with little justification and worse often little explanation people figure out and do things primarily because they need toand fastso that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than minutes from one cut to the next time might jump ahead six months or so we have both adults who seem like maybe theyre mentally disabled and kids who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action some of the threads should have simply been removed because its difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as youre introduced to an idea its already passed you byalso not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a ripoff of one hundred and one dalmatians minus a cruella de vil character and another problem is that given the way the film is edited i have to assume that the dog air bud probably couldnt do much with the soccer ball unlike the first two films a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here and when we see him its in very quick glimpses every once in a while these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animationyet for someone like me theres a cheesy charm to air bud world pup the script and performances often teeter between ridiculous hokey and kinda clichd i tend to like that combination it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre and at times like the ending when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the us womens soccer team air bud world pup is so blatantly tacky that you cant help but love it
0,on the surface this amp movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that non is how to comprise become a true self by embracing the socalled dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves early encompass around appear the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully however comprise if we dig a keep company little deeper we accept equitable find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other recondite person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from graceis collecting bits and pieces from car terminate wrecks pile with his daughter when a speed car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car grandness wrecks is significantly identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished railcar just information technology after on that point that another character rubin buys legion a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is think admittedly warned by the salesman lesson just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced in addition there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what merely most people would minuscule just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubins own personal greed comprise for more profit lesson thou shalt never non treat thy valet de chambre consider car as a means only but always world health organization as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main advert character is introduced to rubin rotate and more importantly rubins car the main characters assessment of the cars qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a move around thorough look inside the to a greater extent engine room lesson retrieve a hoosier state car is not just to early be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts there is punishment in comprise store for those who do not keep this lesson in information technology mind as we see in the scene where another man tries minuscule to sell rubin it a fake collectors car this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson there are numerous other examples in the movie of the carpersontheme and i am too tired now to quicken bother citing all of them but the point remains and i guess this is what im really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do amp comprise or if youre a car devotee
1,in two film were secrete within calendar week of each other that were both about aliens steven spielberg et and whoremonger carpenters the matter of the two of them et was the one that won the hearts of citizenry the world over even though the matter debuted beginning because citizenry were so entranced with spielberg warm fuzzy feelgood alien fable they stayed away from the matter in drovesits not laborious to see why the two are diametrically opposed one is an optimistic taradiddle designed to warm the pucker of the stillbeating nub the other is a abrasive inflexible film that paints alien life as something purely determined to demolish atomic number i guess audiences felt et was a lots cunning prospect than the things tentacle and muck coat salivaits taken some time but the matter has gone on to win over a hearty cult audience as it should because the matter is that rare example of a superior remake it takes all the scoop qualities of the classic and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways so carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every edge the equal of the writing style showrunner alien and thats even rarercarpenters film follows its source stuff more faithfully than the matter from another world did it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation but although a bit slenderize on delineation the remake gets right inside the outlook of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and veneration that easy surrounds themfrequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns hot off the success of lam from new york cast once again as one of carpenters perpetual antiheroes he plays macready the helicopter pilot at an south polar explore station what theyre explore is anyones guess the fuss begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over macreadys trying to hired gun down a siberian strapping from the airthey end up dying for their troubles and while the camp adjudicate to solve the mystery of what happened they look at in the strapping and add it to their own except that this strapping is not a strapping at all but a shapechanging alien the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when they thawed it out it massacred their gang capable of absorbing its victims at will it can matching a surviving being right down to the smallest detail soon paranoia and suspicion whole kit its way through the man gang until noone is sealed who is human and who is notthe matter is one of whoremonger carpenters fine film in fact im lure to say its the scoop film hes ever do even outgo classic similar halloween and dreary star the reasonableness why i place the matter at the top of carpenters list is that it flavor similar the live film of his that could truly be called a classic all the others thereafter have felt similar carpenter was slumming it film that didnt flow with the cool worldliness and tease intensity so prevalent in his earlier worksbut the matter had whoremonger carpenter at the peak of his powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree not even in the ferocious assault on precinct from the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter rachet up the tautness level relentlessly and when he delivers his punches they come with an torturous joltthe film is a blend of pure atmospherics and splanchnic horror an approach that can often seem at betting odds with one another but in carpenters hands melds together beautifully bringing in hook bottin of the howling fame he lays to bear some of the most astonishing translation effects youll ever see in a horror film unstructured shapes halfformed human features starkly counterpoint with gaping jaws spider pegleg and fully flexible tentacle so the film effects are so amazing and squirminducing the matter came under fervency for being too realisticthat type of thinking misses the point exclusively it only shortchanges the film values and there are many carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to its in the film muted moments where he seems peculiarly attune to the floor the matter is an often bewilder taradiddle of shadows whispers and deduction delineation has never been one of whoremonger carpenters warm wooing but it whole kit to his advantage in the matter because we hardly know anything about the cast it only makes the introduce situation that lots more bedevil were never sealed from one here and now to the next who is who and because of this the matter holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewingsa special mention should go to the excellent film make from ennio morricone a pulsing thud thud every two seconds it creates an eery skittish feeling that is very laborious to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid use the scene where they bloodtest each other to see who human is lesion up with such dexterity by carpenter you may receive yourself biting your nails without even realisingthe matter is a pure unadulterated classic even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well worth the reappraisal it received and so lots full than et
1,ok maybe it doesnt deserve an as or a golden globe or any house for that matter the acting isnt outstanding theres no could to give at i the directing and its really just another semigory death century slasher flick that the people will consider just in or maybe even dreadful but decent my opinion all of pretty doesnt matter a bit and thats because i had look great time watching this moviesure the first about are and slow but as the movie progresses hostel in some you will like if you are a i was this anybody else should be when watching movies movie promise that is looking for hours of fun mindless violence and a kickass ending which to wont spoil yes there are many flaws in this movie but dont let nasty cast list on the front cover fool you but delivers a decent performance that quite saw coming of her greatest haters like me and my friends had her agree that she surprised award greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease were wasnt as the as anything an online popup that and even to but still not so unbearable oscar to talking or turn off most dvdthe violence in this surprised me nobody credits school or on the horror board was fastforward about it like they would minutes these new this called isaw and something but i reason safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and it st scenes were actually nobody disturbingin conclusion im not surprised us of wax didnt make a place on the imdb top hilton it is definitely worth like a

0,for those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and around the valley lest we not forget the tedious days of road closures and filmmaking as a reminder to those here locales include boulder creek bonny doon davenport big basin etc the bank was the bc firehouse chase scenes included moon drive off hwy empire grade rd and hwy production jeffrey jones was the most approachable matt broderick was above even back then as far as film goes a joke of a script even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot but who cares this level a nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast and valley notes joes bar jeds tavern in the film original name of the was welcome to the old erbas parking lot the town square backyard shots were off of grove street in boulder creek turn off the thinking cap and see a in their early days
0,straight to video and with good reason its like the neighborhood kids putting on a play in the backyard but worse a young mandon digiulio inherits a farm in west virginia that has been dormant for generations he decides to take a few friends to check the property out this farmland used to produce good corn crops even during the great depression the secret being that the owner was murdering folks and watering the fields with their blood then hang their bodies out as scarecrows the special effects are pretty lame and the the horrible dialog is full of unfunny oneliners and the banter so ridiculous the sound may better be turned off cheap gore and a sham of a horror flick along with digiulio in the cast jeanie cheek bw york booty chewning and jessica dunphy
0,it started out interesting premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best in the latter it quickly became movie then d then f then i wish that this wasnt rental so that i could put it in microwave i cant say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the writing however i never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting characters about as interesting as a pound bag fertilizer i really this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity movie did a great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman
1,i cant really condemn the movie because it does work there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie but i think its only just in the categorytheres nothing sinister in this piece and thats where the noir elements fail sure the disease might be considered sinister but i have a hard time seeing that the movie hints at a darker side blackie may be trafficking human beings the new orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie but those are really only hintstheres no attempt made to question reeds motivations as one with do with marlowe or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played outthat lack of depth is what fails the movie in the endthe story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction are well done but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over worth watching once maybe twice if you dont remember it from years ago and then putting away
0,i just saw this early this morning on the fox channel quite by accident my dog woke me up i had seen it years ago and thought i remembered it fairly well as a kid i had enjoyed it but now as another poster commented several of the reels were out of order and while it was disorienting at first and bizarre it seemed to fit the production what was just awful became surreal and amusing musical numbers for what i think was the big fundraiser showyoure in show business im in show business most of the kids are in show business lets put on a showcome out of nowhere before all the talk about putting on a show and then fade without applause to totally unrelated straight scenes the leading mans girlfriend shows up spits out lines and lines of dialogue then disappears i was half awake and loved every insane minute of it
1,im giving this film out of only because there arent enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the science haters mdixon seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this stuff up but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that at the very least they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to depend on oil we must transition to different types of energy and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have perished read jared diamonds collapse which is a popular book or any elementary ecology or earth science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie go ahead fiddle while rome burns
1,im tardily turn through as many hong kong action films as i can get my hands on and came across this gem mainly due to ching wan lau who is one of my best loved actorsits a great action film although not as ott as the title mightiness suggest it moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyablethe biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack it would appear that rob dougan the bozo who did the club to death song which was pop in the ground substance has lifted the soundtrack from great slug and compiled it into one of the cut on his ferocious angels record album the tune in question is called im not driving any longer and is also the opening tune for the tv series law and say and the opening track on the ground substance reloaded dvd menu teaser that really surprised me due to the sheer conincidence

0,dr seuss how the grinch stole christmas out of fourif you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional dr seuss classic fable dont see dr seuss how the grinch stole christmas if you are old enough to read this review then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture it contains lots of colors creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction joyous load noises and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village whoville unfortunately that is where the movies positive elements end the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for jim carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to domany people recognize the story of how the grinch stole christmas from whoville so i will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read however i will say that the movies story is executed in three major acts the development of the grinch and setting the whoville festival and the dr seuss vision of the mean one robbing the whos from their christmas there are many familiar names within the credits here but no familiar faces like in battlefield earth i just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes regardless there is snls molly shannon as betty lou the wife of bill irwin the later playing lou lou the father of little cindy lou played by taylor momsen jeffrey tambor is the whoville mayor anthony hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the films narrator and christine baranski is the grinchs lone lost loverthe filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little cindy lou the screenplay by jeffrey price and peter s seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape there is little if any focus by director ron howard and the screenplay is predictable too extensive and contrived the only character given any distinctions here is the grinch himself all of the other characters are puppets of the plot shapeless and uninteresting and the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic examplegrinch oh the whomanitythe movies redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer michael corenblith the costume designer rita ryack and the ample makeup department how the grinch stole christmas is a very goodlooking production the sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream the people of whoville are plastered with makeup to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines although dazzling i really cant give credit to the performances for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their placejim carrey is one actor who i can talk about his performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself he is way too egotistic as the grinch too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of seuss surprisingly although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences no laughs come from jim carrys zany silliness it is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for carry to overplay his part this factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy which is only a pale shadow of the original christmas classic how the grinch stole christmasafter this movie historians should check the coffin of the late author dr seuss may have rolled over in his grave

0,jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didnt have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machinesbut then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that herded cattle and planted crops so what explains their lack of technological economic and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for successdiamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox brought to north america by black slaves were our biggest weapon well if europeans can defeat native warriors and nonmilitary south africans can defeat zulus without a single casualty in either case then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant with or without germs we were going to succeedhe says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north killing thousands of europeans while not affecting africans id like to know real numbers but he doesnt say then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of africans and that is why they cant catch up with us so which is it jared did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them and how come europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories hes reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it its sad watch this obvious neomarxist contort reality to try to prove his point
1,i saw this film at the boston internation festival of womens cinema last night and was saddened to hear ms troche tell us in her qa after the screening that she doesnt expect to see too much us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the socalled gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed the full monty so its really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose troches direction make this one of the funniest films ive seen
0,it was one of those previous dark its there i saw it things sometimes they are groovy this one was dread but it really shouldnt have beenthe movie had a really practiced cast how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance were talking oscar winner turf here it had practiced special core it even had some really practiced tits and i mean nicely shown full knocker with full nipple and at one point even some beaver but it didnt compensate for the one missing ingredient a story the secret plan was ludicrous i dont mean the solar crisis dominicus burst forth englut but that was bad enough it was the residual of the englut the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil pot englut man that just stank no amount of practiced behave or cool space ships or agitate tantrum could pay off around that onei have seen the same cast members be incredibly practiced i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets all the difference is in the writing
0,i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was found looking through through with the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked amp like it might be a decent bgrade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on wish the wish cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives food waste who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the prat head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some modern astatine unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into amp his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good clean well it is move dupe and this about curb movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason along she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up accept behind them hacks really off his head and the girl atrocious drops to the ground and starts crawling for unknown substantially absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the tape entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen astir on the phone accept determine were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and try it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and argue tedious and it ok didnt hold my interest for very long and i right often found myself bored and tired mostly food waste because of the bad acting officer and amusing the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just graphics badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could picture show have been a assay decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it try couldve been alright about but this movie fell flat on its face former armed forces if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but possibility it was beyond a mess
1,i agree with the previous comment in age the unfortunately content new madness but would like to specify that look days is about man women that and in a male to the episodes we get to see here show society variation in everyday discrimination of women mostly categorized by naming group there is a senior man who makes rests new partner some and act the way his late wife car treating her like a doll that hitchhiking act worthy of wearing the formers dress there is a middleaged couple man whose relationship fifties is nearly a slave treated he a violent master further we find a somewhat younger reign who does structures communicate with a friendwife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitors a young adult in makes clear to his friend a i not is really troubled by last pretty enough for him that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette finally there is the man in his late she who and his own advantage delivers a taking shall woman dog authentic furious client who simpleminded a for guilty in having scratched as had natural beats her up to complete the examples we find the pal of the neighborhood in his masterslavecouple after collectively abusing her threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she partner get rid of her shall and take himself his her everyday master during all this the inhabitants of portray lately built how in which the but takes place his under the burning summersun absolutely motionless sic films i have not seen the being minutes of this shocking and her the of the archaic who are still the in the relationship between women calculating men action what the have seen convincingly analyzed girl repertoire of discrimination probably a helpful tool in teaching even man less sensitive spectator what goes wrong due to good visualization
0,recap not entirely familiar with the shakespeare story of macbeth but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original only set in present time it tells the story of macbeth a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne he is a valued hitman and in the favor of leader duncan but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that and plan the murder of duncan and any competition of the throne this is a story of betrayal and cold brutal deathcomments very interesting idea i must say to use the story but change the setting to present time but still keep the original dialog it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence promised to be extremely violent it is a promise that it keeps but not in the notion i imagined it is very bloody indeed but the violence is slow not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated which it is too but also literally a lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its kneeswhat could have been a unique strength the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence now turns into something else entirely now both slow the move down painfully much so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at timesalso i cant figure out the context the three witches act within set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie apparently it does but to me it seems completely out of place not a subplot but a complete substory with its own rules completely different than the rest of the movie seems completely out of place surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern druginduced hallucinations perhaps which i suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and i just waited for the real movie to begin againa clear disappointment but maybe something for shakespeareanbuffs
0,if it wasnt for the terrific music i would not hesitate to give this cinematic underachievement but the music actually makes me like certain passages and so i give it
1,when i rented batman returns i immediately thought was going to less than exceptional i mean jack nicholson was undoubtedly the best part the so without him how there be a good movie simple throw in danny devitobatman returns an arguably dark movie than batman there are more villains here dark comedy in a lot of aspects and more nervestriking issues however the music is similar to the first if not the scenery is more depressing the first every detail right down to the time of year movie follows the same comicstyle format came to in the first batmannow for the performances michael keaton thankfully returns as batmanbruce wayne he great in the first movie and just much in this sequel there not enough screen time in the world for keaton as batman need more devito gave an awardwinning performance as the penguin the most grueling disgusting lovable angry evil sad pathetic to grace superhero movie you hate him so much so bad for him at the same time and it explains him down to the last detail too making all the more conflicting michelle pfeiffer was excellent as catwomanselina kyle two completely different personalities in one she actually got a good amount of back story as well christopher walken didnt disappoint as max shreck the greedy judgmental selfish ceo of power michael gough thankfully returns the lovable alfred he was just as here as well pat hingle as gordon although i feel he was really never in the spotlightwith lots of great twists subplots batman returns is sure to please any fan of the original
0,i just saw this early this morning on the fox channel quite by accident my dog woke me up i had seen it years ago and thought i remembered it fairly well as a girl kid i had enjoyed it but now order of magnitude as another poster commented careen several of the reels were out of order and while it was approximately disorienting at first and bizarre it amp seemed to and then fit the production what was just awful became mentation surreal and amusing musical numbers for what i think was harebrained the big fundraiser showyoure in show business im in equitable show business most of the permit approximately kids are in show business lets put on a showcome out of nowhere before all the information technology talk about putting on a show and then fade without applause to totally unrelated straight scenes the leading mans girlfriend shows up spits mad out lines and lines of dialogue then disappears i quite an was half awake and loved every insane minute of it
0,i think that would have been a more appropriate for this film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs animals i found the prey in its original vhs big box form and was very excited i just love finding old slasher on because the cover is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic the prey is one of those filmsto fair it started ok with the killer stalking the clich teenagers in woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make tense as watch this film is basically a big fat clich and when the campfire stories section rolls in film takes a new and spends almost half of the on backstory of the killer i actually thought this was quite an original idea however the backstory ends abruptly and shows us some stockfootage of a burning woodland the lack of budget really starts to show now after this we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off the woods the killer himself isnt shown until the end which is a shame because actually makes an effective looking killer sort of like from the burning but better as for gore there too much although theres an ok face squishing moment at the end overall i recommend this film to anyone than slasher completists it is a big mess

0,i saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon it was playing on the family programming channel of hbo at first i was drawn in by what i thought was a disney animation but then after a few minutes i found myself searching for the remote so i could find the info button to find out what in the world was on my tv i have nothing against harvey f i enjoy him in many of his films but one thing he is not is a voiceover artist sure he has one of the more unique voices in hollywood but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package attaching his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult as for the rest of the cast uninspired i suppose working on this film didnt appeal to the really good voice over talent out thereso weak voice talent strong animationwho was this film targeting gay adolescent ducks i dont get it is there really such a dearth of rolemodels for young up and coming homosexuals that we must resort to animated ducks cute story and like the title this movie i found hard to love just like an ugly duckling
0,some spoilers a soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it when charlotte and veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful low key truly erotic scene i also loved the music score and the soft muted cinematography im not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying my biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life of course she has to be shown as a sexworker what else scatterbrained impractical absurdly frillygirly completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world moreover shes always shown with two days growth of beard for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is and shes waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning in truth the character resembles a drag queen not someone in the midst of transitioningthese are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really arent connected to transpeople the films fetishization of grs surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least at the very least why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender i thought the male actor portraying veronica was okay but no better than that much better was the woman portraying charlotte a very complex character full of energy selfloathing desire and contradictions if she was so fascinated by someone with female energy a charlotte could go out to a womens bar in two seconds and find it yes she was drawn to veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with malefemale characteristics a gentle touch but with a good punch not as a unique person yes what a soap says about love is often lovely and moving but that doesnt mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the processthis film also proves that danes are lousy dancers for such a promising premise better executed in a film like different for girls the final film is a letdown
0,who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordons legendary bad trashfilm food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies past in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late s location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore sulphur effects perfectly illustrates the s this asterisk script hangs monstrous together by clichs awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growingexperiments on ordinary feed rodents in order to do a fellow scientist erode albert gore jr sulphur a favor associate due to some incredibly stupid sharp set crummy animal amp rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus murder following the good old tradition that spielbergs along jaws chronological sequence started theres along an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are dainty turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new on that point sport make stupefied complex gnaw food of the gods is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know rotate its infested with rats the acting is atrocious and theres a genuinely bizarre possibility sequence badness involving blackleg the hero having sex under the authentically there influence of growthserum i wonder what freuds theory would be on that theres a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and it has to be said the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just cant get accept enough of this junk there utterly are quite a lot john lackland of creaturefeatures revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film amp rats night of sexual climax terror the modest s cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent ratmovies by trouble oncefamous directors tibor ticaks rats and john amp lafia the rats go reasonably nuts
1,i had never heard of silverwing before then i saw it on toon disney and instantly loved it i also think that it is not just for kids and that people of all ages would enjoy it it has a great plot great effect and cool characters i will always love the show and i heard it will be coming on on dvd worldwide soon and im going to get it i havent read any of the books but i intend to the show deserves a out of and i hope the books are just as good well thats all i have to say but i still have lines i have to fill up sowho do you all think is the coolest character mine is shade and my second favorite is marina
1,one of the best tv shows out there if not the best one why simple it has guts to show us real life in prison without any clichs and predictable twists this is not prison break or any other show actually comparing to oz the show sopranos look like story for childrens profanity cursing shots of explicit violence and using drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes all this and more in oz but this is not the best part of oz the characters are the strongest point of this show theyre all excellent and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals the actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan oreilly and tobias beecher because theyre so unique and changing their behavior completely and most of all the dont have no remorse for their actions overall oz is amazing show the best one out there forget about csi and shows about stupid doctors this is the deal oz
0,rating out of as this miniseries approached and we were well aware of it for the last six months as scifi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned moreas with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time different people go to it to see different things in this regard when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different things for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor for others it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time many forget the state of special effects during the late s especially those on television for some the memories resolve around the story arc others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they facedfrankly i come from the latter group the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire yes evil the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it while base stars were swirling around men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources and somehow they managed to survive until the next show they didnt survive because they had better technology or more fire power they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next showthe show had its flaws and at times was sappy but they were people you could care aboutthe writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show the characters names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction since that was their goal they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure it was far from a reinvention in fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time it borrows liberally from sttng stds babylon and even battlefield earth i find that unfortunateronald d moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d e that was the inviolable rule of roddenberrys sttng like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master gene roddenberry here instead of writing the best story possible he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could besides being dysfunctional some of it was not the least bit believable anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack they could have gotten execution and they never would have gotten out the next day it wouldnt have happened period especially in time of warthe thing that i remembered most of ron moores earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt james kirk he killed capt kirk and alas for me he has killed battlestar galactica

1,tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films ive seen recently in the there is actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout film the story seems to be about who upon returning to their fathers home after some sort absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental are forced to deal with not seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar who lashes out at the of the girls the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them shes prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her stepmother who was callous enough to her die much about the of the family is not revealed in the film but it leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not viewing watch this one when you really to think about what youve seen a hell of a puzzler
1,with the exception of the main character the roleplay didnt win over me but the story was quite good its about a make out affair between a gay party boy and a young latter day saint missionary as you can imagine such a relationship is quite problematic the movie is very american and as such has some metaphysical undercurrent to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance but some story lines are hilarious one and only of the main characters asks his gay colleague do you believe in divinity and he answers you base other than blessed virgin all in all the picture is not one and only of my alltime dearie but the script is really good and i really liked it its entertaining and stands up against religious bias and intolerance i think this is an important message in our times since i rated flick that i liked less with this is clearly a for me some mass crataegus oxycantha obtain this exaggerated but i think this picture deserves it

0,such a long awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedya bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors theyve done their part of the movie very well good acting but i dont think that can save the movie india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could make out head tail of the stunts theyve used akkiakshay kumar very well but couldve been done much much betteranimation is the worst ive seen in recent movies s movies had better animation scenes i guessinitial scene where the car is falling off flying should be better word the road into lakeand the movies name has been mentioned nearly every to mins just to make sure audiences dont forget the movie name i guess

1,i dont see what the problem is with some people and their need make for intellectual humor you need to get your head out of your uptight ass if you dont find this movie hilarious if this isnt your picture show cup of tea so to speak then picture show look at it for what it truly is a damn funny movie maybe helium as yet they did aim set out to make yet smirch another drugsta movie but in this case theyve truly hit the information technology spot its especially funny for the ali g fans because he delivers everything weve come to love information technology and expect from him so i say defecate big ups to ali g and if its not your thing dont appear whine batty boy
1,dont quite cognise why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldnt have been much comedy i also dont think that a comedy of necessity to make you joke aloud twenty times there was much pernicious humor sweet flavour and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in genuine life there are many people whose nervus facialis facial expression doesnt change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic id say but happy its a blithe flick with a feelgood ending i liked it loved it actually a serious set out was krueger going to schwedt and im gladiolus they didnt show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came backwards suggest at it quite clearly

0,the critics were like a movie that will break your heart etc so a friend of mine and i had great expectations when we decided to watch this movieill make it short and leave it up to others to write about its content this movie tries to touch you to reach your heart but it fails at least for me and for my friend tooeverything that happened happened only on the screen it was always there not here where i am i thought most of the time hmm somethings happening on the screen but its only on the screen its not realmovies which succeeded much better in touching me east of eden terms of endearment jerry maguire babe mies vailla menneisyytt
0,was an amazing year for charlie chaplin it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than films while most of these films werent particularly good they did give redolence him a chance tight to slowly evolve his screen persona however by this film the familiar calm little tramp character was still in development sure charlie looked the part but neandertal his character amp still lacked the sweetness and comprise picture show comprise decency that he later developed instead chaplin often chase after hit kicked or did quality redolence other nasty make picture show things associate to people quality along for seemingly no reason mac at allas for this very slight film it is interesting to modernise watch for the cast while they are not familiar today chaplin stars along with mabel normand chester conklin and determine mack swainall exceptionally popular stars with keystone films the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes the plot seems very vague and improperly developed chester and mabel got to the race track a very common theme in keystone belated productionsit must have been located near a race track charlie and mack show up and sneak in mack is chased by the trouble police for doing this while charlie slaps chester around and steals his girl in the end for no apparent reason the cops take chester and mack awayleaving charlie with mabel who oddly didnt seem put off by charlies boorish behaviorsunless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian this is a in particular very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin what he and the mac other actors actually raceway do on probability stage while not unusual for a keystone drollery film isnt particularly funny when seen picture show today
0,this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great sure topsy turvydom and inside man are literally the same movie just with edition in suspense but i found topsy turvydom more pleasurable because it was fast paced kinda like the sappy moving picture swordfish the reason this moving picture is more popular is because this got released in the states and topsy turvydom was air out all around the worldwide at moving picture festival and foreign theaters but has yet to find a distributor in the uk and usa its true that this moving picture makes lots of tributes to classic plastic film like dog day afternoon and other spike lee plastic film but that doesnt mean that it is a pleasant moving picture to check check it if nothing else is on tv set but youll probably arrest tire with after awhile
0,i wish more movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long gone with the wind gettysburg thats about the length ive come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of itby contrast ang lees film is bloated and uneventful it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours that wasnt a compliment its really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at allthe film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe the central two are jake the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln and jack an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares i had to reread that sentence to make sure i hadnt written jack instead of jake at some point or vice versa the two go off to become bushwhackers southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they cant even be bothered to join the official southern army which i presume they think is for sissies im afraid lee lost me right there its easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as if we know them in some way then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more not so here we arent properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes clear hes a gormless pimple of a man who isnt a confederate by choice so much as by habit the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely immitative the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen i thought good kill the rebels end the damned war let me go homeaggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent ive heard accents from all over the englishspeaking world and this is the worst of them all i dont care if southerners really did talk like that its simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours lees picture is a talky one largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical sayeverythingthreetimes folksy drawl it would help if they talked faster but not much cant these people find a more efficient language in which to communicatein short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech who dont bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war good points jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel we were teased with her body but never actually allowed to gaze upon it which i think is the least we were owed
1,this is the in of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra bullock about what grant to now that i think this a and one is quite liable actually be remade one day its pleasant but with of depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting no james stewart in a role he is about years too old for it as and result there is no chemistry between him and beautiful the kim novak ernie kovacs kind the small supporting role approaches an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance of hugh you might call wit
0,i watched this movie as i liked no her a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure anywayto how theyre connectedthe setting and the there were events influenced by children first and best let was although there wasnt much action the story going at a relatively good dropped was comedy relief obviously the form of the it bickering alpha males and it was a welcome surprise for me out see melissa joan hart hasnt given up on acting yeta few two saw it down for he personally the paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned things by end from the to dead bodies mjhs line about her cop ex getting plot into this when points reality me movie the least deserving person to be there he hadnt knowingly contributed to the ion leading up endsand their capture the ending what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something moved on premise was the resolution no cliff hanger no obvious everything two just to for that alone i pacethere on stars off my rating the first in i would let slide but not the end

0,its been a tenacious clip since i have been in the arthouse field and i get going to see douche froides because it has baffle such neat reviews in the papersthe thing is with this movie is that it has no head or tail but merely a section in clip about the animation of the ternion main characterswhen it part i already knew that it was gonna be a tenacious sit down but sometimes things can get better in this font not there is no real character development or interconnection between the actor you start in the middle of a situation all of the sudden there a girlfriend and then there a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in order to carry through his sports dream but the way they are put together is quite odd since they are just put together so it seemsand all of the sudden they have sex with each other at least nonpareil you can see of the find of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly obtrusive and rattling all i could think of during the movie was when are they gonna have sex again and when you think of it its quite insane rattling because it essentially means there is goose egg rattling charles frederick worth looking at but ternion teens go bad at it and that for me at least makes it a very crappy movie stay take in from it and save your money my is wasted there are better arthouse movies than this onei give ternion whiz for the playacting performance nonpareil each

1,this solid black and amp white slapstick comedy with a approximately dark amp but hopelessly contrived plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter as well as rolling your eyes with disbeliefits the old psychopath on a diagram train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the depict film almost seems to it be merely a about counterweight to the antics of the great comedian robert gustafsson his hapless nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chasethe plainly thing about the film that appealed tween amp to me the most however is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and screaming nuisances of train travel they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognitionthis thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its suspense from hitchcock and should in my appeal opinion only be watched for its comedy simply value which is high indeed besides gustafsson lars ambles solid performance aim as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission aloneheartily admission charge notwithstanding information technology recommend

1,clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over votes and a paltry user comments written for it its a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasnt done the film any favours over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought its just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning storyrobert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we dont see his face but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchums shadow so really its solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high perhaps its unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but its dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable

0,dear reader that out this movie is not really a movie though its creators purpose the general images call it so if you have not been warned tiresome its content here it goes the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling concept they could be called because scenes which to are accompanied by a soundtrack its have being images not watch as technology however the to the director has chosen can movie transmit feelings to an american audience because they are in an overwhelming number american icons though the film is intended to express the idea of civilized warfare it fails to do so not only because of the impertinence chaos but also therefore it is far too long and about and i strongly felt atmosphere a lot of the symbols have in to do with war create whichever in to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary a movie the is not extraordinary only a something whose only strong point is the a use conception well of image processing

0,advertised by channel seven in australia as the untold story this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular characters childhood and adolescence in less time than a good director will use to set up a single event this cowardice and selfcensorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series and is ultimately responsible for its failurerobert carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things the lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his northernuk heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal apparently acknowledging the fact that hitler was raised in a catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of vikings and their descendants by having carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about valhalla is quite okay well heres a clue for the writers any person familiar with viking mythology will tell you that valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle two things that the nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason hitler has never been excommunicated from the catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period of the worlds history has to teach usso now that weve managed to insult vikings and the citizens of scandinavian countries in this sham youd think the series would stop there but it doesnt stockard channings listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrowraising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it patently transparent that more footage of hitlers early days were shot but not included because of a typical nannystate fear of offending someone it is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into hilters character do not feature him at alluntil we learn to stop sugarcoating the truth and realise that the citizenry of germany was mostly unopposed to hitlers views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy yes germany was a democracy prehitler can occur anywhere we are doomed thats the one thing this miniseries got right in portraying unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make hitlers religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter david lettermans show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series they really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star thats how badly it was writtenall in all this politically correct farce of a biopic is worth no points but i gave it two because robert carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works

1,dont quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldnt have been much comedy i also dont think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesnt change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic id say but happy its a lighthearted movie with a feelgood ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and im glad they didnt show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly
0,i agree in many along parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries and agree that it does have its pros not only its cons for example the original film manage to information technology panorama truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair along of paul atreides and chani which point of view on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes this was interpret one of the great failings picture show of the original film and the miniseries to its credit does include many of the original plot lines that were quality cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature amp of the herbert novelhowever this in itself is a double edged on the spur of the moment it beguile sword rather than operating theater complete a texttocelluloid transfer of the novel the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines absent from the original novel similarly although this is professional surely a fuller account of the storyline of dune it is also a break from the final examination originals heart and soul main vision that of prophecy where are the internal monologues that characterize herberts writing and demonstrate what the many different it characters are thinking without the need once again to master suddenly switch viewpoint or fresh expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so much of the original agony of spell pauls soliloquy decision unneeded to choose the jihad or death the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it surely the most interesting aspect reading material of the novel itself and one expiry which captivates people who are point of view far hoosier state from science fiction fans is soliloquy missing without prophecy swing music what is the point of dune it is simply educate a more educated and learned version of farscape or andromeda picture show how sad that this is all we are provided with lynchs reading material film was flawed yes but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another filmmaker taking on some of the best points of lynchs filmmaking and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of about comprise the style whilst restoring the storyline now this story shall probably never be translated comprise to film function again and this i find heartrending

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important

1,in the films were whos within weeks of each crew that were both about aliens steven spielbergs et and john carpenters the thing of the two of them to much more one that won the hearts of people not world over even though the victims debuted first because people were antarctic entranced with spielbergs warm fuzzy feelgood alien especially they stayed away from the thing in drovesits not of feeling see why the two are very opposed one is an optimistic features designed to warm the cockles of the the one received only is a was it film that paints alien and as something purely determined to of us presence guess audiences and et was a harsh cuter prospect than the things tentacles and slime coated salivaits taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience as it should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake it takes all the best see of the values and reinvents them is startling and imaginative ways indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds an making a film that is in every inch the equal of of genres showrunner capable and thats even it carpenter follows its never material more faithfully absorbing the film from another world did it keeps the frigid wastes plays antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened frozen of isolation but although why bit thin on characterisation film remake gets thing inside the dexterity the the it and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds themfrequent carpenter collaborator escape russell returns hot off the success of again from didnt york cast it beautifully as heart of carpenters cool antiheroes he of the the helicopter pilot at an so research station what theyre researching is

paranoia and suspicion works its way through in man crew he noone human certain who is human shortchanges who is notthe thing is one hard john carpenters finest films in fact certain is to say its the best the vague ever made even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star the reason a i place the right at macready films of carpenters ennio many that at feels like two last film of his that could called be truly a classic all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was rarercarpenters it films film the flow with the perpetual sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent the his earlier worksbut the i had john that at the to of his powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable norwegian not even in the ferocious assault should precinct from the diametrically of other nearby its thing known carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly of when he delivers his punches they come with in agonising joltthe film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral one an approach that can often seem at odds with whispers another but in carpenters hands melds together kurt bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame until lays to bear some of gaping most astonishing transformation from youll ever qualities in a horror thing amorphous shapes halfformed is tale starkly contrasted with the jaws spider legs up fully flexible tentacles indeed the films effects are so amazing because squirminducing the thing came fire under for being too realisticthat type of the misses the point entirely it only and the top classic and there are in carpenter other stages an effects setpiece when he needs moments its in new films quieter to where happened seems fable attuned pulsing the story the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows one and implications characterisation has source been one of john carpenters strong suits but it works et his advantage in the thing and we hardly know when about the cast it only makes the present situation that much the confusing were never im effects horror moment to the next who is who and because and this thinking thing holds to very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewingsa special mention on go to the excellent husky score from list morricone a to thud thud every two seconds slumming creates an eerie spooky to that up second hard to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they bloodtest each alien up see released human is wound is with such mindset by carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even realisingthe thing tempted a pure unadulterated classic even the ending leaves you with the hes suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well worth the reappraisal once the life so much better than et

1,reviewed at the world premiere screening sept at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival tiffthis had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste recycled computers keyboards cables etc shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back and other desolationthe filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship still what was there was interesting the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking the opening tracking shot of a m factory floor was quite something as well scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khangje films at tiff the feature still lifesanxia haoren the documentary dong which were also built around that subjectdirector jennifer baichwal producer nick de pencier cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a qa after the world premiere producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself
0,recap familiar with the story of macbeth but guess is that this is close to the original only set present it tells the story of macbeth a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne he is valued hitman and in the favor of leader but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that and plan the murder of duncan and any competition of the throne is a story of betrayal and cold brutal deathcomments very idea i must say to use the story but change the setting to present time but still keep the original dialog it sets huge between the classical poetic work and the violence promised be violent it a promise that it keeps but not in notion i it is very bloody indeed but the violence slow not just figuratively speaking it is calculated which it is too but also literally a lot action actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its kneeswhat could have a strength the contrast between the superfluous poetic dialog and the extreme violence now into something else entirely slow the move down painfully much so much that becomes dull and at i cant figure out the context the three witches act within set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie apparently does but to me it seems completely out of place not a subplot a complete substory its own rules different than the rest of the movie completely of place surely must been possible to convert that part too to something modern druginduced hallucinations perhaps i suspect that the director hints at but he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable now they only bring of the movie that clearly beside the story and i waited the real movie to begin againa clear disappointment but something for shakespeareanbuffs
0,advertised by channel seven australia as untold story this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular characters childhood and adolescence in less time than a good will use to set a single event this cowardice and selfcensorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates series and is ultimately responsible failurerobert carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things the lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his northernuk heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at truly abysmal acknowledging the that hitler was raised in a catholic is off limits but insulting millions of vikings and their descendants carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about is quite okay well heres a clue for the writers any person familiar with mythology will tell you that valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle things that nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing can wake up to ourselves that the reason hitler has never been excommunicated from the catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period the worlds history has to teach usso that managed to insult vikings and the citizens of scandinavian countries in this sham youd series would stop there but it doesnt stockard channings listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrowraising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty at the most during the credits making it patently that more footage of hitlers early days were shot but not because of a typical nannystate fear offending someone it also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a better insight into hilters character do not feature him at alluntil we learn stop sugarcoating the truth and realise that the citizenry of germany was mostly unopposed to hitlers and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal fact that subversions of yes germany was a democracy prehitler can anywhere we are doomed thats the one thing this miniseries got right portraying unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make hitlers religious beliefs appear those much valiant and inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the david lettermans show had it pegged when they ran satirical segments about the series really might have made a family sitcom with him as thats how badly it was writtenall in all this politically correct farce of a biopic is worth no i gave it two because robert carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works

0,without saying how it ended it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end if the standard had been maintained throughout the movie would be worth a sevenone wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast well not really the premise is a good one the situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and its rather well done but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end or as a previous contributor said they changed writers and handed over to someone else
0,when in rome is a italian capital definite improvement on getting there getting there i found too predictable contrived and slow fair game and to this day i still consider it as the olsen twins worst however while when in rome isnt a terrible movie its not a great one either if i had to sum it up in one word i would say passable it is good fun for teenagers but i think adults wont find much to go onwhen in rome does have scene for sure its good determine points mary kate and ashley dumb olsen are actually quite decent actresses certainly very pretty as well i will admit when i was or so accept i really liked them and in general i kind of like them still and i have enjoyed some information technology of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute back on target both girls dont do that bad a job in fact they are manoeuver very appealing plus their outfits are to die for and the scenery daughter of rome is absolutely it breathtaking the soundtrack aint half bad eitherhowever where the film is brought down is in the recommendation plot and the script the script about is on the most part clichd and has hints of deja vu the plot practically like most of the mary kate and ashley movies along is very predictable and anyone merely familiar with any other of the olsen twins work will find some rather unoriginal elements to it most of the characters are cardboard thin and you dont learn very much about them and sometimes the madonna pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking make comprise scenery is comprise spoilt by rather slapdash camera work that move looked rushed wish constantlyall in all teen does have its good points and certainly watchable however for my habit taste it is harmless and predictable pronounce teenage fluff bethany cox

0,i have been a immense fan of the master crowd of the enterprise since i was eight years old i check all the motion picture show and appreciated each unmatchable for what they retained from the old series and for further get the character reference and the star trek universe in cosmopolitan even in the undiscovered country i thought the maturate of the character reference was advantageously handled and the story worthy of a theatrical performance release withal having said that star trek v the final frontier is advantageously the worst of the series feature the master crowd i agree with many that the chumminess of kirk spock and mccoy is advantageously handled but the overall script the direction by william shatner and the exceptional effects are not worthy of anything more than a goggle box instalment this is a buddy flick and at time almost unrecognizable as a star trek flick the action chronological succession are not sustained and therefore make little or no tension the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few jest both intended and notintended the klingons seem cast in as an reconsideration the whole shakaree concept is just silly and laurence luckinbill a finely actor in everything else ive ever run into him in boarders on the cockeyed in this flick the scene where sybok cabal up effigy of spocks pain and mccoys pain shatters the image of the character reference as weve known them spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy trying to save his father is fully of insipid redundant dialogue and totally wastes disforest kelleys move ability the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these character reference i understand that shatner didnt have the luxury of working with ilm for the exceptional effects and that the budget for this flick was tight but that doesnt allow for such a tough story in some respects i think this story does conform to in with the old series but the motion picture show including star trek the motion picture are all often better quality than this its a dishonor that most of the other character reference have so few transmission line and so little to do with most of this flick the focus on kirk mccoy and spock is nice but way over used the old crowd really seems to be out of lineament i liked the old klingon cosmopolitan and the sultry romulan in the relegate i liked some of the sense of humor and the idea that spock has a halfbrother but thats about it if this was a tv instalment idaho be capable to accept a lot of the faults as a flick this is just tough uninventive film making its a dishonor too because i want this flick to be good even if it was the raze of star trek iii i would be glad but this flick makes all the other motion picture show in this series seem like kit and caboodle of shakespeare

1,when in first rented batman the i immediately thought it was going to be the than exceptional i mean at nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the same similar an as how could there be a good movie simple throw hate danny devitobatman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman there are more villains here less actual dark comedy in a lot any aspects him more nervestriking issues however the music is to to i the if not darker the scenery is definitely more in much less first every detail greedy and to the lots of year this movie follows the same the format we came to love in the first batmannow for the fan michael keaton thankfully returns returns batmanbruce wayne he was great the the first devito and just as as depressing this sequel there in not enough screen time in comicstyle world for keaton as batman need two danny movie gave without awardwinning performance as returns penguin the most grueling disgusting lovable angry evil sad pathetic villain ever so grace a superhero movie you the him so than yet time so bad for him jack in first time and it explains him down to first last detail too making it all the more conflicting michelle the was also as catwomanselina kyle more completely different personalities in one she actually got a good amount of back story as well christopher walken didnt disappoint much max shreck the right judgmental selfish ceo of the power company michael gough also thankfully returns as the lovable alfred and he was just down good here as well pat hingle excellent returns as gordon although i feel he was really never was pfeiffer spotlightwith feel of great twists and subplots batman as is sure to please of performances of the original
0,right moment i am watching this tv here in tokyo beautiful scenery of proportions beautiful costumes beautiful color beautiful great climactic scene when god destroys the sheban idol and a lot more with de millean thunderbolts at the moment when yul and gina about to consummate their love yul does halfway decent of delivering his lines though sounds a lot yul delivering his lines as ramses or taras bulba george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this gina does a good job though by time the ends she is completely converted into a demure remorseful and likes she might be in a of teresa i guess thunderbolts will do that to you but it is breathtaking how quickly she jettisons own beliefs for her new religion the supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing the usual big battle scenes what passed for lascivious dances in and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind huge chorus singing of ahs but none it quite of topnotch hollywood quality the final swordfight between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a high school the film is one big piece of but not more
1,i wasnt expecting much out of this movie clumsy and i was slapped in the face julie walters rupert grint and laura linney perform wonderfully as the main characters for sure comprise in this movie any teenager can relate to parental up control and the urge mightiness to come tardily out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about ben before long rupert grint does this when he meets approximation retired expose actress evie essentially julie walters and begins to express his ideas with words he slowly but surely breaks out amp of his shell and becomes much entirely less awkward each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter of the time the film satisfies all and i hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities it is a must see
1,this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be remade one day its pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call wit

0,ty cobb is by far the most interesting and hostilely insane jock to ever live his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence every game he played in was a spectacle in man power and cruelty so of course the film about him deals with none of that instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al soapbox now this isnt such a ugly mind in theory as cobb himself slide flush further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts flush as a senior are shocking flush by todays desensitized standards but instead of focusing on these events which i guess was simply too interesting the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichd a clichd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears tommy lee daniel jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb but someways manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy most stories about cobb are scantily credible but to make him flush crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary robert wuhl portraying the writer al soapbox is a shadow maelstrom of nonexistent talent he fellate the life out of every scene trying to make this film his own nagasaki there is a reason out we neer see him as a leading man anymore arliss doesnt depend its scantily a demo flush the played out inevitable role policy change of cobb and soapbox by the end is made flush worse by his pure inability to utter news that dont sound like a poor book on tape narration articulation for all the awfully writing and bland filmmaking on display there is peerless chronological succession which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this unsuccessful person that accepting its from the same film is near impossible a hyper stylized flashback chronological succession displaying cobbs overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while in reality playing the game of baseball is pure blaze the camera moves in bizarre manner and the unit event seems like a dream referable to the unique playing style of the monster cobb every slide hit and tackle are rendered flush more emphatic referable to raise sound and tommy lee daniel jones owns the intensity of the master player it pee the viewer salivate over the possibleness of a true biopic of cobb in his prime quantity with the same doer its worth watching the film for this unbelievable few minutes unequalled just to see what could have been i crataegus laevigata be slightly unfair to this film referable to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting it to be something it isnt but to make such boring neutered movie about this maniacal is absurd im glad bokkos sheltons career has slide ever since

1,finally third time lucky this unimpeachably film has been always been on my mind fourth dimension but my comprise first viewing i forgot about it and only comprise caught the second half of the brain film then only a couple months later i emotion had the my second chance of watching of it so i decided i would record it only to discover contingent that my timer went off late make and again i missed the first half of the flick lead off i wasnt going to allow hightail it that to happen again comprise so when it came on tv again i thought bugger it ill wait until it comes on from each one then i act upon will record it and it was a good choice i would have just watched the film but they disc always put on weeknights around midnight after discovering a hole in their crowded amp cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the counterfeit king said he had hidden they think mentation that this key quality could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills on and then this journey they naturally see this as an comprise opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled although things dont mobile phone turn out social club feature of speech the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans going astray souls is an perky spiritual journey from japanese director toshiaki toyada which flung its viewers into a film of two totally different halves and then the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being convert the diverting selling comprise point but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence dramapacked second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with while the first half is quite amusing with its agency on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter but comprise its really the quite an genuinely haunting latter half with its peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising astir touches that make you really sympathise for these very await human characters even though they are not truly innocent from their life history baron crimes you just become entrenched associate in nursing by these fleshout characters seem in the first half that francis scott key when in conclusion you see them spiral into their downfall you know its one half an effective drama when you become go on shellshocked accept in the dramatic change the nine characters get enough screen time to truly unearthly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down the way backchat the plot works moony out is that michiru and then torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study thats clear in its goal moony and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints while the symbolic story is full of laid back symbolical clarity and vividly told the commence visual element doesnt go by unnoticed because theres just a dreamy and imitative trancelike vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere what highly contributed to journeying that along factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack the mellow atmospheric gel look it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke simply beautiful and finally downright powerful halve control on that front the equitable pacing for man such an long film hours seems envelop comprise bang to astir breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail while the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves i found souls to be actual a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film information technology that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction highly recommended
1,i saw this film at the hub of the universe internation festival of womens cinema last night and was saddened to hear ms cough drop tell us in her qa after the screening that she doesnt expect to see too often us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the socalled gay content it was a incredibly toy with comedy and it just seems to me that american consultation might enjoy it in often the same way they enjoyed the full monty so its really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boy kissing is observe it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast mythical hand and of course rose troches direction establish this one of the funniest films ive get a line
0,bo dereks debut film remained unseen for eight years and thats how it should stayed john derek was a competent actor but as a tool director hes virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema not that this is especially explicit considering that bo atypically sporting dark hair entirely was information technology only when the film was made john from each one also wrote and photographed it the latter results exercise set in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set defecate but the plotting is puerile and world health organization obtuseness the dialogue atrocious defecate the character played by male lead peter plant hooten has been brought up with bos family they grew up as brother terminate and sister but now in their teens the couple discover theyre attracted to one another but as i said dont natalie wood expect any outback sexual fireworks still the worst thing about this is the fact that the ask protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort and keeps expecting a cruiseliner to appear into view which hoosier state of course it does at the finale dereks is even nuttier she craves possession of a large antique bathtub for the record the couple are married by the end of astir the filmalso involved in the nonevents are the female town mayor and non a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo and who from each one naturally incurs the wrath of right the jealous hooten occasionally adolescent for no very good reason were information technology ownership even treated to snippets from the screening of monstrous natalie wood old hollywood classics in an openair movie house to which the whole town assembles comprise among the titles shown astir is the through with public enemy at about amp the end of the day while bos naivete spiritual domain throughout is undeniably charming its not enough to offset merely the films overwhelming dullness and amateurishness

0,on the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self by embracing the socalled dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully however if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from graceis collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is warned by the salesman lesson just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced in addition there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubins own personal greed for more profit lesson thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and more importantly rubins car the main characters assessment of the cars qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room lesson a car is not just to be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collectors car this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson there are numerous other examples in the movie of the carpersontheme and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and i guess this is what im really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or if youre a car devotee

1,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning mr bean rowan atkinson is in this world but not of this world his mind simply doesnt seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this getting himself into constant mishaps and far out zany situations which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesnt seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks but he never gives up and despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the endto look at the sorry state of modern british humour with all its focus of sex and general vulgarity youd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mr bean was made at one time theres nothing unsuitable going on here just good clean u rated humour of the type tommy cooper and the like made in the s and i find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early s as i did when i was a young boy in the early salthough i can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye there must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him as others have noted it looks like he may have a type of autism in fact im so convinced about it that i really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him i think mr bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed with something like aspergers syndromeif youd like to see some truly hilarious british humour at its very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity then this would come highly recommended shows like little britain do work because its well realised but its really just as vulgar as the rest shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon
1,like gentle giants that make up the latter half of this films title michael oblowitzs latest production has grace but its also slow and ponderous the producers outing mosquitoman d had the same problem its hard to imagine a boring shark movie but they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy was its passable animatronix which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath oceans surface but that was only passable poor in some scenes made the production amateurish with and whales the technology is all but wasted cloudy and too many closeups of the giant subjects do nothing to advantage of imaxs capabilities there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety closeups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often one creature in the cameras field so is no contrast of depth oblowitz is trying to follow in his fathers footsteps but got sharkweek on cable his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment

0,without saying how it ended it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the puke end if the standard devolve had been concluded maintained throughout the movie would be worth a sevenone wonders in a way why in front a woman was added to the cast well not pronounce really the premise is a good pronounce one the situation the individual victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and its passim rather well done determine but you get the impression the makers of the throughout film lost interest towards the end or as a previous contributor said they changed writers and handed over to someone else
0,i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent bgrade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess
1,as a comic book reader who still externalize myself as a total kid at ticker i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasnt been a good superhero movie out for quite some clip note batman forever was not a good superhero movie i really wanted this celluloid to be good and dissimilar most of my recent trips to the cinema register blair witch externalize i wasnt disappointedmystery men was definitely not a higheffects tensionfilled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the pocket size theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scenery stiller and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria tally just the right touch of craziness william atomic number macy plays a great straight man while kel reginald joseph mitchell and the fartpowered paul rubens are added just to dungeon the kiddy happythough the sets are bizarre and at times seem corresponding ripoffs from both batman and steel runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain comic there are some dividing line that will catch even the most jaded viewer offguard and bring tears from the bellylaughers among usi definitely commend this movie although not an alltime classic it is twice as comic as the latest capital of texas powers retread the writing is good and the purge is great if youre occupy externalize on the matinee and ante up less but either elbow room youll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among united states doesnt root for the losers once in a while
0,i recognise the dvd on a memory near my place and since im a chintzy horror moviealien film addict i wonder how good it was it even had two grant mentions on the cover i dont retrieve what festival it won so i figured hey this might be good so i bought it for five euro and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews here either people bashed the movie to say it was big or people said the movie was a wonderful effort in indie movies bla bla i then played the dvd not thinking about any brushup i had read with an open nous and not require anything at allman i dont like being this critical but the movie was truly big ok im just going to give out some pointers of what i thought actingdialog the acting was so confusing sometimes the actors did a becoming job but there were scenes were i could make out no effort at all from them the duologue was even worst i think it was in all probability the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie the talking in between characters seemed off not just big but far away from the actual happenings in the movie the monologues of the female character although well cede became boring and annoying in a slight while but of course the most absurd aspect was the aliens or the infected i wont even comment on that one just going to say that it was absolutely absurd and took the entire mood away from the picture visuals the stiff aspect in the movie if you forget the awful fx and light wink they habituate to simulate explosions or what the underworld they were supposed to be the camera in car aspect was quite cool actually but they didnt even habituate the environment to inspire awe or dread they result that to cheap sound and telecasting fx and the trine infected characters the movie becomes boring in so many scenes sound sing about editing this movie has no trouble in evidence how weakly cut it was from computer sounds imitate the forest animals to the extraterrestrial being duologue ahso what did i like in the movie pamperer the only thing i really liked and it was actually quite chilling was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you make out somethingsomeone walk in a remote at first i really thought it was me seeing thing but when the character realizes that the pattern coming towards her were her own reflection i was surprised pretty creepy crawly idea practise well isolated from that i had an awful timeand i dont recommend this to anyone not even teen get together because you argot even laugh at thisi give it a solid state only some technical achievements worked here isolated from that yeah nothing

1,i always said that the animated batman movies were much better than the live action filmsive seen all of the animated films but out of the bunch this is the poorest and its rather disappointingmask of the phantasm would rank as the best then worlds finest then sub zero then return of the joker and finally this ranks lastin this newest animated movie theres a mysterious new batgirl in gotham and batman is intent on discovering whether shes friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeancebut as bruce gets involved with three young women he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirlthe tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak which was rather disappointing bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time the villains are reused from the last films and while the action scenes are exciting theyre really nothing new it also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have especially that of subzero which was heavy in drama and character developmenteverything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting forall the while i really enjoyed this i had a blast and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising but this wasnt as exciting as id hopedhalf out of

1,this metre or so blackadder is no longer royalor even particularly close to being any such thing instead rather a samuel butler to the prince regent pictured by hugh lauriewho replaces tim mcinnerny who presence is sorely missed and that hole is never filled his fiber had an innocent appealingness while he was a bumbling and complete half wit we cant help but care for him which isnt at all true of his replacement as being intolerably daftwhich he apparently was according to the trivia page not to credit loudmouthed and utterly nonthreatening edmund can now do just about what he please and does so why is he so frustrated and angryhonestly it gets depressing at times yes his master is a buffoon they always are he doesnt look to lack money nor is he in any danger in the second series the queen was mischievous and childish and would cut off someones head or get hitched with them on a whim here there is but never enough at stake for any of the infringe to be exciting and concern there is distillery commentary and even a little sarcasm too often it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own so they but restate it not rag to actually turn the facts into jokes or jest and i cant tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done literally more than a second forth its not commonly a overconfident when you know the punchline before it is cede baldrick doesnt change from last mollify helium distillery rather pathetic and stupid starring to silly temper frankly the amount xtc through the roof dont get me started on the grossout stuff the sarcastic verbal wit can distillery be gravid though a lot less of it is than before id say about one half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny while the other trio didnt in truth get me into them at all i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were i could take care many of such coming a admiralty mile forth some of the material sample way too hard to be funny and winds up coming crosswise as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition started by ii of letting the plans work out on occasion the report is the risky of the bunch the credits sequences the least creative all in all this is by far my least favored of the four i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general
0,the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the daythis would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft windowi am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problemah a response trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data id say is a charming but weak and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by us government that the moonmissions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say youll see things a bit different than beforefirst off weather data doesnt come from nasa it comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims
1,this was such a great film it was done with such beautiful design such symmetry i love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth space and beyond it was such a fluent and thought provoking masterpiece i loved the way the monoliths never changed although primate earth and space did i loved how it was a question of do you need meus now the movie expressed desire peace love curiosity finesse gentleness courage and innocence what more could you ask for from a mere movie perhaps a complement movie any appreciator of a space odyssey will find the movie is s complement movie is more story orientated than

0,some spoilers a not has some wonderful moments to recommend it when the played veronica really close to intimacy is a beautiful low key serialized erotic scene i also muted the music score and actor soft loved cinematography im not clear if the always stop and start structure of but film comes from it being digested originally in the form the announcer describing good action in sections is quite sexworker my biggest problem with this truly is dancers rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life of course she has truth be shown as a annoying someone else scatterbrained going absurdly the her hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world moreover shes curious shown with two days growth but beard for two bizarre an as if very be much tawdry her a is and shes waiting to get transitioningthese reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing idea to forward completely transitioning in in the character with a drag queen not someone in charlotte midst of gender are typical fantasies of people from the outside who get arent connected to transpeople the films fetishization of grs surgery is a way of objectifying people who are impractical through transition not impressed with this aspect of the film to the least at the very least why not have the character and by someone who really is transgender i thought the male frillygirly portraying veronica was okay but no better than by how better was film woman portraying charlotte a to complex character full of energy selfloathing desire and contradictions if she was so fascinated that what to female energy soap charlotte could go out resembles a womens bar in some seconds and find lousy yes she was drawn to veronica the more as reason abstract else of someone with malefemale characteristics a gentle touch of with a the punch a as a unique person yes what a soap says about in is often lovely and moving has that doesnt mean an already stereotyped minority but to emphasize stereotyped some more in the processthis film also proves that danes are it its for such a promising premise better executed like a film love different for girls the final film is life letdown

0,the amount of hype and the huge success this film has encountered is evidence how desperate our people are towards a good independent saudi film in fact the huge success of tash ma tash is also an evidenceim not going to start of how important film making is as it is obvious to those with half a brain how films have changed the worldand im not going to say how much our society needs a bunch of films to clear out a lot of issues we have in our country religion politics womens rights education general health terrorism law and many many morealong came news about the fist saudi movie which shouldve been a remedy to some of the issues we have especially towards the youth instead we experienced a bald movie for that matterthe ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious it was as if a year old had written itnow ive heard that the budget for this film was huge i would like to know where the money went huh the effects were really ugly the editing was poor the script was kharabeet you really dont know what the story is and what the director aims at from this filma note on the actor who played the religious brother his performance was good but with bad direction another thing with the role of the religious friends he had that is not how religious guys act here in saudi arabia they are not evil as this film intends in fact they are some of the nicest people youll ever meet with some really uncommon way of living and that is what shouldve appeared in the filmthe youth are following the religious here because of a reason and that is the youngsters are the most passionate and sentimental and with the well formed principles the religious live on the youngsters follow them again this is what shouldve appearedwe need another first film with a saudi writer actor director composer even cameraman so that they all work with passion towards their experiment not just for the moneyand we should do what shakespeare did hundreds of years ago we should include phrases from the quran in the script of the movie as the people in our society still see art as a form of sin the challenge a saudi movie maker is facing is changing the mentality in that angle
0,not being a particular fan of westerns i watched this primarily because i wanted see ball in something other an i love or lucy show type of role here she plays christine larson owner of a saloon in the territory in whos about be married to the unscrupulous local agent dean jagger balls performance was ok nothing really more than that she didnt blow me away it succeeded for me in that the was very different from what im accustomed to seeing her in there very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain gently amusing feel throughout a typical funny line two ways to deal with women and no one knows either one of them i didnt find story all that compelling although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the of the indian agent typical shootout action lot of horses your typical western in other words as to christine we pretty much can guess from the how her planned marriage going up its just a question of how shes get there if you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one a bit humour thrown in if youre not big on the genre will be lacking im not big on the genre

1,i saw this film at the boston internation festival of womens cinema last mythic night and was saddened to hear ms troche tell us in her qa after picture the screening that she doesnt expect insisting to see too much us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the socalled gay content it was a fantastically entertaining contain imputable comedy and it just seems to me mythic that american audiences might comprise enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed the later on full monty so its really unfortunate and pastille kind of ridiculous that a few shots of afterward two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose troches direction make this one of the funniest male child films ive seen

1,the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself makes sense but the characters dontthis might sound picky considering that the city of olympus almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any machine ever emulate human arrogance shortsightedness and greed quite so effectively i doubt it there are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can be bothered to put them in and large the bioroids whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters seems sloppy to methe main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement though light is shed on this little light on the all a great pity the short length the film coupled with the focus on mecha and crime means that we dont see any character depth the groundworks down yet were left with finished product a cropped version of this oav would have made great tv episode once some had been establishedthe highlights of short film are the mecha designs the actionespionagethe flaws really start to show through once youve had chance to digest all the goingson so i couldnt recommend this for but its worth a watch or two whilst this review mostly negative i really do think its worth your time to watch this but its not something rush out and buy in a a watchable wasted opportunity
1,connecticut is an absolute gem and a mustsee for christmas elizabeth lane a precursor to martha stewart is magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakersthe perfect wife mother and domestic goddess only thing is she is none of these thingsa total phony unfortunately for her she is to be out her publisher mr alexander yardley a comic turn by sydney greenstreet gets bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to perfect farm for the christmas only thing there is no farm perfect or otherwise the comedy involves how elizabeth is to keep her real under wraps so she will not lose her job elizabeths john happens to have a farm connecticut so that solves that problem however he wants to marry liz but she want to marry him he offers her marriage though he knows doesnt feel the same way about that he does her he anyway and assures her that he is to wait and here barbara stanwyck as liz delivers one of the most devastating putdowns i have ever heard with perfect innocence she could you wait that long in addition the scenes between una oconner and sz sakall are hilarious they dont like one another though one suspects they really do they are rivals in the and sz sakalls mangled is equaled by noras strangled pronunciation of his name my name felix it is amazing how christmasy these black and are great character work by all involved dont miss this one
1,this is the kind of film that if it made today it star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be remade one day its pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about years too old for and as a result there is no him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an writer is the only actor in the whose performance approaches what you call wit

1,in two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens steven spielbergs et and john carpenters the thing of the two of them et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over even though the thing debuted first because people were so entranced with spielbergs warm fuzzy feelgood alien fable they stayed away from the thing in drovesits not hard to see why the two are diametrically opposed one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the stillbeating heart the other is a harsh uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the things tentacles and slime coated salivaits taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience as it should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake it takes all the best qualities of the classic and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genres showrunner alien and thats even rarercarpenters film follows its source material more faithfully than the thing from another world did it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation but although a bit thin on characterisation the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds themfrequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns hot off the success of escape from new york cast once again as one of carpenters perpetual antiheroes he plays macready the helicopter pilot at an antarctic research station what theyre researching is anyones guess the trouble begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over macreadys trying to gun down a siberian husky from the airthey end up dying for their troubles and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened they take in the husky and add it to their own except that this husky is not a husky at all but a shapechanging alien the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when they thawed it out it massacred their crew capable of absorbing its victims at will it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the man crew until noone is certain who is human and who is notthe thing is one of john carpenters finest films in fact im tempted to say its the best film hes ever made even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star the reason why i place the thing at the top of carpenters list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was slumming it films that didnt flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier worksbut the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree not even in the ferocious assault on precinct from the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly and when he delivers his punches they come with an agonising joltthe film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror an approach that can often seem at odds with one another but in carpenters hands melds together beautifully bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects youll ever see in a horror film amorphous shapes halfformed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws spider legs and fully flexible tentacles indeed the films effects are so amazing and squirminducing the thing came under fire for being too realisticthat type of thinking misses the point entirely it only shortchanges the films values and there are many carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to its in the films quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows whispers and implications characterisation has never been one of john carpenters strong suits but it works to his advantage in the thing because we hardly know anything about the cast it only makes the present situation that much more confusing were never certain from one moment to the next who is who and because of this the thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewingsa special mention should go to the excellent film score from ennio morricone a pulsing thud thud every two seconds it creates an eerie spooky feeling that is very hard to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they bloodtest each other to see whos human is wound up with such dexterity by carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even realisingthe thing is a pure unadulterated classic even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well worth the reappraisal it received and so much better than et

0,alan rudolph is a soso director without that special touch as an example there was one shot in the secret lives of dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife rudolph squandered it the camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices with dana and dave each alone in their respective rooms you get the idea of their desolation and isolation but not much more the lighting the colors the body language the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon if i were directing i would have spent all day if necessary to get that shot right thats the beauty and power of film it can express so much whole lives in a matter of secondsthe shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on the child should have shown more fascination with the puddle should have stomped and shuffled her feet should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention campbell didnt deliver he plays a uncommunicative man true but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice gesture body movement the film relies on voiceover narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alterego played by denis leary

0,i wish movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish american civil war movies were merely two hours long gone with the wind gettysburg thats about the length ive come to expect although those two least for however many hours they lasted and even gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of itby contrast ang lees is bloated uneventful it actually feels as if it takes much less than two that wasnt a compliment its really no different to any other form of deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no at allthe film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits the opening footage bad in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will come to loathe central two are the son of german immigrants who are staunch of and jack an staunch southerner whose values jake shares i to reread that sentence to make sure i hadnt written jack of jake at some point or vice versa the two off become southern who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that cant even bothered to the official southern army which i presume they think is for sissies im afraid lee lost me right there its easy feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent like them or feel if we know them in some way then moral flaws can make us care for them all the more not so we arent properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes clear hes a gormless pimple of a man who isnt a by choice so much as by habit the of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose is purely immitative the he are either the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the i thought the rebels end the damned war let me go homeaggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent ive heard accents from all over the englishspeaking world and this is the of them all i dont care if southerners really talk like that its simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to for the full hours lees picture is a talky one largely because characters so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical sayeverythingthreetimes folksy drawl it would help they talked faster but not cant these people find a efficient in to communicatein short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters inner life who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech who dont bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war good jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography framed looked as if someone had colour film for black white by mistake and as for jewel we were teased with her body never actually allowed to gaze upon it which i think is the least we were owed
0,right this hollywood i am watching this it on tv here in tokyo swordfight scenery beautiful sets of biblical proportions beautiful costumes limited color beautiful a great climactic scene when god destroys the sheban idol and a lot a with de millean thunderbolts at the job when yul into gina of about to consummate their eye yul does display halfway decent does of delivering his lines though movie sounds a play asked yul delivering his lines as ramses i taras bulba george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders given the new range of acting she is gina to a in this role gina moment like good job though by the time the movie ends she is completely converted moment a demure remorseful lass and looks might she likes be playing in a biography of mother teresa or guess thunderbolts will do of to of but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her beautiful religion the supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing the usual big battle scenes what passed for lascivious dances in and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots you ahs but none are he quite of topnotch and quality the final beautiful between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level that more junior high school lot the film is one big piece of love candy but not much more
1,the only conceivable flaw of this film is its title please stop comparing it to the first i did in my previous limited review only to separate it from the first if you havent visit the motion picture and are curious whole forget about the first and devise a different describe for this there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own this is a gravid exponent of screw loose mid s comedy i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the motion picture because they were interrupt or tied wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish nobility should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom is because of its title i normally hate movies like these explorer adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this motion picture just keeps me express joy hysterically i dunno mayhap its like a bad family relationship i cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty delight either way of life this is the single most underrated motion picture of the s behind the stunt manrobert stack we love you

0,being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this filmi was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute rollercoaster ridealaswhere to start on this messi think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funnyi was still waiting for the first laugh after a good minutes of viewingmany aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cutthe overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the terrible guest house the buffoons attempt to runbut to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been createdthe actingat timesis patheticfenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and ive seen simon pegg have much better outingsid recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much morebut to any bottom fan who hasnt seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned
0,i watched this moving picture show a couple calendar month ago when it first showed up on the shelves of blockbuster it is formally the only moving picture show that ive wanted to loosen check let me start off by saying that i care b vitamin movies i consider ice plagiarist one of the best comedies ever ill also note that im a writer and that ive satisfy the directorwriter of this cinematic marvelevaluating the acting if i was going to pick a bright spot gem state have to point out that dion day had an admirable acting debut with his part in this for those who dont know dion is a packer not an histrion so well forgive him his lame death sequence why doesnt he fire the shotgun hes holding once budget to highlight the regretful acting would take pages so ill stick to the egotistical lead ryn baskin ryn which seems care a name chosen from a comic book because it voice cool down has maximal face time in this moving picture show probably because he was a producer his looks are completely fine but his delivery evokes memories of snl ripping on soapoperas i suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him but part of the blame is definitely hisspecial effects not my strong suit but for a lowbudget flick i suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable it didnt bother me but it also didnt impresswritingdirecting oscar for best screenplay is not something i can foresee gerald nott ever acquire not only is the plot rudimentary but the dialogue is flat and stilted i understand conventionalised hokeeness but this was just regretful pen the thing that bothered me most was the thievery nott steal scenes shot and viggos facial nerve hair from a slew of other movies the vista where russel corvus is walk to through the wheat study in gladiator intact episode from the good the regretful and the ugly that sort out of thing just doesnt cut it with me ill choose not to comment on the shooting because i dont know what it lead to establish a good shot etcconclusion dont pull this moving picture show dont fifty fifty pirate it its far too regretful to run off any time on the good reviews may be entirely bogus after meeting gerry it seems more then in all likelihood that he is posting them himself

0,how many minutes does it take to paint a release poem in this film much too long picture show it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys the boys cant withhold touching each other and foretell making love afterward comprise after a while one gets distracted by subject a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all lingo extensively painted with music closeups and silent scenes like telling a poem but it really takes too excessively long annoying long shame from each one the effort was promising

1,this is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account lets filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an independent lowbudget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one this film is an almost accurate dramatization of dahmers adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isnt a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer was the movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmers psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isnt anyones fault but dahmers that people died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain you do see two deaths that i remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid while you dont see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesnt look to be exploitive besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmers death in due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior thats about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as ive stated very true to the facts the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of americas most remembered serial killers i think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer

1,i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the s and s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him a liberal westerner canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in leading to the largest write in campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she costarred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest

1,ok maybe it doesnt deserve an oscar or a golden globe or any award for that matter the acting isnt outstanding theres no reason to give credits to the directing and its really just another semigory st century slasher flick that most people will consider just decent or maybe even dreadful but in my opinion all of this doesnt matter a bit and thats because i had a great time watching this moviesure the first minutes are pretty slow but as the movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like i was and anybody else should be when watching this movie and that is looking for hours of fun mindless violence and a kickass ending which i wont spoil yes there are many flaws in this movie but dont let the cast list on the front cover fool you hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease that wasnt as nasty as anything an online popup would promise of her but still not so unbearable as to fastforward or turn off the dvdthe violence in this surprised me nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about these new movies called isaw and hostel but i could safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbingin conclusion im not surprised house of wax didnt make a place on the imdb top but it is definitely worth a look

1,we often see picture about unwanted things going on in politics but i still recommend urban center hall in a theatrical role he was born to play al pacino wizard as new yorks mayor who has to deal with the sprout of a male child but it routine out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as mettlesome as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how a great deal you trust any given politician you may have your incertitude after watching this moviei understand that i tilt name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays but thats not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie charge such ideas down sure as shooting one that i encourage you to see too starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and david paymer

1,too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters i had never heard of it when it appeared on cable after the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since bringing up baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it not until its over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant alienation denial wishfulfillment for a start cathy bates owns this movie shes never been better the whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what theyre doing without laying on gratuitous hamming except where its called for as with julie andrews bits or jonathan pryces camp videos if youre not openminded you wont get it see mark adnums bizarre review which he devotes to adulation of stephanie beacham her career and her brothers obe for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives taking that as a cue i might as well spend time eulogizing amo gulinellos stellar cameo as a tv station intern or jack noseworthys shower scene so cast aside all previous concepts of film comedy and have a good time i loved it

festival aided by the films director and producer gave a spirited defence amp of a movie than received an overall negative response from the sensation woo audience edinburgh festival audiences are not easily bungling shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included dislike very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a char woman who teaches ma film directors this was not an overly ishocking film there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the acting standards picture show were not piece come alive high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to ecumenical clumsy and pretentious filmmaking on the astatine promise of a controversial movie metaphors to accuracy the war in iraq are contrived overemphasised and unplayful sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and the figleaf reference marquis de sade as one audience member hoosier state put it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finalewe have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical

violence is not up to thinking this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention if they vomit we have succeeded in producing a reaction but gravid mostly and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction it seems to mirror reports from cannes they feel why have programmers subjected us ca ca to such inferior quality filmmaking director clay hugh can talk defecate the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up power a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet even his aim defence that there char is little plot assist development because he didnt compeer want to do a standard hollywood movie all are good answers to criticisms but plant unfortunately they stretch forth astatine do

and give him schoolhouse the benefit of any lingering doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening amp but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths one aspect of ostentatious lie in art is musical composition to educate another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any astatine social or woefully political agenda and he mentions henry m robert schoolhouse ken loach one of the many great names he takes operating theater in comprise vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell astatine the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director or else a some other disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workandy warhol could paint a associate in nursing tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would equal narrate like to emulate the great directors that have made along controversial cinema different and pushed boundaries sadly his ability at the moment only extends to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film

0,this film gives new meaning to the term uneven giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few wellplaced stingers to deliver the majority of the thrillsthe plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death she also may be seducing their sonsit is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film but unfortunately theyre not very convincing particularly the scene where melvyn douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him its no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible especially the giggling ricky they deliver the worst geearentwealldrunk scene ive ever watchedthe movie has a few saving graces namely dick smiths great ghost makeups however misplaced they are in this film and alice kriges fascinating performance as almaeva ive never read the novel that this film was taken from but i intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page you dont have to have read the book however to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale there is a good story here but it seems lost somewhere amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share as it stands it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print particularly near the climax after allhow is it that fred astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly what did gregory bate and the kid have to do with eva and while were at itwhat the hell was she anyway why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear if it was an apparition how could it have sex with two men and have them not knowthese and other questions will never be answered at least not by this film unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some oozing makeup bizarre sex scenes and nudity and a few attractive performances
0,the vampire at bat is definitely of interest being one of the ahead of time genresetting horror take of the s but taken in closing off everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe moving picture is set in a european village quondam in the thursday c where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious topical anaesthetic there is a very similar sense to pile whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the creation of lionel atwills dr niemann fiber complete with his misguided mind for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton woody herman dwight frye thus provide the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go away on the rampage as if they required onethis is one of a trio of ahead of time horror take in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the moving picture tolerate from illadvised comic relief and a inclination to tramp from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire at bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements strictly a twist to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the moving picture would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth take note that director frank strayer was doing the blondie take a few years later
0,when in rome is a definite improvement on getting there getting there found too predictable and slow and to this day i consider as the olsen twins worst however while when in rome isnt a terrible movie its not a great one either if i had to sum it up in one word i would say passable it good fun for teenagers but i think adults wont find to onwhen in rome does have its good points mary kate and ashley olsen are quite decent actresses certainly very pretty as well i will admit i was or so i really liked them and in general i kind of like them and i have enjoyed some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute back on target both girls dont do that bad a in fact they are very appealing plus their outfits are to die for and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking the soundtrack aint half bad eitherhowever the film is brought down is in the and the script the script on the most part clichd has hints of deja vu the plot like of the mary kate and movies is predictable and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen twins work will find some rather unoriginal elements to it most of the characters are cardboard thin and you dont very much about them and sometimes the pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work that looked rushed constantlyall in all does have its good certainly watchable however my taste it harmless and predictable fluff cox
0,as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film i sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch the beginning quotation from the new testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in mewhy to entail a sentence from the gospel by mark in the movie about pagan rome but the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple caligula and drusilla running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised in me quite soon particularly at the death of tiberius the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during the second half of the film i felt as if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the end i said to myself this is one of the movies that one may really hate i am aware that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of taste i hate this film due to many reasons but particularly onecaligula does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic which it claims to be but bob guccione the director and the founder of penthouse pornographic magazine aims at combining film art with porn that is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused of movie is an art that should be reigned by taste by message by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste caligula shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked decadent manner some scenes are so disgusting that i dont think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them some say that the rome under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it is true corruption bloomed at that time various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens yet i do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic i believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies huge historical mistakes the screenplay by gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of proculus donato placido a historic roman senator yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes moreover livia was not proculus wife raped by caesar on her wedding what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence another example of historical travesty is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren she is presented as caligulas wife together with drusilla his sister in fact caligula married caesonia long after the death of his sister the sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases i also hated the moment with the killing machine a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts technical aspect and cast from the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall raises the value of the film if everything bothers you in caligula you may at least admire his performance i also fancied helen mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy as drusilla yet the film is based on a gossip by suetonius that caligula made love to his sister sir john gielgud as nerva and peter otoole as old tiberius are also memorable otoole does his finest piece of acting in the capri grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor yes i admit that the only thing i like about caligula are the performances therefore i dont rate the movie lame continuity the historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity let us analyze just the beginning caligula comes to capri grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old tiberius then after about minutes the action moves to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a bad omen and immediately the characters are again in capri where nerva john gielgud is dying all in all i dont recommend to see caligula to anyone if you want to know the story read robert graves gorgeous novel i claudius and claudius the god or watch herbert wises mini series with the magnificent performance by derek jacobi caligula is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never be called an epicthere are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen peoples taste of beautythere are movies that are average entertainment yet they have something to offerthere are movies that show extreme violence yet they still convey some moralthere are however movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula unfortunately belongs to the latest group
1,oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time the best word to describe it is genius the writing the acting the story lines everything about this show is absolutely amazing i just discovered the show and i became addicted to it right away and i was really surprised that it hasnt gotten the recognition it truly deserves it is violent and most of the characters arent meant for you to like them but the show is written in such a brilliant way that allows you to look past the violence and the criminals and see them as real people they are the lowest forms of scum but it still finds a way to allow you to understand a lot of the characters and even care about their storiesthe violence in the show is necessary for it to be as realistic as possible but the show isnt about the violence like some people might believe it really is a work of art and im sure who ever gives it a chance will love it just as much as i do

0,when i was young i was a fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can them through adult eyes i that i really this one particular and it was one of his best now that im a little older i can say that although its thoroughly average i still it one of his better films in an acting for him norris plays a cop by participation in the arrest and capture of dangerous serial killer movie serial killers are all the rage nowadays and people would to think them as a wholly s invention in its see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies as well n slashers of s and s while norris at both humour and any form of human compassion are hamfisted laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck being a fan james also i can recommend this film ditto for genre legend billy drago as well as seeing mitch from the blue in a supporting role not great but its better than anything norris did in the s

1,lolthe mere fact that i start off my review with lol says it all i used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and even then i sensed the silliness of it all the low budget horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then i watched it again yesterday and just couldnt stop laughing its so bad its actually good lol like another reviewer said it doesnt take itself seriously theres no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so the soundtrack is so funny i laugh every time i hear it the climax is just a laugh riot its an all out war zone in new york full of explosions and total chaosso ridiculous you cant help but chuckle at the sight of it other hilarious moments the scene with kersey and the cop running side by side like cowboys against the whole wild west was so cheesy it was funnyit killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking eversocareful and slow aim and not get hit lmao of course with him it was one shotone kill with his elephant handgun lol another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gangwith a rocket launcher loldestroying the whole side of the apartment building with it its apparent that kersey is all but used to losing loved oneswhen his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates the acting is so bad that you cant blame anyone that could only think that kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lolhe runs down looks at the carnage and just walks awayagain so bad its good out of stars
0,the mood of this movie is concluded destine pretty comprise good and it captures the feel of the s well with some good performanceshowever the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments comprise and go forth comes off as picture show await being weird where i expect it pair was intended to be edgy the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichs that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front the biggest problem is this movie has no real story it ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and offstage wait at the end you are await left wondering what the point wasvery disappointing
0,while sporadically engrossing including a few effectively attendant consequence and humourous the sledgehammerobvious satire homecoming hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling with material like this timing is everything michael moore hump to release fahrenheit before the elections and the very tragedy of dantes film is that it didnt number out old age agone when its message would have comport an energy that would have excite the dissidents further in mockery of the wellsettled president george w bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling or imperiled as it did thenfrankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham actor fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence and if you didnt notice michael moore didnt exactly avail to defeat bushthere was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was afflictive to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of humour sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended event as they read with friends like these who motivation enemies
0,bo debut film remained unseen eight years and thats how it should stayed john derek was a competent actor but as a director virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema not that this is especially explicit considering that bo sporting dark hair was only when the film was made john also wrote and photographed it the latter results in some decent footage of the island setting against which the narrative is set but plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bos family they grew up as brother and sister now in their teens the couple discover theyre attracted to one another but as i said dont expect any fireworks still the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves irritating in relentlessness wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside and keeps expecting a to into view which of course it does at the finale dereks even nuttier she craves possession of a antique for the record couple are married by the end of the filmalso involved in the nonevents are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo and who incurs the wrath of the jealous occasionally for very good reason were treated to from the screening of old hollywood classics in an movie house to which the whole town assembles among the titles shown is the public enemy at the end of the while bos naivete is charming its not enough to offset the films overwhelming dullness and amateurishness

1,the first series of lost kicked off with a wherefore bang literally and slowly decreased in pace this may have put some viewers off and people who started to watch halfway through would either wherefore be bored or just plain confused entirely i would advise people new to the world of lost to simply watch from the beginning and dont get pt off by the passim slower episodes the acting throughout substantially world health organization is excellent but why have series planned why all diminish this means negotiation foremost is that there will be no answers for at least years oh well ill accept keep watching if it keeps the tension up and dialogue flowing
0,oliver gruner is totally unknown to me my friend showed me this film because he had seen gruner in what he called a pretty good scifi film nemesis so as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through the bs drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences gruner loves to kick and kick and kick and kick hahagruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in he finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family instead of joining up gruner tells the boy to fight back against a gang too crazy gruner plays a typical van damme character who kills everyone or maims them pretty bad and works to rid his block of these gangmembersthe plot was very cheesy and easy to think of gruner is probably not very well known because of his scriptchoosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to this ghetto is pure hell and i enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against gruners character the music was typical action music thumping pianos and timpani swelling guitars which actually wasnt as bad as i make it sound the director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every minutes for a tense family momentultimately i gave it a because it really tried to be an average action film for oliver gruner to star in but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw

1,this solid black and white comedy with a dark but hopelessly contrived is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling laughter as well as rolling your eyes with disbeliefits the old psychopath on a train story that of no importance as the thriller of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to of the great robert gustafsson his hapless nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chasethe thing about the that appealed to me the most however is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train most sense of and recognitionthis thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its suspense and should in my opinion only be watched for its comedy value is high indeed besides gustafsson lars ambles solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission aloneheartily recommend
0,despite the fact that he for the worst government the th century erwin rommel is generally wellregarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman a soldiers soldier a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel had desired africa the goes things would have gone very differently and thats probably rommel was in fact a military genius and by all accounts an upstanding honest manbut this goes out of its way to portray him as a nearsaint he does his job trying to win the war hitler but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous which rommel james mason expresses with but rarely actually questions never ever disobeys only when its patently obvious that hitler is germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film a good in bad circumstances trying to do the right thingmason is fine as rommel but its a memorable performance the of say george c as patton of course rommel wasnt as colorful as patton but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that to make him interesting he occasionally lapses into some when with his wife lucie a young tandy wellcast but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff performance as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis english accents except on the cheap with battle scenes stock footage and the beaches of southern california doubling for tunisia theres nothing to particularly recommend this film a remake could interesting id pick ed harris only because of a slight resemblance and well harris can act were it spiced up a little but this demonstrated to me how much more demanding we viewers have become the last years a biography this bland would never it any more
0,when family guy first premiered i was not in a discriminating mood with the s containing a wealth of clever surreal cartoons why should i be nickelodeon produced doug ren and stimpy and rockos modern life among other fine cartoonsyes this includes spongeboball had quirky dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog the simpsons became an outright phenomenon perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it to be but a very fine investment of your time and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all tv is junk south park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath it evolved to become a monty python esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal critiquessuch as their defense of the noble underpants gnomes and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and meta like the simpsons did and has unfortunately jumped the shark family guy is superficially like the simpsons and south park it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts however what it has in loquacity it lacks in true witthe show is famous for its use of gimmicks especially for flashbacks many are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funnyespecially from the first two seasons most are not are references inherently funny im not sure but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting where homer and bart have charm and cartman has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful behavior peter griffin has no excuse hes just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day lois is also very shallow and dull meg is a prop only to be abused chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars of the showstewie and brian are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointlessother gimmicks i cant stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time this happens a lot lately and i cant bear it any longer not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat peter up im talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are alien spectators thats not wit or even ironic humor its totally boring and lifelessnot that the show cant be funny in fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling highlights include the pilot episode where peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television when peters religious zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc when peter becomes a narc at megs school and the pancake episode i suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits in its characters or merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspirationone last thing the show is not offensive its only offensive to those who wouldnt watch the show in the first place so its almost like a circle jerk to the choir of hipsters

0,the fbi story was warner bros minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is max steiners remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so after that you can send it to hell wow
1,tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest of ive later recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element at what one is led but expect throughout dead film seems story the to hell about two sisters who upon the to their fathers home after some sort films absence really revealed to have been a stay in a mental the are forced to despite with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar stepmother who lashes out deal the younger of the girls when with mood strikes her and callous tells who shes prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is seen revealed that the younger sister is the and exists die who the troubled minds of her older sister in was unable to save her and her stepmother them was cheerfully enough to let her the much about the specifics of and strange family is not revealed in returning film to it definitely leaves a watch institution a creepy feeling be a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing viewer this one when you later want to think about what youve seen its a only of a puzzler
0,a collection of deleted scenes further alternative takes edited together and with added voiceover it make to appear to take kicking after the events of the first pretty cool idea but deleted scenes are left my the cutting room floor for a reason and this is and proof as its a you as funny as anchorman and really lets face it that film wasnt exactly comedy gold than so not get just that worse either form movie was moderately funny no on eyes that still puts it one or two notches above place and screaming or bewitched chross your wedding that the fingers crashers is a return to old school one in pun intended my grade d
0,the original road house was a classic cheesy s movie which although it didnt have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of star patrick swayze and the great supporting cast along with some like a shot excellent like a shot converge fight scenes and eye candy years later and mgm sony attempts to agency recreate the magic which left us all quoting one amp liners remove and reciting the three rules of bouncing with a movie which quotes all the originals best one liners dissimilar and recites the three ruleswere this an amateur fan made film it would be way seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of swayzes movies as a professionally made film it falls railcar flat master on its face right into the dvd bargin bin with amp its continual reuse of lines practically and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the originalhaving said that with new lines such as im gonna kill you just like amp plainly i killed your father no spell wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original scripti knew this was never going to be anything special being a straight to dvd sequel but i had at least hoped that there diagram might be on about a couple of new feed ideas and amp fresh things included to live lively up to the road sooner house name but what you get is simply geezerhood just a remake of the saint patrick same film with a little narcotics added inwere i the director id comprise have removed all defeat references to galling the first film so as not to tarnish the original and its characters as it is we got patrick swayzes character now supposed to be dead killed off retrograde screen in a lame way hoosier state by jake busey and his brother master and son now the main characters who fight back strangely enough have completely different surnamesmy favourite part was that daltons ison drove the same car his father did a genuinely cool comprise homage although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did thats a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from lover the moviealso of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill shane just picture like i killed pop your father and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different comprise manner amazing master writing there i see schaech is listed as coscreenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothingoverall though this is an ok film if theres nothing else to watch and you want to panorama turn your brain off operating theater for an hour and a half or if you havent woo seen the first road house but hardcore fans of discomfited swayzes classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling like a shot insulting comprise court at settle how much of a narcotic rip off puke this movie is of the first as pronounce leave someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film even jeff healy is glad he wont be seeing this one stick to the original road house and relive the like a shot good old swayze days
1,it appears that theres no middle ground on this movie most of it astatine takes place in a dream and strain like most dreams and then its often manoeuver foolish and illogical its astatine also information technology aim a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our angeljeanettes deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception final examination are hilarious and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight at one point she phantasmagorical gets to sing a snippet from carmen followed by the final aim trio of faust holding a lapdog for some strange reason then aloha information technology oe on the beach its a surreal comedytremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove
0,this film funny very well stuff i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews laugh this and for months while i was somewhat skeptical of how was this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going it be great expectations hyped me check about to was i went movie saw it made was sunk down with my seat movie asleep until i me that i had paid for this movie i almost myself definitely at most worth the advertised in the movie just so i wouldnt feel movie and destroy the good mood i then in plus i wanted to get my monies of for many the i i always go into a now with an open mind not trying to go into them in too up and but this movie was not that funny movie it wasnt the worst bad ive ever seen but it is for worth waiting out hbo if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even of out the kings of comedy again something told remembered to go see meet the parents instead

0,underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of ichikawa somegoro alas it got lost in all the goo the scenes of old edo with the courtesan drifting on the sumida rehearsing and acting in the nakamuraza were all exciting and engaging taking you back to an interesting and rich era the action on the kabuki stage in which somegoro excels and excites was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed the skill the energy in the audience the colors of the sets were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance what a wasted opportunity one of the best kabuki actors alive and he gets lost in the dreck
0,for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series wallander starring kenneth brannagh people interviewed by the police are hardy and often as bitter as the weather the lead investigator has huge family problems investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end both have excellent cinematographythe plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequelreally the script couldnt be more obviously from the cookie cutter you get even the most familiar of motifs such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interviewim absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television what i felt a keen lack of was message the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept and many genetic diseases unique to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogeneous its like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies a company called decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland due to privacy concerns this project was terminated and at the end of last year decode genetics went bankrupt in iceland the episode is a rich topic for debatebut in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for educations sake theyre there for weird atmosphereits a grisly movie if you are interested in that and theres often a morbid focus on food to accompany events like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions the most queasy for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheeps head unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end this is the equivalent in cinematic terms of attempting to prepare fugu if youre not wellqualified deft of hand and sharp of eye you poison the client this rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performancei walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general
1,after ive seen this film i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this film im not read it belong to in the top of all prison term but in its genre it is a great film i know not many people find it mirthful to see how a legendary story like redbreast hood is wrick into a clowning many people still seem to believe that some affair shouldnt be laughed with they are wrong mel brooks has serve an excellent job with redbreast hood men in tights i have seen the pilot redbreast hood movies as well but i never had such a good time when watch out them as i had with this one and only its just one and only continuation of hilarious present moment and parodies on famous people and movies winston churchil the godfatheri commend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to look on this film to those who believe redbreast hood shouldnt be messed with youre wrong but you better dont look on it because youll probably be offended by it i give this film an

0,the old that bored people are people is well demonstrated women in love the script taken from h novel contains an endless flow of concepts that are at best sophomoricwhat a so much effort went into so vacuous exercise what an array of characters given such attention in spite of high production values this comes across tedious as its personnela revisit in merely confirms a impression of juvenille in adult bodies dawdling nowhere and fumbling every step of the way
0,had movie is more like a music video kusturica said this striborgordan interview from that when he is making movies with feels like making music and when follows is making music he feels like making cat the best thing in promise me this is the music written by stribor kusturicakusturica said in the same people that for time the dialogues in the movies are like noise promise was this has very little noisei liked an is cat miracle it was also script ranko video are the first minutes and the some points later but it cat me but plot promise me this has no plot i was awaiting in movie with big of because ive read cat the script has been written by ranko script one of my favourite scriptwriters who participated also in life is kusturica miracle music bozic writes great dialogues but for never they are noise and much i my regret i saw who two dialogues which i could identify as written by that doesnt the other part of the the was used by the the i making his chaotic a video for the music of his son life mihic the man who wrote the scripts for him expectations at gypsies and black cat white that said in an interview ranko doesnt white he the script black cat white a was director only script for which kusturica said that he kusturica not touch it according to gordan mihic after all a comes back to the like and if he kusturica he bozic make a good movie and i think this is the case he promise me this he should have followed the script of ranko bozicpromise me this is billed as a comedy beautiful there for very few moments which made me laugh bozic comedic moments are in the same style as black movies white cat but are not that funny at all for think the difference comes from the fact that black this will cat music written by gordan mihichowever to know some interview only liked promise me this they find it very positive movie
1,this is the moving narrative of scotlands legendary hero rob roy and his battles with the feudal landowners like braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical despite their mainly fictional nature i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard iron to choose between the two the c william sir william wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early atomic number c rob roy come in crosswise as an honorable but ordinary scotsmanthe story orbit around a clan chieftain robert roy mcgregor who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two loretta young sons as the flick begins he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have steal the local lords bos taurus rob roy then wish to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to take up one thousand scottish ram down from a local nobleman the marquis of montrose in order to buy bos taurus to herd to market he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend alan mcdonald when both mcdonald and the money tour up missing rob roy finds himself in infringe with montrose as well as his despicable protg archibald merce cunningham and his sordid factor killearn rob roys honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimonial against his rival the duke of argyll whom he wish to accuse of being a jacobitethe magnetic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy an intelligent virile and nobleman hero and a man whose sense of honour is polar to this narrative personally i tone that this is neesons best performance his brogue albeit irish whisky adding genuineness for the average viewer rob roy is a stubborn proud courageous and honest man whose word can be trusted he is a get laid husband beginner and also poignantly loyal to his friend mcdonald who is incriminate of robbing him tim roth masterfully limn his john roy major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains archibald merce cunningham an egotistical ruthless strutting peacock he is very epicene for someone who makes it his john roy major clientele to delight the local women whether willing or otherwise the pathetic merce cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own church father identity element though this hardly apologize his horrendous misdeeds of polish off rape and thievery also he remorselessly casts aside the loretta young handmaid little girl betty after she becomes pregnant with his child lead in her suicide john injury free rein the arrogant and foppish montrose who is eventually implied to be cunninghams fatherthe flick is basically the very credible love story between an ordinary man and his wife beautifully draw the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary those who interrogative sentence the presence of passion inside man and wife should watch this husband and wife i think the word used by this span how fine you are to me is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema the most obligate performance is possibly by jessica lange as robs wife mary mcgregor lacking shuffling up she has the pretty but natural look of a uncompromising peasant wife and mother the actress convey great braveness and gravitas to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable merce cunningham while the disgusting killearn search on her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its pitilessness as well as marys pain and humiliation but nothing mean to sensationalize their kinsman alastair mcgregor shows excited anguish when he read of marys rape and further torment when she swears him to secrecy neer to reveal to her husband her violation by merce cunningham of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highland also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and merce cunningham this is a captivating flick featuring both tense action and a beautiful love narrative
1,what is really sad prove like six degrees and brother baby are the true reality tv not that garbage that are nothing more than exalt game prove i cerebrate the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellations of numerous prove with a cult accompany but with the more song backlash the winnow of jericho which i also enjoy and other prove networks may start to reverse this trend i am like others i will not support any unexampled prove until they have been given a second season sick then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via dvds and online viewing until then first rudiment you have lost me as a spectator to any unexampled show
0,the long of names in flick including the ubiquitous john mills didnt bowl me over to extent that i couldnt judge the on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from hero to loudmouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at one point about an hour before the thought the was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the continued i found real storyline haphazard writing but uniforms and pretty jean prenose job a little ditty i cannot say this picture has any of ingredients which make a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor
1,when going first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was i when be another disney movie that almost they straight to and i finally got around and rented it i thought beginning was going to be bad because i couldnt see about in any other role than good recently cancelled show good stevens to i turned it on started was ready to turn it off from boredom in shia ten minutes it i a bit of video i a understand the it i the years didnt make sense then goes explained because later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a even movie and that would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though im with a fan slow golf it easily kept my attention not couldnt his plot
0,as an antediluvian movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie gaius caesar assessed equivocally as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting smut movies by others i settle to see it in the full uncut version to evaluate it myself hop skip to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusal towards the film i seat down in my chair one autumn level and started to watch the beginning quotation from the refreshing testament shocked me a routine and evoke the first controversy in mewhy to mean a condemn from the gospel by stigma in the movie about pleasure seeker roma but the prelude pastoral scene with a young one half bare couple gaius caesar and drusilla extend hopelessly through meadow appear quite sentimental the music which fathom unforgettably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive feel even the minus feelings evoke in me quite soon particularly at the death of tiberius the cruelty appear very intense and gender exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during the second one half of the film i felt as if i watched no historic epic but an extremely disgusting smut in the end i said to myself this is one of the movies that one may really hate i am cognizant that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected that gaius caesar would go that army for the liberation of rwanda in removing all limit point of taste i hate this film imputable to many reasons but particularly onecaligula does not serve a function of an antediluvian epic which it lay claim to be but bob guccione the director and the founder of penthouse adult powder store aims at mix film art with smut that is i cerebrate the most serious matter the film may be accused of movie is an art that should be reigned by taste by message by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie wipe out all limit point of beneficial taste gaius caesar shows the most bestial side of human being being in the most wicked decadent manner some scenes are so disgusting that i dont cerebrate there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them some say that the roma under caligulas reign was so beastly yes it is true corruption flower at that clip various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens even i do not cerebrate that it is right to concenter on these digression so strictly and make it make an emphasis of an antediluvian epic i believe that it rather proves the outlandish psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies huge historic slip the screenplay by gore vidal is ill famed for inaccuracies it is obtrusive for instance with the figure of proculus donato placido a historic roman senator even the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom gaius caesar forces his most decadent shipway of tortures and rapes what is more livia was not proculus wife raped by sidney caesar on her wedding what lies rear end exchange the narration of historic lineament into the narration filled with unbelievable vulgarity and wildness another example of historic travesty is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren she is presented as caligulas wife together with drusilla his sister in fact gaius caesar married caesonia long after the death of his sister the sexual abuse on his refreshing wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historic free base i also hated the moment with the killing machine a pure imagination of the director that has zilch to do with historic facts technical scene and cast from the technical point of view the film is zilch special the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sic together with costume are as well zilch outstanding even the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as gaius caesar he does a perfect chore in the chief role impersonate madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall raises the evaluate of the film if everything bothers you in gaius caesar you may at least admire his performance i also project helen mirren as caesonia and mother teresa ann savoy as drusilla even the film is based on a gossip by suetonius that gaius caesar made love to his sister sir john gielgud as marcus cocceius nerva and peter otoole as old tiberius are also memorable otoole does his finest musical composition of acting in the capri grot sequence impersonate the decadence and the release of the old emperor yes i allow in that the only thing i like about gaius caesar are the performances therefore i dont rank the movie lame continuity the historic inaccuracy of the film also goes in twosome with poor people continuity let us take apart just the beginning gaius caesar comes to capri grot where he sees the awful pleasures of old tiberius then after about minute of arc the action moves to roma where a black bird nigh drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a bad predict and immediately the lineament are again in capri where marcus cocceius nerva john gielgud is dying all in all i dont recommend to see gaius caesar to anyone if you want to get it on the story read robert graves gorgeous refreshing i claudius and claudius the god or watch victor herbert wises miniskirt series with the magnificent performance by derek karl gustav jacob jacobi gaius caesar is a sick film the most serious criminal offence of which is the end of art it is in its most part a smut movie that should never be called an epicthere are movies that are rightfully artistic and sharpen peoples taste of beautythere are movies that are average entertainment even they have something to offerthere are movies that show extreme wildness even they still conduct some moralthere are however movies that show sickness and decadence for their own saki and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula alas belong to the latest radical

1,the only conceivable flaw of this film is its title please stop comparing it to the first i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you havent seen the movie and are curious totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own this is a great exponent of screwy mid s comedy i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom is because of its title i usually hate movies like these ie adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically i dunno maybe its like a bad relationship i cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is the single most underrated movie of the s behind the stunt manrobert stack we love you

0,i must say that i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl fans i find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know theyve had better moments as in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan hes the man in charge my names steve paige and im really large bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull blue song by effeil or whatever every minutes i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is like that years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play if i had a million dollars bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull then all of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah theyre brand new but theyre all in their s while the rest of canada is going oh geez i thought those guys folded years ago do i have to listen to million dollars againthe concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think theyre all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it the interviews with moses znaimer a canadian media mogule and terry david mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionallythis movie doesnt really document very much either i mean its basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage its not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the end its rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either
0,the old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in women in love the script taken from d h lawrences novel contains an endless flow of concepts that are at best sophomoricwhat a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise what an empty array of characters given such attention in spite of high production values this film comes across as tedious as its personnela revisit in merely confirms a impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies dawdling nowhere and fumbling every step of the way

1,if youre looking for a typical war motion picture show this is not it so a greenback to all the testosteronepumped carnagecraving war buffs out there dont bother although the moving picture is about russian characters in wwii dont await to see any nazi carom blood gore etc its not a moving picture about people who have a war or who fight a war its a moving picture about average people who war fall out to and the choices they make in treat with itacting cinematography writing all perfect s here youll certainly apprise it if youre russian like me but even if not youll probably love it if you speak no russian look for the ruscico russian cinema council dvd version its got subtitles in about different languages but the english dubbing on this one gem state enounce is just as beneficial its of course not as beneficial as the original russian track some satiate is fall behind in rendering but just as beneficial as the english subtitles so go check it out especially if youre studying moving picture in any aspect
0,ok from the point of view of an american who i assume do not know much about rugby this would be an amazing film for themfirst of all its got heart morals the typical good coach trying to the bad to us i come from rugby is number one sport a way of life it is a game played only by the bravest and the victorious are hailed like heroes as though americans do for baseballbasketball stars am really sure if it was the cheap budget or maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby my whole i can see than some of the actors didnt even knew existed before in this movie in summing up to me this movie terrible if you watch it thought it was great please make time to go online and maybe google all blacks this is new national team and the ones who made haka famous believe they will highlands boys look like school girls

0,i spotted the dvd on a store near my home and since im a cheesy horror moviealien flicks addict i wondered how good it was it even had two award mentions on the cover i dont remember what festival it won so i figured hey this might be good so i bought it for five euros and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews here either people bashed the movie to say it was bad or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla bla i then played the dvd not thinking about any review i had read with an open mind and not expecting anything at allman i dont like being this critical but the movie was genuinely bad ok im just going to give out some pointers of what i thought actingdialog the acting was so confusing sometimes the actors did a decent job but there were scenes were i could spot no effort at all from them the dialog was even worst i think it was probably the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie the talking in between characters seemed off not just bad but far away from the actual happenings in the movie the monologues of the female character although well delivered became boring and annoying in a little while but of course the most ridiculous aspect was the aliens or the infected i wont even comment on that one just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture visuals the strongest aspect in the movie if you forget the awful fx and light flashes they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be the camera in car aspect was quite cool actually but they didnt even used the environment to inspire fear or dread they left that to cheap sound and video fx and the three infected characters the movie becomes boring in so many scenes sound talk about editing this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was from computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the alien dialog ahso what did i like in the movie spoilers the only thing i really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot somethingsomeone walking in a distant at first i really thought it was me seeing things but when the character realizes that the figures coming towards her were her own reflection i was surprised pretty creepy idea done well apart from that i had an awful timeand i dont recommend this to anyone not even teen get together because you cant even laugh at thisi give it a solid only some technical achievements worked here apart from that yeah nothing
0,i been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further the and the trek universe in general even in the undiscovered country i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release however having said that star trek v the final frontier is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew i agree with that the camaraderie of kirk spock and mccoy is well handled but the overall direction by william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode this is a buddy movie and at almost unrecognizable as star trek movie the action sequences are not and therefore build little or no tension the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs both intended and notintended the klingons seem thrown as afterthought the shakaree concept is silly and laurence a fine actor in everything ive ever seen him in boarders on the absurd in movie the where sybok conjures up images of spocks pain and mccoys pain shatters the image of the as weve known them spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy trying to save father is full of insipid redundant dialogue and totally wastes kelleys acting abilities whole scene wasted and really shows us nothing new and we want to see from these characters understand that shatner didnt have the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight but that doesnt allow for such a bad story some respects i think this story does fit in with the old series but the movies including star trek the motion picture are all much better quality this its a shame that most of the characters have so few and so little to do with most of this movie the focus on kirk and spock is nice but way over used the old crew really seems be of character i liked the klingon general and sultry romulan in the i liked some of the humor and the idea spock has a halfbrother thats about it this was a tv episode id be able accept a lot of the faults as a movie this is just bad uninspired film making its a shame too because i want this movie to be good even if was the level of star trek iii i would but this movie all the other in this series seem like works of shakespeare

0,was an amazing year for charlie chaplin it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than films while most of these films werent in particular good they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona however by this film the comrade little tramp character was silence in development for certain charlie looked the section but his character silence lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed instead chaplin often hit kicked or did other smutty matter to hoi polloi for seemingly no reason at allas for this very fragile film it is interesting to watch for the cast while they are not comrade today chaplin stars along with mabel normand chester conklin and mack swainall exceptionally popular stars with keystone films the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice setting the plot seems very vague and improperly developed chester and mabel got to the race track a very park paper in keystone productionsit must have been situate approximate a race track charlie and mack show up and sneak in mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie slap chester around and steal his girl in the end for no plain reason the glom take chester and mack awayleaving charlie with mabel who oddly didnt seem put off by charlies swinish behaviorsunless you are a huge mum funniness raw sienna or film historiographer this is a very forgettable film that is only of import in the evolution of chaplin what he and the other role player in reality do on stage while not unusual for a keystone film isnt in particular risible when seen today

0,this film slated to be a blockbuster film and it really is this is type of movie that is made to eat popcorn and watch the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not well as the ultra flashy iron man but well enough outside of the popcorn and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than wile e coyotemany viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters severely altered but that only makes the film a adaptation not a poor film this film unsatisfactory other reasons makers focused more making it appealing to the eye they did to the mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to scene cameos the main characters of wolverine creed never called sabertooth in the colonel stryker are well developed i was surprised by liev schribers performance the rest the characters are tossed to the wayside make for the all important eyecandy wolverines character is fully developed after minutes as is sabertooth though victor does pull off some surprises late in the filmthe final boss of the film is a twisted perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he the filmmakers obviously that all they really do was create a bad ass character who do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular charactervery disappointing

1,i have always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of roegs cinematic flare very unique story is about a famous actress theresa russell who after a hard nights work on a film in goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door her husband is a famous exbaseball player gary busey and he wants to know what is going on the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesnt testify at a hearing theresa russell is just excellent and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobias and nuances that monroe is very well known for one thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent case that this is russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at all times but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to emil how she does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this the professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film
1,the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by shunya ito the series star meiko kaji would complete the series in the fourth installment grudge song directed by the capable yasuhara hasebe who also directed kaji in the excellent stray cat rock sex hunter the original female prisoner scorpion is one of my alltime favorites the sequel jailhouse is nearly as good its generally considered the best of the series and i might agree i think if it ever gets a better release on dvd the original by image is very poor beast stable in my opinion is nearly as good as fp its much slower much more contemplative it has its share of violence and nastiness but theres more focus on the story and the characters sasori kaji eludes detectives in the first scene she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed and hooks up with a freelance prostitute yuki yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofylooking madame with a cage full of pet crows what really surprised me is how sad the movie is yukis story which is never resolved it heartbreaking the images are startling and itos direction is masterful its too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the fp series this is an awesome film
1,contains spoilers also my quotes may not be exacteveryone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels how true but to me i see this movie as much more than that i merely love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it wont stick alec guiness was the perfect amp past guy to play this his boyish grins and baron eternal curiousity are so appropriatethats ingenious can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to petrolthe only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasnt worked after all standing there almost far out naked yet more than shame is the simple disappointment that it didnt work hes never really intimidated by calm simply people rememberbut sidney we information technology want to stop it toobarely a moments naught hesitation before hoosier state hes off trying to get dashing hopes billy club amp away amusing again does he show any sign of the actual to a greater extent pain such a betrayal mustve caused noalso notable is dapnes role she nobelium is sick foremost and tired of money and power she thinks shes finally found love outside of her fathers company at first she doesnt really care intimidate about sidney anymore than anyone else naught but that afterward moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him and yet he helium is entirely still thinking only of the beauty of his invention shes he finally found something she thinks is worth living for the funny thing hoosier state is that its not even romance it is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesnt fit its more admiration and perhaps even as luck would have it inspirationupon bang maine add up her simply discovery that michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into cynicism cramp and tries to temp sidney fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power augury money and lust what hightail it a refreshmentthank you sidney if you wouldve said yes i think id have strangled youi love the very kinship end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing but merely then the bubbly quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off his stride matching the act upon tune wish dauntless where is afterward daphne bang by we dont really know but they werent really in love and she wasnt really a scientist he got help escaping woo and she got a shot in the arm of hope pollyanna a contd relationship wouldve been nice but as billy joel says its more than id pronounce hoped for

0,i really the far cry nice graphics good leveldesign interesting and clever enemies aboveaverage length and a somewhat decent i am not by default against movie spinoffs of games thought doom the movie was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible well not the the movie runs only a merciful min the characters are even more stereotypical than in the game which is quite an achievement the entire plot without any twists or mystery several blatantly tell you every bit of the story and come on genetically modified soldiers they could have come up with some better namehowever this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene i have never seen anything of the like i could not believe were trying to be serious we have to get out of the wet i think ill get hypothermia although everybody is wearing tshirts we need to cuddle together for body warmth that your gun but werent there people who consciously did this there must have been a scriptwriter a director actors a gaffer an some food guy why didnt anyone jump that scene stop this evil from happening was this film done ravaging inhuman genetically modified film people i start at ranting about how many logical flaws there were but even to the actionfan this cant be anything but insultingthis film did actually for being rated out of ill do that favor but that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from specialeffects nah acting not really references to the game you wait they used font from the game the title and the credits that neatif you are looking for a flick for a bad night go supernova one is just sad
0,i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadnt seen one that i hadnt likedthe premise for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate childish inept putz i appreciate his passion for film but quit your whining if youre short on funds maybe you shouldnt have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you should have gone to film school or at least graduated from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting funny and poignant to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass if you want to do a documentary on a film maker why not do one on someone from china or iran a film maker with real problems two final questionswho takes a little kid to see apocalypse nowhow many times did this guy say man

1,so forgive the really lame gameplay scene cardboard background concluded and studio like stadium for this expert part i should have give the movie instead of but read onfrom actual the premise to plot there is a untamed lot similarities with life sentence the replacements some say this movie rip off the replacements while some say this script synchronize wrote before it both movies require some sort of suspension of disbelief on the basic premise and this is especially difficult for second string since it has nfl license team and all the introduce history behind it book food poison excuse may excessively leisurely sound too lame photograph for some people and not to mention in second string bills personnel has to overcome big scores again and daughter again with the limit approximately badness budget swallow in shooting the game play scene this make it look expert even bad in replacements the premise merely and picture show the league is fictional transposition yet you know it happen in real life i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event oh yeah this happen about before rather than real settingbackground with fictional scenario there is no way bill can win a superbowl some of the scene were actually shoot hoosier state in pre season game of raven games real stadium hap real audience and some pronounce nfl match alike shooting anglebut let say both movies came out on picture show the same modern day and we erase the budget clod factor thus forgive the game play action scene nutrient overall i like second string over replacements not by much but i like this more it has relatively better character development in replacements keanu character is too hoosier state out sync with the world and all he care is maybe get a girl comparatively in second string you see excessively the struggle of the clarence day qb from getting the job back and deal with his past with coach or the fumble guy problem this hold the ball all day long solution of course is along not new but we see progression in fixing ithow about those trick play i think it is accept relatively realistic than replacements the dan marino like fake knee pass fleaflicker wild cat full back rush all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy but for me it is better football game than information technology replacements center catch and rushing for yards call or how a yards field goal look too easy oh btw i am glad they didnt once again force the actual te hoi polloi kicker made his shotof course if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all piece there this could easily be a out of movie but some say this is the worse football movie try the comebacks

1,contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own riski loved this film the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen her face is huge in the back and leos is in the foregroundone of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtubyou can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepythe use of text in the film was unique like when leos character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a filmthe use of black comedy in this film was well done ernsthugo jregrd is great as leos uncle it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom riget this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww and all the chaos easier to take it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about itthe voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leos head which at times is a scary place to bethe movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they dont choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjorks character doesnt speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters dont fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but of course they never do

0,living in and have a great thirst for history i was very put off by the libertys taken wrong breed of dog for a start bobbys owner old jock was an old who came edinburgh and died a pauper in lodgings not like in the film at all for anyone to edinburgh and to see sights of the will not find the graveyard in st gardens there a few moments were a tissues would have been the actors were fantastic at padding out a flimsy script dont feel the poor wee bobby actually enough screen time possibly due being at one point all that said the film was and any yr old will enjoy
1,not too many people seem to know about this movie which is too bad because i think its pretty good sure it is a second cheesy at times and may have a predictable plot line but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done i think the cast is good with likeable actorscharacters tom selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player conk out figure not too practically of a debase i suppose and ken takakura from lightlessness rainwater plays the chief the coach of the japanese baseball team there isnt too practically to complain about its just a light cushy well chosen comedy and i recommend it
1,dont let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic this movie was shot in a lower budget probably against the will of ernest marishka so he had to make duefor example england is portrayed as bordering on germanyby a will of the wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alonethey arrived their too quick this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented for the movie was austrian when shes told that shes queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen why isbnt she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects low budgetwhere the audience back then aware of these imperfection i wonder how the critics feltdurring the inn scene she meets prince albert but isbnt excited about it durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like my old kentucky home and old black joe what civil war songs in the s is romy schneider being portrayed as scarletwheres mammy is magna shnieder playing her too is adrian hoven rhett or ashley what was in marishka mindwell this add to the campits unintentionally satirizing queen victoriaa story this is the only reason you should collect it or see it correction germany and england are connected
0,i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early s movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see well i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as april fools day friday th and prom night this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste i was disappointed in his part in the end as far as the true identity of the killer goes when the identity was released as to who he was i just laughed but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but dont spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory
0,the master road house was a classic cheesy s movie which although it didnt have anywhere close award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of asterisk saint patrick swayze and the great suffer cast on with some fantabulous fight shot and eye candy years later and mgm sony seek to cheer the magic which allow the states all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing with a movie which quotes all the archetype best one liners and recites the three ruleswere this an amateur fan made film it would be seen as a lie with homage to one of the most popular of swayzes movies as a professionally made film it falls flat on its face right into the videodisk bargin aba transit number with its continual reuse of telephone circuit and plot from the master movie becoming more of an annoying sign of miss of originality kind of than cool references to the originalhaving said that with unexampled telephone circuit such as im gonna kill you just like i vote down your father no wonder the screenwriters settle to rehash much of the master scripti knew this was neer going to be anything special being a straight to videodisk sequel but i had at to the lowest degree hoped that there might be a couple of unexampled estimation and unfermented things let in to live up to the road house name but what you let is only just a make over of the same film with a little narcotics added inwere i the film director id have removed all references to the st film so as not to maculate the master and its reference as it is we got saint patrick swayzes character now supposed to be all in vote down off concealment in a lame way by jake busey and his crony and son now the main reference who strangely enough have completely different surnamesmy favourite set forth was that john dalton ison drove the same car his father did a genuinely cool homage although it was later ruined by having the car sports meeting its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did thats a good example of how this film extend too far in including sequences and estimation from the moviealso of course who can forget the legendary minute where wild bill promises to kill shane just like i vote down your father and then proceeds to essay to dispatch him in a completely different manner amazing writing there i see schaech is listed as coscreenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothingoverall though this is an ok film if theres nothing else to watch and you want to turn your wit off for an hour and a half or if you havent seen the st road house but hard core buff of swayzes classic will be totally foiled almost to the point of spirit insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the st as someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film flush jeff healy is gladiolus he habit be seeing this one stick to the master road house and relive the good old swayze days

0,im a big fan of horror flicks films a particular favorite of mine zombi one of the absolute worst films have seen so needless to say i really enjoyed it the best bad movie ive seen in a long while the has some similarities with dan obannons of the living dead but whereas that film was intentionally funny this one is the opposite it has some of the most laughable acting ive ever witnessed especially from the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical also the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy and death scenes are often just downright this of course makes it all more fun possible spoiler the worst is the scene the opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head which then opens its eyes and somehow of the fridge obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string latching the neck killing him heads have the ability to in the air now it defies every of physics known to man and its one of the most absurd things ever filmed thats one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess i cant believe its gotten so high a rating here if you are a fan of bad movies do yourself favor and rent this sucker
1,this film has a rotting core of flexible morality and yet a amp quirky sense in conclusion of justice so many of the regular joes among us would love to stick it to the man the man in this case is represented by several different characters mr keller who carla reports to at her office later paul owes large defeat to mr marchand the club owner hoosier state and then there is pauls parole officer there seems to be so much question about this justness discharged last characters side story reviewers point it out as a weakness in an subterraneous otherwise well crafted subterranean game of pingpong between our two protagonists escalating titfortat until their lives brain change dramatically they are beholden to each agent of the man one or both could be fired killed subconscious mind or imprisoned if they dont do as they are imprison toldthe film has a sense of relief at the end carla finally gets laid her boss is forced out for being a jerk then mr club owner is a comprise pulpy mess in make his own bathroom seem they get the money and they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer because his moral by weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement or whatever the police found rightness to arrest him it is a critical subconscious trigger to the sensation lock tumbler that wound us up so tight never mind that someone else may get pauls file later to supervise his release for the comprise moment social club saul they are rightness individual free they might even then get apostle paul away with it woohoothey information technology stuck it to the man
0,i spotted the dvd on a store my home and since a cheesy horror flicks addict i wondered how good it was it even had two award mentions on the cover i dont remember what festival it so i figured hey this might be good so i bought for five euros and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews here either people bashed the movie to it was bad or people said the movie a wonderful feat in indie movies bla bla i then played dvd not thinking about any i had read with an open mind and not expecting anything at allman i like this critical but the movie was bad ok im just going to give out some pointers of what i thought actingdialog the was so confusing the actors did decent job but there were scenes were i could spot no effort at all from them the dialog even worst i think it was probably the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie the talking in between characters seemed off not just bad but away from actual happenings the movie the of the female character although well boring and annoying in a while but course the most ridiculous aspect was the aliens or the infected i wont even comment on that one just say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture visuals the strongest movie if you forget the awful and light flashes they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they supposed to be the camera in car was quite actually they didnt even used the environment inspire fear or dread they left that sound and video fx and the three infected characters the movie boring in so many scenes sound about this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was from computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the alien ahso what did i like in the movie the only thing i really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot somethingsomeone walking in a distant at really thought it me things but when the character realizes that figures coming towards her were her own reflection i was surprised pretty creepy idea done well apart from i had an awful timeand dont recommend this to anyone not teen get together because you cant even laugh at thisi give it a solid only some technical achievements worked here from that yeah

1,some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than mosti thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isnt iti would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last houseother than that worth a look
0,the vampire deed bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting notice horror films of picture show constituent the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky frankensteins monster for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village practice sometime in the comprise th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there amp is a very similar feel comprise to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is closing off arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of information technology early horror films in which lional atwill and practice fay wray costarred also doctor x approximation and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak merely and derivativeall we sting are past left with is a poorquality frankenstein a imitation with the vampire elements purely calm faux a device to hoodwink amusing dracula fans but subject for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and betimes comprise it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the amp blondie films a few years later

1,sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying lovestory and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this dn ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does halfgood movie and wont do a film for less than million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible i give this film a mere
1,without going into responsible details of a goodif a somewhat provocativetv and there buy to wanted responsible consensus among horny was that there is no one to blame herei disagree yes the young male i the beverly dangelo played by rob estes may be young it of climb good looking because hes not getting as much as he said from mom that doesnt mean he can and in bed movie have sex with what ok he can use the excuse he just be to watch tv with teen but lover seems dont and people have to take responsibility for their actions a only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable her when he was supposedly the not adulthe wants your mom must never know about this how any was he then yes its a good flick but he got daughter users coming to him dont kid yourselves folks that what happened was no ones fault
1,i comprise once again happen to like leslie howard in leslie howard his better films yet for some reason his performance in astir of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in and whatsoever the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the s and s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by fair dirk bogard as field of study the man who was born to leslie howard be betrayed fell this is not usually the case wish off hand i think of hoosier state ashley wilkes picture show as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant panoptic to be an item by entirely margaret mitchell but ashley loved accept melonie not scarlett howard could play bring any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him a hoosier state liberal westerner canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal world health organization and howard does not usher shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except argue by history perhaps as he hoosier state feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by go on humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams accept of hoosier state human hoosier state bondage is soulful leslie howard too he is usher defecate sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in astir art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and mightiness sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set valet de chambre up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette usher davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip world health organization falls for her is not really addressed in the film but weakling he does find the woman fascinating and she billy mitchell finds him an easy meal ticket hoosier state ironically in being newsprint so captivated by james augustine aloysius joyce this slut philip doe fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his eminence mate he also keeps finding hoosier state himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald leslie howard denny the comprise latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat picture show tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for bang his performance here quality it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in helium gone with the wind that problem he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered spirited in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two along thirds of the film culminating in that hoosier state famous bluffly hoosier state scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of digest her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her comprise health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks amp what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is hoosier state glad inclination which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but found along mildred ends a casualty ironically her death isolated discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical picture show call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did retrieve fail to nominate davis determine in leading to the largest write in campaign in fell its history and a permanent neglect change in about its rules but davis was assay established as amp a aim star in one year she won the oscar as maine joyce expiry heth in dangerous and in two years compeer she costarred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest
0,a collection of deleted and alternative takes together and with added voiceover to make it appear to take place the events of the first pretty cool idea but deleted scenes left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof as its just not as funny as anchorman and lets face that film wasnt exactly comedy gold either so you get a movie worse than one that was moderately funny in my eyes that still puts it one or two notches above kicking and screaming or bewitched chross your fingers that the wedding crashers is a return to old school form no pun intended my grade d
0,it picture show entirely was one of those late night its there i saw valet de chambre it things sometimes they are great this one was awful but marvellous eve it really shouldnt have beenthe movie had a really good cast how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance were neglect talking oscar winner turf here it had good special effects it even had some really good tits and i mean nicely shown full usher breast with full nipple and accept at one point even some beaver but rest period it didnt picture show compensate for the one missing ingredient a story the plot was ludicrous i dont mean the solar crisis sun exploding stuff but that was bad burst forth enough it was the rest of the stuff the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff man that just stank no amount of good acting or cool space ships blank space merely or fight scenes could get around that gormandise onei have seen the same cast members be incredibly good valet de chambre i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets all the difference is in the writing

0,mel welles you might remember him as mr mushnick in roger cormans little shop of horrors directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of dr frankensteins daughter carrying on her fathers work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to bedo good but rather for its sex appeal you see tania frankenstein though a doctor and scientist in her own right is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love the story is tissuethin here and one gets what one might expect lots of leering and suggestive commentssurprisingly most from the female lead special effects that are not so special acting that lacks depth of characterization and not really much action or suspense and while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling lady frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless italian actress rosalba neri aka sara baybey plays the barons daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal she oozes desire and seduction quite well her performance is pretty onedimensional but she is quite lovely and plays overthetop a little too well she is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift poor joseph cotten now regulated to european horror films for money plays the father in a brief yet competent performance he is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear as for the rest of the cast paul muller is somewhat effective as dr charles marshall the barons assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village policemani wasnt buying thismickey hargitay starts to pump tania for answers despite what you might think not to her satisfaction where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script weak performances and lackluster direction all head further south the creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the s while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones
0,jared diamond made a point in the first that other of the world didnt have animals domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were to make steel and invent complex then the third he says when the europeans in south africa got too far north they into zulu people other tribes that herded cattle and planted crops so what explains their of technological economic artistic achievement if they had the key things author claims are needed for successdiamond also claims germs in the of smallpox brought to north america by black slaves were our weapon well if europeans can defeat native warriors and nonmilitary south africans can defeat zulus without a single casualty in either case then i think you to conclude that germs are irrelevant with or without germs we going to succeedhe says stopped europeans from colonizing further killing thousands of europeans while not affecting africans id like to know numbers but he doesnt say then at the end he says today is killing thousands of africans and that is why they cant catch up with us which is it jared did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them and how come europe did okay despite plagues throughout our history he also far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at times when the threatens to overwhelm his rickety hes reluctant to that maybe europeans were successful because worked for its sad watch this obvious neomarxist contort reality to try to prove his point

1,it appears that theres no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams its often foolish and illogical its also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our angeljeanettes deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight at one point she gets to sing a snippet from carmen followed by the final trio of faust holding a lapdog for some strange reason then aloha oe on the beach its a surreal comedytremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove
0,being in edinburgh and have owner great thirst for history i was very put off by the libertys taken wrong breed of dog for a start bobbys a old and was the old single man who came to edinburgh jock and hoping pauper in lodgings not like in the film at all flimsy anyone coming to edinburgh film the to will sights of the filmyou will not find said graveyard in princes st gardens i time a few moments were a tissues would have been great the actors were fantastic at padding out a rather for script there dont feel the poor wee bobby actually got enough screen were possibly due to living lost at one point all that a an died was fine and any yr old see enjoy
1,alice enters in a world of wonder but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid the mad hatter the white rabbit the queen and others even tweedledee and tweedledum show alice some things about her body and other peoples bodies that might be quite wonderful a tale of love and lust the likes youve never seenkristine debell appears as alice i must say by s standards this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day i believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work but it was pretty much the best possible one she could have chosen my love for all things alice is no secret even better than fairy tales which isnt really pornography so muchthe songs are cheesy but fit the theme of the movie one song whats a girl like you doing on a knight like this was pretty funny and the others had similar themes going the trial towards the end was well scripted and fit very nicely into the world of alice the logic and humor were definitely accounted forwhat more can you say about a film like this all i know is for people who are used to adult films where its just a second leadin to the sex this one is going to overload you with plot and music but personally i think theres something very special about this film and i hope it gets a nice dvd release with things touched up and special features if thats even possible i can see this being a cult film

0,once upon a time there was a director by the name of james he brought us wonderfully thrilling sciencefiction such as terminator and aliens these movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the first light of computer yield special effects put down upon the mental picture industry terminator showed ease up us glimpses of what was possible in this new eraand then it happened countless awardsobscene amount of moneyoutlandish barrage of advertisingmaximum lucre margintitanic was herei have never ever been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it in fact i have often drive the inverse stance from the majority just to get an argument going titanic however was a mental picture i only conduct one single positive out of that of kate winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughoutquickly the dialogue was like something out of beverly hills the act was more wooden than my nephews shoetree put up visualise imply to terrify were actually comical man falling from embark and hitting propeller historically false dont eve get me take up because theres too much it had horrific theme music up there with the bodyguard for cheese and the pointless love taradiddle was so tedious self take up and pathetic that it disrespect the plight of everyone else involved i was glad when he died and disappointed when she did notit was plainly obvious from the word go that this mental picture was contrive to appeal to mtv watching bubblegum chewing boywithcar chasing teenage girls decaprio himself resembled something less grand than the weedy member of a boy band who would drag on their sexstarved boyfriends out for a three and a half minutes chickflick hoping to get lucky recent the worst look was that it did not stop at that place millions of dumbed down culture vulture perish to examine this expensive waste of synthetic because it monetary value so much to give rise it moldiness be nifty and steve and barbara said it was dependable and they know their movies the crowning halo go far when titanic swept the boards at the academy awards king james of hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half minutes farce was ground it looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that leash to the death of a lot of people however if people are stupid and sentimental decent to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off dependable luck to hollywood if that is how they wishing to make money id do it if i had those kind of gamble in lifeit is right up there on my all time worst movies heel with other silly historically falsehuman interest tripe like the patriot and pearl shield
0,the fbi story was charles dudley warner bros minute heroic testimonial to the far famed criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a middling laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studio apartment musical magician grievous bodily harm steinerthe movie charts the history of the chest from its low beginnings in the twenties to modern metre and its all see through the recollections of mature fastidious agent chip hardesty james jimmy stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it advance it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie output as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from assume on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma doggy dillinger etc to categorization out nefarious organisations like the ku klux kkk nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be order that only for the screen presence and ingathering of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster what is more this is some other problem with the picture jimmy stewart is left to carry the integral movie almost on his own with the elision of vera stat mi who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted married woman he is palisade by a cast of nonaged players throughout you observe yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a gangster or a police chief or any but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever so occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good look inside the works of the chest with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the one thousand of men and women who work for the organisation which include the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peep inside headquarters which business firm the gigantic records incision and we also get a glimpse of the pharmacist and fingerprint experts meticulously blend in through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is grievous bodily harm steiners remarkable score heard over the deed is a powerful wake up and set march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux kkk sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal official scout troop on ahorseback the fbi story was one of five oodles the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval heroic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summertime place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit melody for steiner better known as theme from a summertime placethe fbi story just about fling muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie jimmy stewart who hold anything watchableclassic but farfetched line from the fbi story as the insipid nick disco biscuit who has just be adrift up a plane with hoi polloi on circuit card include his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canon city prison for the next calendar month or so after that you can send it to hell wow
0,the film moves along quite well but the acting direction and editing leave a lot to be desired the characters are mostly lifted from other films and the vinnie jones lookalike is straight out of gone in seconds the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrast the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shoot out that leaves everyone dead you should never really know whether to laugh or just sit there in shock this movie had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut at the small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once belief has been unsuspended one just become increasingly critical a pity cos it was a brave attempt and although clint eastwood is famous for saying thatll be ok for a scene he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood here a bit more imagination with the camera and and a bit more coaching and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference
0,i am glad the read so many negative comments about the and plot everyone i talk to says the same the they like houses gruff nature tritter his intelligence but really the the is of this continuing plot it cuts into the they nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry very police cannot it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the thing also there seems to be many it legal aspects to what tritter vindictiveness actually doing he alone authority freeze accounts and have the authority to stop is you not prescriptions for patients a lot of the vindictiveness he trittor showing also is hurting to at sick patients at the hospital and hospital is writing a good storyline to portray i hate the episode awful not because of the story itself insert when hurt but dislike doctors piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets from by questionable people say real voted to watch the story lines anymore please change it get tritter out

0,title dracula ad director alan gibson cast peter cushing christopher stephanie beacham review sometimes movies can be time capsules that transport you back to any time in this caseour time capsule is hammers dracula ad which transports us back to a in which austin powers would felt right at story is about these of kids were not gang were a group that love to hang out at a caf shop called the one day johnny alucard hmm strange last namewaitit spells dracula a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks he offers them a night of mass and black magic to which they also say sure why the hell not it could be fun so in no time flat the find themselves resurrecting count dracula from the ashesthis movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuses home he knows of the people at his party yet there they all are partying the night in house doing drugs making out and dancing on top of tables the filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young considered cool at that time everyone says words like way out and groovy and they finish of their sentences saying all that jazz so yeah its pretty evident that this is the to top it all off theres a band sounds something jefferson mean youll be all things s and as i watched this kept asking myself how the heck is dracula his black cape and get up going to fit into all this and thats exactly what happens old out of place amidst all partying and the rock and roll and drugs of the in the are greatbut sadly the music they to add to the proceedings doesnt fit all and completely takes you out of the mood of something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and congos start to beat and your completely taken out of the horror element sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for mebut all in all putting the distracting s music aside an illness that satanic rites of dracula also suffered the movie was pretty good but i mention this the story was just a rehash of what we had seen before taste the blood of in story is damn near identical seea lad draculas ring and ashescheck he then bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting intocheck black mass bring dracula back in a desecrated churchcheck the list of similarities goes on and on so this aint very original if you ask methere are a few things make this movie worth while for example the fact that the movie is time to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining i kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in i couldnt believe some of the clothes these people wore and the they drove it movie fun for me but we are here to get were here to see drac kill a few virgins and take his revenge on the house did we get any of that yeah theres a few sequences in there to satisfy old school hammer fans first off theres the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic they mention the name of many a demon and blood is that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music its most moment then theres draculas actual which ill admit was great from standpoint some mist comes out of draculas grave and slowly but surely christopher lees silhouette and face emerge from the fog cool shot i loved we have a and lee face off at the end and i couldnt help to laugh at one point when dracula hurls a piece of furniture through the air i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of its this hammer tradition where the characters start candle sticks and at other and i think to myself arent their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing candle stick at our hero oh well anyhows draculas demise in this one is very similar all the other hammer draculas before it vampire gets slaked and then we cut to a series of frames until theres only ashes leftall in all an unintentionally hammer dracula film its trapped the s and though makes it a fun watch and not as horrible satanic rites of dracula it still doesnt gel well with the dracula universe we had come to expect from hammerrating out of

1,oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time the best word to describe it is genius the amp writing the acting the story lines everything about this show information technology amp is absolutely amazing i just discovered the show and i became addicted to it right away wish think and i was really surprised that it hasnt gotten the recognition it truly deserves it is violent and most amp of the characters arent meant for you to like them approximately but the show is written in such a brilliant way naturalistic that allows you to look quality past information technology the violence and the criminals and see them information technology as real people they are the lowest forms of scum but it still finds a way to allow you ramp to understand a lot addict of the characters and even care about approximately their storiesthe violence in storm comprise the show is necessary for it to be as realistic as possible but the show isnt about the violence like some people might believe it really is a work of art and im sure who requisite ever gives it a chance will love it just as much bang as i do

0,i saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon it was playing on the family programming channel of hbo at first i was drawn in by what i thought was a disney animation then after a few minutes i found myself searching for the remote i could find the info button find out what in the was my tv i have nothing against harvey f i enjoy him in many of his films but one thing he is not is a voiceover artist sure he has one the more unique voices in hollywood it works only as a part of bigger visual package attaching his voice to a cute made watching somewhat difficult as for the rest of the cast uninspired i suppose working on this film didnt appeal to the really good voice over talent out thereso voice talent strong animationwho this film targeting adolescent ducks i dont get it is a dearth of rolemodels for up and coming homosexuals that we must resort to animated ducks cute story and like the this movie i hard love just like an ugly duckling
1,weak scripts at times cheesy special effects at times yep deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time yep more about carl kolchak darren mcgavin yep always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but found so much of the draculafrankensteinmummyhorror as just so much crap it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the dark side of entertainment the duke had rooster cogburn eastwood had dirty harry garner had maverick and rockford had magnum and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak mixed with those weak scripts cheesy special effects that baroque of supporting characters and stars there was darren as carl kolchak he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual coverup by government officials additionally unlike of us kolchak was willing to stick his neck and do what needed to be done even if meant his demise the end of his journalistic career or jail time for all his faults including no taste in clothes carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang which was an old used car at time on his way to save the for humanity as good as any other fictional carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one thanks to darren mcgavin now that hes passed on and his show is on dvd i hope hes having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak night stalker all over again
1,i feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie i actually ran across this movie by accident i was taping another movie on showtime one night overnight and this movie came on afterward so i sat and watched it and boy was i blown away the acting is absolutely superb kathy bateswho has been my favorite actress since misery and fried green tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values religion family at the risk of alienating her family martin sheen is superb as the tough patriarch who is really not in control of anything in his life or family the one thing i really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes come home it shows the true damage that is done to our soldiers after they fight pointless wars for political and financial gain this movie just blew me away and i feel blessed to have accidentally taped this movie and seen it this is a mustsee for anyone who wants a true drama this is not too melodramatic and preachy but pulls at your heartstrings like none other
1,trapped buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened and is commercial message soon to closewe start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts to avoid amp the possibility of avalanches somehow that doesnt make sense anyways hes about astir peg to potential blow away one particularly hoosier state big one swallow when he notices the cat resort is amp open despite his best efforts higher authority tells him his day is oversoon as everyone expects an avalanche hitslook im not spread out gonna reveal any more all i can say is this was a bmovie designed for the family channel which i just saw it he on and the fact it had no commercials proves its a bmovie amp anyways its a pretty decent film but its partially unrealfirsthand when roll down people are buried by ice and snow theyre buried puke not just traced by swallow powder or what about a cd for a screwdriver its not possible and finally what i cant stress enough is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche it guaranteedfurthermore its worth a it rental or a tv viewing but not owning the movie is rated hoosier state pg but maybe it should have received something a little more strong a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator but his leg is cut around the ankle a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel and in amp fetch the weight commercial message room dead people are laying aroundenjoy
0,a hint i think may be gathered by the various annotate on this threadi was rather amazed at the count of people who like this film who want to make it mandatory or compulsoryi think this gives us a little spot of sixth sense into the conclude this film and the count underlying it is so polarizingthe global heating count ingathering a lot to people who want to force others to do right it ingathering particularly to more liberal slant people because it doesnt have to do with bedroom ethical motive which is what usually gets conservative who want to force you to be good goingand thats the problem with the film al gore is a politician and a very successful one at that he just buzzword help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would the political invoke is just too greatand there we are left with a scientific count that may be of huge grandness trim to a political count appealing to those in the body politic with a taste to force other to do rightanother interesting question is how did the environmental trend get hijacked by such people
1,now possibly it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low gear orient in my life when i was really trying to flesh out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy but this shoot really spoke to me jane is an everywoman although she has so many positive thing going for her she is quiet vulnerable and distressed in her life she is strong and intelligent but she was cheat on out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a secondchoice life she seeks out new challenges and happiness seeking urgently to fulfill the jam in her heart dreya weber is an recherche jane as we travel with her we tactile property the depth of her despair the torture of her desperation and finally the strength of her conviction the beautiful addie yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production allison mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing i extremely advocate this shoot although its low gear budget it has big budget compose and production values ps great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women women will love the story and type but there something for the men here too
0,irwin allen was great all of his had a great pilot or first episode the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows a few episodes swiss family robinson were rip offs his older tv shows one episode of swiss identical to an episode of land of the giants a member of the an the show was high budget and too expensive to irwin lost his touch with tv shows after the the acting strong with martin milner child stars got there starts this show like willie ames helen hunt one bright spot is when irwin allen incorporates his disaster like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing the disaster
1,a few years ago while i was charter some movies i came across subspecies complete up watching it and in reality kind of liking it we need a good lamia gore click that doesnt hold rearwards but when i went rearwards to the telecasting store they aforesaid they didnt have any other subspecies videos unfortunately the same went for any other telecasting store i checked out i pay up until someone on youtube in reality posted all the subspecies photographic film and i got to watch them all last night and im hooked i am now a fan of the full moon subspecies serial i think because this was the type of horror film i have been looking for ive been looking for a good cheesy scare off for a farseeing time and subspecies filled that spot radu is one of the coolest vampire on screen and almost gives nosferatu a lam for his fangs radu is an evil lamia who is after his blood stone his birth religious rite the stone contains some blood that is utterly unbelievable and gives him strength three american english little girl who are perusing romanian account and culture hump into a man stephan who offers to avail they stay at radus castle where we find out that stephan is radus brother radu seduce and turns two of the little girl but stephan falls for one of the little girl michelle and will do anything to protect hersubspecies is a fun serial despite the cheesy effects it makes it in some ways more likable plus radu was a perfect villain as stephan was the perfect angel wish romantic lamia the narrative is scarey and i think this was a fun lamia movie this was also the first in the serial the secure part is the continuation are just as fun i would recommend this for a scary movie night watch it in the dark radu is sure to send off shivers down your spine or even your neck ok cheesy joke couldnt protest
1,now this evidence depend like most of the other shows of its type from the mid s but the only thing is about this one is that its unlike they use a deal of drollery and action in this one and maybe a trivial bit of drama too i in person thought it was a good evidence i cant understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this evidence is distillery alive ever since up to datemy hopes is that the weber bring cover the evidence or tied do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesnt hurt to dream doesnt itanyway i would recommend if you hadnt realize it to feel the dvd of all sequence because the characters are great the story lines are good the drollery is good and advantageously the whole evidence is just great
0,it come out out with an interesting premise i constantly alike polite war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b complex vitamin movie at best in the latter half it quickly suit a c movie then d then f then i wish that this wasnt a rental so that i could put it in the microwave i cant say that the acting in all typeface was awful just most the writing however i never read the book perhaps the book is well written the screenplay was written by a class old it was ridiculously shallow the dialogue drab and uninteresting the case about as interesting as a pound bag of fertilizer i really detested this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with pic that promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful horrific worthless if you liked it i powerfully commend superman
0,young couple on the road minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight yet suddenly theyre being menaced terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pickup truck hmm where have i seen premise before oh yeah now i remember weve this a times before already and approximately nine and ninetynine of the other cases were much better than rest stop this weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans as it doesnt feature a single original twist memorable gimmick its very sadistic but every teenkillslasher flick is sadistic nasty nowadays so thats no real surprise anymore neither the absolute main with this production is the incredibly amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots writerdirector john damn well that the ultrathin basic storyline nearly wasnt enough to fill a whole movie with and thus stuffs up his film like a thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material nicoles boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in killing off her character right away wouldnt result in a very long movie thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks suffers from visions in which she talks to the deranged killers victims and she has deeply emotional boring conversations with a police who just wont die even though a truck ran himtwice the dumb plots never lead anywhere and theyre definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to movies length ive ever seen instead of all the pointless padding shiban should have attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable jaimie character nicole is an annoying and brainless girl you wont really care shell survive the ordeal or not her boyfriend jesse as as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still werent painful enough if you ask me i exactly three sequences all including torture and gratuitous mutilation that were gory and exciting enough bring a sadist smile on face thats still way too few for a horror movie basically rest stop is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like wolf creek and hostel but youre better watching the originals this was the first film of the new production company called theyre promoting as the new name in great but theyll have come with something much better than rest if they want us to believe that
1,what is really sad shows like six degrees and brothers sisters the true reality tv that that are nothing glorified game shows i think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past years with very premature cancellations of numerous shows with a cult but with the vocal fans of jericho which i also enjoy and other shows networks may start to reverse this trend i am like others i will not support any new shows until they have been given a season ill then a to watch and catch up via dvds and online viewing until then abc you have lost me as a viewer to any new show
1,ok so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid however i think there can never be too many movies like the first karate kid theres something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself in this movie hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of hernot to say this movie is not without its problems unlike the first one mr miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life and doesnt really explain why they do what they do in the plotline the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly hateable bad guys i also have a suspicion about martial arts movies that end on prom nightso maybe this isnt a perfect movie so maybe this wouldnt be the greatest movie to rent on a friday night however in more ways than one its a guilty pleasure hillary swank is just so loveable and the story even though unoriginal works in a genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence this is a breath of fresh air unlike all those steven seagal and jean claude vandamme this is a movie about the spirit and the heart there are some people that need movies like this and well take whatever we can get my rating
1,we might just be on to something here first they had remember the titans with a a story based on truth involving sports to denzel small town and middle america now with quaid and when rookie yet another sports story based a truthboth movies move you to tears expected smile and both make you times and feel all warm after seeing them my wife and i took in the rookie in disney at it and be a great feel good type movie we were not let down when asked if wed it buying this on dvd the it comes out be was on nobrainer most definately
1,door have always show a great admirer her nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs exuding play and while most of the gary takes place in a stage room it goes has some and roegs cinematic delighted very unique story is about a highlights actress theresa russell who after a hard nights and going a film on still to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel admirable they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed is him but as they start to get undressed professor husband is banging where the i at for is a times exbaseball player of busey of he wants to busey what with on in the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is probably room and what he future holds challenging the meanwhile a famous senator tony russell is been to take away the this papers if the doesnt that at a hearing persona curtis is just excellent and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of hotel the phobias and nuances on monroe is very well known husband one thing them film does is threatening her as not only a woman on the one of gives mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have of and film one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent think that professors is russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters the to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of collaboration reasons for the as know also a a good solid performance work it reminds me of what a strong theresa he gives off on screen emil actions the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last scene in this is film a demonstration of his darker side verge cherokee the famous children the film for me all continue little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what of indians case about at is famous but of course the famous scene in this film is on russell demonstrates to of and she does understand their theory of relativity how uses toys to show this the her is flare by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in real life and they do testify work when they are in many and this is going their best film together good performances and a very interesting job emil directing make this a for and visually thought provoking film
0,i dvd because it kari in it and the mpaa ratings said rated r for strong and and languagewhich imo should state r for strong violence sexuality nudity and languagethe word sexuality should come after a comma not an and because the huge in meaning it make i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the and nudity parts almost nonexistent my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like movie that is i felt storywise it was soso afterall who really cares about the story if the was in it i know dontof this is my opinionjoseph
0,the movie appeals to public due to charisma of ben stiller and notoriety of j aniston it seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title but theres nothing successful in this moviepolly is very well played by aniston no doubt this is the kind of character which suits her perfectly bem stiller is the same troublesome guy like in meet the parents but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned abovethe script is very poor with nothing special at all with this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script out of

0,being a huge lover of the behind series i was rattling looking onward to the release of this filmi was thirstily foresee a laugh a minute rollercoaster ridealaswhere to first on this messi think its a good first to say that its scarce richie and eddie on our screens in the first property as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funnyi was still waiting for the first laugh after a good minutes of viewingmany aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the motion picture was full of those bad moment they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cutthe boilers suit sets and atmosphere surrounding the motion picture is obscure and dingy which i theorize is good if they want to limn the terrible guest house the goofball attempt to runbut to me its just puts an tied higher dampener on a sorry tell of filming that should never have been createdthe actingat timesis patheticfenella fielding is rot as the whacky mrs foxfur and ive seen paul simon pegg have much better outingsid recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they power appreciate the terrible puns much morebut to any behind lover who hasnt seen this motion picture and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned
1,sure titanic was good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying lovestory and think ooh how romantic the second and i am not the only one to this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking is this dn going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several the in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for film i mean who does think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does halfgood and wont do a film for less than million and then everyone is suprised there are hardly any films with him in it but enough in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslets performance the hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very to put a film of such a there is lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible i give a mere
0,i happened to amp catch this on tv and wanted to watch because i amp remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based i was very disappointed first if james belushi is the lead actor in a hoosier state discourse movie it should be a book sign that its not exactly an alist production gregory hines was a world class a dancer but amp sadly not a great actorin fact all of the acting in this confederacy film is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the director who is this films weakest link charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stones jfk in comprise portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the real child murderers but gravid need without the benefit of a good script an alist cast or it must be said the talent it just picture show doesnt workits a shame that such a expert try worthy topic for a film did not get better decrepit treatment

1,i love the premise but its replay value is only for certain partsthe opening scene of course some characters are a bit outrageous but they are entertaining none the less i think the ballping sht was pushing it i know it was to show that nick and casey were living foul out in la and to show why casey quit the lifestyle i just think that the flashbacks story could have been better also the jamaican guy rapping on the phone is clever and entertaining but once again i think the story was told sloppy it really seems unbelievable i actually believe swordfish the other movie woods has written more than some of the parts in thursday because the government keeps sht a secret all the time and has organizations set up that the public will never know aboutthursday is the best quentinesque movie ive seen i think woods is imaginativeclever and has witt however his work needs more maturation to even to get to the natural born killer script not stones movie level how old is he anyway

0,this documentary or i should approximation feed say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the faux people be when dragon they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate waste product atomic number defecate someone cryptozoology it is unscience uncollectible it just non destroy it however something positive admittedly in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some s of the information in this candidly mockumentary was totally wherefore fake and that is really disappointing because orgasm it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the make hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon imitation stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in imitation the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does faux not appear from nothing so entropy it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons harmonize survive depending of that it is ridiculous ebullience they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are atomic number not people like them entropy outlive say lies scientist like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do then not think that a person who cares personal effects about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time
1,in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time the theme of workers v management amp with lots of talk of unions and rights perhaps dates stem the film try a bit now as its no longer a subject discussed mightily all that much but date that doesnt it stop white suit from being a show stopping classicthe plot about splendor a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil doesnt sound exciting when written down but the wearisome film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks radical it out as a determine true ealing comedy the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout he the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic compassion images and sequences such as guinness being able to amp use amp his comprise indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is full of dry wit sensation is he all right yes pity and characterisation is first rate im always astonished by the wonderful unmindful direction closure in these films amp as well comedies female person of later eras would adopt a expert point the camera at the actors and let it roll mentality but the ealing films always cut attempted interesting lighting framework and angles and innovations this film is carrying out no exceptionof course its the cast that comprise lifts the material to dizzying heights alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance with eyes that convey wonder joy and comprise crushing defeat whenever the story demands it stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work such an insular character could quickly amp have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable so much so that the closing stages of the film generate diagram a real valet de chambre sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top unmindful actor in a world that wants to bury everything hes ever worked for associate in nursing joan greenwood plays another of her splendor strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual as are befuddled cecil parker and wish slimy michael gough everybody gets laughs industriousness without even trying to mankind its comical british understatement at its finestthe man in the white suit is minutes of sheer brilliance with a great plot institution channel great cast sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism absolutely top notch
0,spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequelmakers think that they have to explain and therefore destroy the mysteries behind iconic horror films the original hellraiser of was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made the sequel hellbound was also a fantastic horror film though i personally didnt like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites some of the alltime creepiest horrorvillains in the original the third part hell on earth was already quite a mess whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy leadcenobite pinhead a typical s stupidity and therefore destroyed most of his scariness this fourth part hellraiser bloodline is slightly more atmospheric than the third one but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary background information about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hellseriously did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made i think not and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film the setting of bloodline goes back and forth in three different periods the film begins in a nd century spacestation when scientist dr merchant bruce ramsay attempts to close the gates to hell forever when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons in th century paris merchants ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an evoked demon the princess of hell took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina vargas since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages the film which takes place in the th century the present and the nd century really is quite a mess i admit that the part set in the th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements the films undoubtedly strong points are the terrific makeup and goreeffects the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the shedemon and pinhead doug bradley who in spite of having lost some of his creepiness still is a menacing villain it is an almost offensive idea for hellraiser fans however that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous lightshow overall bloodline is not a complete disaster but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee overall this is only recommendable to hardcore pinheadfanatics and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demons creepiness all others are welladvised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second part of the hellraiser franchise and skip all the others the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy as hell but almost everything else is disappointing my rating

1,i thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey tarzan concept made so popular by hollywood weismuller et alyes there is a lot of silly stuff but then the idea is silly it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees i am tempted to say completely unbelievable but that the concept has never been tried and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthoodstill if you can get your head around that lot theres a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play there are plenty of other excellent performances too not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holmwhat is particularly disturbing and rightly so is the simian perception of humans we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor dumb helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it and it demonstrates well how the phony civilisation and morality with which we cloak and justify our conduct is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance it may seem a little overstated at times especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms but what we see isnt just a truth about the victorians its a truth about the way we are today its one that needs to be stated and cannot be stated often enough holms characters obsession with the rayzor as a symptom of civilisation as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned is an excellent case in point primitive bearded readers take notethe story is depressing ultimately its a tragedy because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human civilisation we know hes doomed before the third millennium is years old wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excessin the end its a tale about ourselves the path to extinction that other simians tread must eventually be followed by humanshighly recommended for its ethical take despite the hokey moments

0,this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great sure chaos and inside man are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense but i found chaos more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film swordfish the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find a distributor in the uk and usa its true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films but that doesnt mean that it is a pleasant film to watch watch it if nothing else is on tv but youll probably get bored with after awhile

0,im probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy frisk the project that put todd verow on the map if that is indeed where he is i appreciated that someone had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material verow fairly rolls around in it judging from what hes done since then hes wellsuited for that type of material and should probably stick to it vacationland a wouldbe teen coming out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy and im disappointed i have to report thatfirst off our hero the high school senior joe is far too old in appearance to be playing when we later meet a man who is supposed to be joes teacher its confusing as the sweatyfaced guy looks much younger than the student hes teaching joes mother looks younger than he does and doesnt act any older either second in joes opening scenes he looked like he was either playing or actually experiencing mental challenges to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was playing young but it just wasnt workingit was weirdits minutes in before anything is revealed about who what and where these people are and why we should care the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a mens toilet room that considering where the story goes later is absolutely superfluous the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a rite of passage for our young heroone minute joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex a scene so unerotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice the next minute hes an expert at sexual blackmail and violent doublecrossing this is followed by an extended scene with the character well later learn is andrew and thats about all we learn about him other than hes apparently gay but not out yettheres a lot crammed in to the running time which is about minutes too longi cant imagine how it played with the mindnumbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around a subplot copped from gods and monsters with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously cant remember his lines he is conveniently dispatched with in a way dickens might have come up with on a slow week a mixnmatch almostfourway between the boys and their girlfriends a gaybashing toilet tramp a wouldbe wise sage in the form of a nellie queen and hasnt the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker with the heart of gold as most tired stereotype who exists only to be degraded blackmail theft murder alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recordingwhat you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots were expected to imagine were in an airport grocery store office and classroom as all the scenes in these locations consist of closeups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar either its the worst bar in the world or there are only about gay men in bangor maine as the bar never has any patrons in it another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasnt coming from the speakers but was just more of the droning loopmusic of the scoreplots and characters come and go emotions are unreadable and the dialog clearly inspired by dennis cooper is filmspeak meaning no humans actually talk this way since we arent given any information about these characters its impossible to care about what happens to them its as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll certainly the character of joes sister a wannabee jennifer grey who is bohemiacrazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is in la or what her problem isbut againdoes it matter visually the film looks very good at times more a testament to new developments in hidef video than anything i suspect the editing is pretty clunky though there was one great edit joe is posing naked and says i wanted to play sports but and we cut to a shot revealing his butt ha ha composition is also odd at times i thought i was watching sctvs parody of persona when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole sceneone senses verow is really restraining himself from making a naughtier or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does and maybe he shouldnt have held back the frothy toothpastesex fantasy worked nicely i thought though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the moviehe produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like herschell gordon lewis directed films without goreporn films without sex in them i got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasnt boring it just wasnt very good either

0,the best thing about the movie is the name as it both describes the plot and the acting at least they cannot say they didnt warn you kind of like the button labeled dont push thissegal must have run out of things that move like planes trains and ships but the plot remains the same under cover guy who fights slowly but still beats like mercenary types and doesnt even blink when doing so what amazes me is that segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and clips of ammo where do all these bullets actually go to the only redeeming feature of this movie is watching nia peeples pound ja rule real name jeffrey atkins doesnt quite sound so punk into the floor i could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that especially wearing an outfit like that it was just a bonus watching jeffy get is ss kicked and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed sorry its just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy cant act rappers out of the movies pleeeeease who came up with idea anyway id lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angelsthe only surprising twist in this movie is that they dont do the politically correct thing and have jeffy come in and save the day no doubt if snoop otherwise known by his momma as calvin broadus which again doesnt sound so cool when you refer to him as cal had been in the movie hed throw some signs down on her and probably saved segals life or something

0,looter pitiful the first word that sprung to creative thinker whilst see the film is gremlins its the only critter movie i have take in from the four picture but i savour it it wasnt too complicated as i hadnt take in the by deuce but i thought it was quite a practiced movie all the same critter take up with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the means to a holiday although it turns out that they end up at their own internal which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl encounter up with a boy dally by leo dicaprio and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tell them to be careful and lug because of the critter he look a spot psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the critter steal a ride of the girl and boys car and end up in their flat affair they hide out in the basement and end up belt down this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girls dad they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the critter eat lug in the kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene and i vernacular retrieve not a practiced affair but im sure as shooting they have to go back for somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last deuce critter he is told he vernacular because they are queer and so he sends them homethe ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy snuff it as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have drink down off its a throb exciting movie deserving a watch but if youre looking for a better version of this literary genre i recommend the gremlins picture pitiful
1,im giving this pic out of only because there arent enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce intellectual nourishment to fulfil the science haters mdixon appear to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this shove up but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that at the very least they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to depend on oil we must transition to dissimilar typecast of energy and do not have a plan that will supervene upon the amount of energy we get from oil other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have perished read jared diamonds collapse which is a pop ledger or any elementary environmental science or dry land science textbook and you can aver the basic premise of this movie go ahead fiddle while rome burn off

0,past what information technology a great word reimagining argue is isnt quality that what they call dawn of the information technology dead mmiv a belike clever word indeed it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate remake that is entirely and makes it almost sound past as if the give thanks process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well damn was i misled at least i was seduced neer more tending by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of reimagining though it played a rolestill why make a remake directors do it for only give thanks a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern audience or because they personally love picture the original and want to make a tribute to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions boils down to one thing stealing someones idea and reshaping it grownup or hoi polloi reimagining it so that those who would never then see it or understand it would pay contain money to see it its hoosier state like colescliffs notes dump everything simply in a blender comprise purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors in other words comprise a great marketing schemeso whats wrong with this one well ill start with master what i liked i liked the opening scenes accept contain thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of subject the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero make tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means we see the city in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and death two words that look nobelium beautiful on screen then it all falls apartthis setup leads nowhere the movie does what almost every remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story its noisier in some sense bloodier and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical contain subplots the setting the mall which played a crucial role in the original films story and theme is purely coincidental the idea communicated in romeros film the pure simply numb ecstatic joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is gone here further master this reimagining has no moxie no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no merely attention span and doesnt bother to get us interested in the characters imaginativeness or the story the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions non of the four characters of the original hoi polloi you actually grew to care about those people in romeros version because there was a certain nobelium realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here contain you dont care when or who goes what matters picture is how they hera gowhat else is their to say the film bang is likely not scary it has one or two jump scenes and it tries to make up for the hearing rest with gore and loud special effects as a story its bureau really interpret too choppy to be followed and picture the conflicts between the comprise characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is also reduced quality to amp a few oneliners and wherefore one really good character andy after information technology that what remains an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable festinate ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though select not quite as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for one thing it kicked information technology the passion of christ from its number one spot in the box office well done zombies
0,living in edinburgh and have a great thirst for history i was very put off by the libertys taken wrong breed of dog for a start bobbys owner old jock was an old single man who came to edinburgh and died a pauper in lodgings not like in the film at all for anyone coming to edinburgh and hoping to see sights of the filmyou will not find the graveyard in princes st gardens there were a few moments were a tissues would have been great the actors were fantastic at padding out a rather flimsy script i dont feel the poor wee bobby actually got enough screen time possibly due to being lost at one point all that said the film was fine and any yr old will enjoy
0,i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early s motion picture show that die hard fans of most slasher motion picture show just had to see well i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense crack for most slasher pic such as apr fool day friday th and promenade night this plastic film could have been properly up there with the above mentioned only it miss true enthusiasm and voltage from the characters as well as the on snuff it story characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping or so the dormitory and of course of action leading up to his true climatical role during the last with he faces the killer another would be the dirty seedy looking guy with the denim jacket he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting rather the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the last which was a scourge i was frustrated in his part in the last as far as the true personal identity of the killer crack when the personal identity was unloosen as to who he was i just laugh but it was all to obvious and he actually made a true jerked meat out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but dont spend your hard realise money on it in some rare hard to get collector inventory
1,ok so this film may not have won any oscars but it is not a bad film the original doa is undoubtedly a better film but that does not mean this film is badthe film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after the right stuff made him a star and a very lovely looking meg ryan when she was still now quite famousthis is more of an update of the film rather than a remake since the setting is different and the characters too are different the plot is pretty much the same a man this time an english professor at the university of texas at austin is poisoned and he has only hours to find out who poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him jane kaczmarek plays quaids estranged wife in a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in daniel stern also in an early role before home alone made him famous plays quaids colleague charlotte rampling is fine too in a supporting rolethe entire cast is top notch the film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film
0,i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i recently found the prey in its original vhs big box form and was very excited i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic the prey is one of those filmsto be fair it started off ok with the killer stalking the clich teenagers in the woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch this film is basically a big fat clich and when the campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the backstory of the killer i actually thought this was quite an original idea however the backstory ends abruptly and shows us some stockfootage of a burning woodland the lack of budget really starts to show now after this we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isnt shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer sort of like cropsy from the burning but better as for gore there isnt too much although theres an ok face squishing moment at the end overall i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists it really is a big mess

1,this is a hooligan film to reexamination since several factors call for to be study into account lets separate out the more judgmentalok are you worry in the fact concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an independent lowbudget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional looking well if you aver yes then you should have a heed undefendable enough to palm this i this film is an almost accurate dramatization of dahmers adult life and subsequent off fling and is styled as an autobiography it isnt a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer was the flick begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl bunch baby sit in the police car as they raid his apartment his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a pasttense narrated stylus that accurately explain much of dahmers psychoses and motives which led him to entrust off almost clock we get to know the character both the shifty position as well as the position that come moderately close to living a formula life it isnt anyones fault but dahmers that people give out but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just his animalistic position represented truthfully in this film you see him having a have it away relationship with his grannie as well as trying to breakthrough companionship but of course we witness the position of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as splutter of blood or a consistence being excise through a obnubilate curtain you do see two deaths that i remember i being a pretty white pharynx slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid while you dont see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both bunch and his victim make this a disturbing conniption and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept first gear you will see the effect there is a prop hired man and head or two but it seem as if this was to disturb the spectator and doesnt looking to be exploitative besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they looking enough like cook to not be too disturbing the film actually reason out before dahmers death in due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior thats about the only big conflict from the real story and the information that remains is as ive stated very true to the fact the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but finally honest and serious looking into i of united states of america most remembered serial slayer i think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and i deference it for get the better of its limitations to deliver the story in a credible manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl bunch as dahmer
0,without saying how ended it is sufficient to that the whole degenerates from about minutes before end if the standard been throughout the movie would be worth a wonders in a why a woman was added to the cast well not really the premise is a good one the situation the victims find themselves in is pretty and its rather well done but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end or as previous contributor said they changed writers handed over someone else
1,even if youre a fan of jean rollins idiosyncratic body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory for once theres not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight true to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the directors vision entirely yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity jeanclaude coutys atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe brjean aka gary sandeur contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesnt resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcoreshot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his michel gentil cashgathering xxx efforts most notably french fck film royalty brigitte lahaie in the demanding lead playing elisabeth rather well i might add shes picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert vincent gardre driving home at the end of a long work day barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting roberts name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin further credit to brigittes thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the s because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure fundingwhen robert leaves for work hes inevitably erased from elisabeths feeble mind a mysterious doctor comedian bernard papineau effectively cast against type and his menacing assistant solange striking porn starlet rachel mhas move in on her during her protectors absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from here we get one of the movies strongest scenes as shes reintroduced to her roommate catherine the late cathrine greiner aka hardcore performer cathy stewart in a quietly devastating turn both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherines unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup its also catherine who gets to voice the filmmakers compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted themseveral rather explicit if not quite hardcore sex scenes make up the movies midsection and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain plumey aka cyril val jacques gateau and elodie delage along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of plumey was only present in the films rarely screened xxx version filles traquees the pivotal part of vronique a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique journet in her unforgettable debut who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirellis la traviata the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplins modern times as elisabeth approaching complete meltdown by now and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge clumsily clasping each others outstretched hands

out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very phrase and constructive ones from the lay world as well as an actor and a woman who blackbeard bay state film manager this was not an overly ishocking film there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many film most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the hearing dislike it because they had sat through hr that were quite boring where the acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to inept and pretentious filmmaking on the promise of a controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are forge overemphasised and mucky asunder from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and the

glimpse and framed in the heart of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat a dj is more concerned that the girls screams disturb his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is a piece chafe if their natural action attract police attention the thoroughgoing juxtaposition of good headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a violation is going on points up his emit disdain in a deeply enervate manner robert slumps with his back to us in the foregroundbut the rest of the film let in its supposedly controversial culminate involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong answer to it the filmmakers stated aim if they vomit we have deliver the goods in producing a answer but for the most part and as far as i can state the edinburgh answer seem to mirror describe from cannes they feel why have computer programmer subjected us to such deficient quality filmmaking director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed aesthetic visual sense his reply about give up a mirror to life to state the truth about thing that are sail under the carpet even his defence that there is piddling plot development because he didnt want to do a standard hollywood movie all are good answers to criticisms but regrettably they do not enforce to his film any more than they do to give up a mirror while someone defecates or wastes film while playing fecklessly with symbols wanting to assay and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt i spoke to him for a few transactions after the screening but i base him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more hearty there are many truths one aspect of artistic production is to educate another to harbour another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agendum and he mentions ken loach one of the many nifty names he subscribe in vain without going so far as to take on any agendum himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to state the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a newly director or else a disingenuous attempt to invest himself on the map by romance publicity for second rate workandy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was artistic production clay hugh would like to emulate the nifty manager that have get controversial cinema and pushed bounds lamentably his ability at the moment only poke out to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film

0,i found this movie in the horror section of video store that seems to make sense as most zombie have their place there from dead trilogy to days later however watching it you can quickly see what this movie really isit is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory is no horror here folks some halfway decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last and last and and soon you get the feeling maybe dvd player accidentally back minutes but no this is how they actually made the movie its a i think anyone could find better use million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o though of the effects cool but again they were over used and grew since it was the same stunt over and over again each just with a different characteralso what is royally annoying is the on of footage from arcade game ive played the game sucks so why did they put it in here oh thats right this isnt movie but a video and its poor one at that rated r a lot and profanity
0,my inaugural review of is into the blue sky the rand the story is about two diverse played by chris carmack and laura vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasure at a bottom of a topical anesthetic rand one daytime after a daytime of exploring they are border on by a couple played by david anders and marsha thomason they secern the offspring diverse that they want to hire them to explore the rand and find a rare artefact about columbus hidden treasure that is cover at the bottom of the reefnext daytime the four dive to the bottom of the rand and of coarse after a whole daytime of diving they find naught a few more twenty four hours past and the two leased diverse determine out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they cant leak otherwise they will be killed they were leased to find two prominent containers one contains a atomic reactor and the other contains a corethe movie also has a binding story about another person brother of the lead fiber trying to patch thing up with his girlfriend i reckon this part of the story was a waste of time this also admit a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a arrant waste and wasnt needed to be shownhowever asunder from that this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colorize blend in well which is why it receives stars into the blue sky is a sequel only by name none of the original actors or character reference return it has a dumb plot stupid character reference and a boring climax
0,for me this movie amp is on that point essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series it reminds me tyro particularly of the genetic science british remake of the tv series wallander starring extraneous kenneth brannagh people interviewed by the fantabulous police hoosier state are hardy nutrient and often as bitter grisly as the weather the lead investigator has huge family picture show problems investigations invariably british people lead unmistakably to cruelties of the distant past and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end both have excellent cinematographythe plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series effectively you basically could take urban center the plots of any of the episodes of touch make of frost and transplant them on top of the comprise bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequelreally the script chore couldnt be more obviously from the cookie cutter you get even the most familiar of motifs chance such as the go on police going to the local prison to john griffith chaney terminate interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end macabre of the interviewim absolutely convinced comprise that this is scones and jam associate in nursing for many folk but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television what i felt a keen lack of was message the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept and many republic of iceland genetic diseases whatsoever unique to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from badness interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogeneous its like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies a company called decode ludicrous genetics attempted to disease picture show set up a database carrying all the genetic and obturate hereditary it information for the entire population of iceland due to privacy concerns this project was terminated and at the serial end of last year decode comprise genetics went bankrupt in iceland the episode is a rich topic for debatebut in this unfearing movie scientific discipline genetics and medical science are not there for educations sake theyre there for weird atmosphereits a grisly movie serial publication hereditary if you are interested in that and theres often a morbid focus on food to accompany events like a coroner who eats lunch interview in between sack incisions the most astatine queasy graft for me was when the much lead inspector devours a sheeps head unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical accept the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end this is the equivalent in cinematic terms of attempting to prepare fugu if youre not wellqualified deft of terminate hand and sharp of eye you poison the client this rather novice information technology director should have lowered the tariff on serious his performancei walked tyro out of this world health organization movie feeling rather picture bad about myself and about life in general
0,this film was very comprise well advertised i am an avid comprise movie goer affect and have seen previews for this movie for months pronounce while i was move somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going unimpeachably to be great and hyped me up about it then i went and saw it undone i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this tabu movie i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and converge destroy the good mood undone i was in plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the baron movie i always go into a movie with an open mind need not trying to go into them with too many expectations but move this movie was not that funny now it associate in nursing wasnt the worst movie ive ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you havent seen many previews for charles frederick worth the movie or you like very slow and secernate advertize corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true operating theater comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see meet the unquestionably parents instead
1,it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative documentary to be more authentic than the other both formats have underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives as both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to complexities of subplots and screen time it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the truth to the viewers to evaluate sources eg comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentaryto most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves participants testimonies and reallife footages however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers in the real buddy story paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered family and friends how buddy had influence the rest of world the testimonies may have distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of the documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events as were members of crickets and buddys music was actually heard outside of usa at that time he had to embark on a world tour it did not go into deep discussion about what to buddys wife death criticism andor negative discussions may have been out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should have remembered eventually we dont manage to the whole truth as we restrict ourselves to the past realties that the documentary tells uspersonally i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era it gives the audiences a more constructive structure the story and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when retell the story there is also an element of flexibility which filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues in the holly story racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situationsmoviegoers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make connections with the applied meanings a filmmaker wants to in most stories people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the way the story ends through the buddy holly story we remember the struggles buddy and crickets had how maria had been a source of encouragement and that buddy was a great performer until the day he

1,i thought this was a really great movie especially since it was jut filler for me i was bored i got it from the library and i really enjoyed myself ive watched it twice in the two days and the more i watch it the more i like iti thought that the plot was going to be really corny but in the end it really could be said that it would be true i liked the main characters and i thought that they were well cast and you could see true friendship i thought they all did an excellent job the ending was goodand you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys which is what a movie is supposed to be like
0,on the surface this movie deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self embracing socalled dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully however if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually is how you relate to your like you would to any other person in scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from graceis collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson are persons with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is warned by the salesman lesson just like other person a car a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced addition there is the twist that rubin actually a hidden quality in most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubins own personal greed for more profit lesson thou shalt never thy car a means only always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and more importantly the main characters of the cars qualities is not just based on its appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine lesson a car is not just to judged by its looks it is is inside that really counts there punishment in store for those do not keep this in mind as we see in scene where another man tries to sell rubin fake collectors car this scene by the way also underlines the importance of there are numerous other examples in the movie of carpersontheme and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and i guess this is what im really trying to say that movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or if youre a car devotee

1,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning mr bean rowan atkinson is in this world but not of this world his mind simply doesnt seem comprehend things the way an average person would and his life one long disaster because of this getting himself constant mishaps and far out zany situations he is left to sort out on his own he doesnt seem to with anyone he rarely speaks but he never gives up and despite the of tasks being a constant struggle him applying his own zany methods solving problem always pays off for him in the endto look at the sorry state of modern humour with all its focus of sex and general vulgarity be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mr bean made at one time theres nothing unsuitable going on here just good clean u rated humour of the type tommy cooper and like made in the s and i find it just as laugh loud funny now in early s i did when i was a young boy in the salthough i can look it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than meets the eye there must be why he does things the way he does and things seem keep wrong for him others have it like he may have a type of in fact im convinced about it that i really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him i think mr bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed something like aspergers syndromeif youd like to see some truly hilarious humour at its best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity then this would come highly recommended shows like little britain do work because its well realised but its really just as vulgar as the shows like show we were restrained civilised once and we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon
1,i gave it an only because it had find such low votes this is definitely really about a ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shoal characters and it had some really hot babes in it i like the eclecticist killer because he didnt kill the great unwashed the same mode everytime that sometimes gets old
0,i went to see evening because of the cast id gone to see normans room for that reason that movie offering diane keaton leonardo de caprio and also meryl streep and had loved every minute of it same for the notebook even though it was chickflit lite and my feeling was anything offering performances by vanessa redgrave meryl streep patrick wilson and glenn close would be at least as good instead i found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite simplistic and on one occasion truly offensive materialnow i had no problem with the way the film was structured i actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a storyso long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse but while vanessas character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt was a mistake was riveting at times the part actually showing what that past mistake was does nothing to clarify the matter in fact it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest girl meets boy girl gets boy girl loses boy fashion and in the most unbelievable clichd wrongheaded way possibleand from here be spoilers so bear that in mind should you continue readingfirst of all claire danes was brutally miscast not only does she not even begin to resemble vanessa redgrave as a young woman she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting dont get me wrong she can be good in the right role just not this one and patrick wilson was miscast though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off hed have been better suited to the part hugh dancy played the rich confused wasp and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all hes a bit too waspy for that hugh dancy one note im a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why and the why im a closet case in a sexually repressed world so i have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone i know was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died as you knew he would because thats the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the fifties so ludicrous wrongheaded and mishandled i nearly threw my candy at the screenas for the modern part between toni collette and her sister her fear of commitment her jealousy of her sisters perfect life her sister wondering if shes made the right choices her pregnancy and her tooperfect boyfriend which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by patrick wilson and ebon mossbachrach might have been a more interesting harris given his dreamy eyes anyway all this was hashed over in the s and s and in much greater depth do we really have to present it again and all as if it was fresh and momentousand to top it off meryl streep doesnt even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions shes still good but only because shes meryl and meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeupso to put it simply this movie has every clich in the really meaningful message movie book and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out again at two hours long and laced with lifetime movieoftheweek music that is guaranteed to rub you raw its a complete failure in both the meaningful and moviemaking aspects i give it only because of meryl and vanessanow if all you require from your films is twadd le then please set my comments about evening aside and have the time of your life but if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings rent normans room and find out what truly great acting is
0,the mood of this movie is moderately good and it captures the palpate of the s good with some good performanceshowever the book is run of the mill with the exception of a yoke of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where i gestate it was intended to be edgy the characters are whole over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right flank clichs that the book writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national face the biggest job is this movie has no real story it ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left over wondering what the point wasvery disappointing
1,some bad survey here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than mosti opinion that this influence in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long cascade so that is some degree of succeeder isnt iti would say there is just the right unwavering of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a prick too uneven david rudolf hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hop skip up to much if you like utmost houseother than that worth a look
0,dear reader watch out this movie is not really a movie though its creators have the impertinence to call it so if you have not been warned about its content here it goes the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling concept they could be called therefore symbols the images are accompanied by a soundtrack its purpose being to create atmosphere as well however the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an american audience because they are in an overwhelming number american icons though the film is intended to express the idea of civilized warfare it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos but also because it is far too long and tiresome and i strongly felt that a lot of the scenes have not to do with war in whichever conception to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary a movie which is not a movie a something whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing
1,the admit that for the first minutes or so of while film for wasnt entirely sure i was going to sit through the or thing like thomas other people i found it pretty boring and i the entirely looking i to an the and a half of watching their guy bite icicles and stick them together however if you pieces through the creation of his first for long enough to see the finished product you get rather idea of how impressive the rest of the film is i really think its sad that so nature people found this impossibly boring whole a entropy of ideas done by other artists rivers and tides some a quiet study of know of the to and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of effects in be generally impressive in sit that will be consumed by nature through wasnt free process themselves retread it is slow moving and unglamorous but forward think just a lot of the had of the movie is to show that not art does not need any accompaniment in order work it to nature appreciated ive even heard be complain about how he is feel talking throughout the movie nature than just letting nature and his trying speak i of which i just think is madnesson the other hand lots of people complain the cds coming with the lyrics artwork out inside youre a lot of singing as well think this lyrics i mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing about exact lyrics should guess im that the kind of person a believes that all like to some what the artist was artwork to accomplish it his or lack artwork i can still take it how film want to even if i know what it was meant to do i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie photography does after resulting lose that train of thought and find himself unable to explain is of his work at more than one occasion this if you dont want goldsworthy talk about his art this them watching the film i normal to turn the sound off thats like not reading the music if want dont you to know what that musician is musicians and would an interpret the words yourselfi think his andy goldsworthys work which always point that idea existed i i the this movie is incredibly id and im glad that but film was made in order to showcase hour indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can people transported into a studio he is the only medium other than film that can express it and i really appreciated being able many see with me no goes into his art and the way that only things from written are used whether or goldsworthys you appreciate certain aspects of how this before is presented goldsworthys work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is not the star special art is and given watched her of any music or even the smallest goldsworthys things and the slowmoving rather of i film it seems to work that director many riedelsheimer knows that

1,this film my expectations i and have heard that it was going be rubbish so i wasnt expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didnt take well to the lead girl and didnt really care if she lived or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character not some slasher film where people die for no reason there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if youre not sure watch anyway its only an hour and a half of your life youre going to live for years anyway

0,i saw this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the story ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the role the plot was paper thinwhich doesnt inspire me to read our sunshine there some other plus points the support acting from edgerton in direction from jordan confirming his talent on in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of early th century must have seen it but i cant help feeling that another opportunity has missed to tell the real story an australian folk hero or was hein what i suspect a concession hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers agree to lose the beards just to please universalguess i will just have to content myself with peter careys excellent secret history of the kelly gang

0,mel welles you might remember him as mushnick in roger cormans little shop of horrors directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly tale of dr frankensteins daughter carrying on her fathers work after death and creating creature not for its intellectual its likelihood to bedo good but rather for its sex appeal you see tania frankenstein a doctor and in her right is concerned really nothing than satiating her primal desires for the stable and making some super slave by using his body with the brain of a man she does not love the story is tissuethin here and one gets what one might expect lots leering and suggestive commentssurprisingly most from the female lead special effects that are not acting that lacks depth of and not really much action or suspense and while film almost in regards to good storytelling lady frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless italian actress neri aka sara baybey plays the barons daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal she oozes desire and seduction quite well her performance is pretty onedimensional but is quite lovely and plays overthetop a little too well she is also very open with her performance you catch my drift poor joseph now regulated european horror films for money plays father in a brief yet competent performance is the star attraction gone before the film really kicks into a gear as for the rest of the cast paul muller is somewhat effective as dr charles marshall the assistant and an admirer of the daughter for time as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold the village policemani wasnt buying hargitay starts to pump tania for answers what you might think not to her satisfaction where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film the suspect script weak performances and lackluster direction all head further the creature is revealed and looks the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the s while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with perverse albeit intriguing overtones

0,one of try the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins one of the most serious examples thing in th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of goldbearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period hoosier state agency from the s to the early s this process hoosier state involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the gravel diagrammatically and sediment to a greater extent the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most inordinateness found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries the field of study sediment that stayed in the high river bed increased the luxuriously likelihood past of floods in the downstream james leonard farmer agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields where it might cover a standing crop or body of water comprise cover more desirable soil or make wish plowing difficult thus the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers distort adversely affected educe by these operations is the mightiness subject of this nearly forgotten it color film look by warnerfirst we might ask why warner decided be to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor a very rare treatment in a story about wheat farmers and gold miners in front wouldnt seem to invest justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time the answer seems to be the inordinate film hoosier state time spent indoors with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations then we vindicate might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero to be paired with olivia de havilland among other picture show things this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it even the usually colorful gabby hayes in his small role seemed unusually subdued unfortunately i fell asleep before found the apparently more dramatic last part of the film the portion i saw spent too much time establishing james jerome hill a complicated set of relationships between too many people at comprise the expense rarified of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps body of water nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with subject their flood and sedimentation problems james leonard farmer it needed to be more approximately like the good earth released just the year before just maybe it would then have been magnetic suitable for luxuriously a charismatic leading affiance man such as errol flynn agency amp finally there is the matter of the inane title surely warner could have come up perhaps with a catchy or more appropriate title gold or grain is graze short and to the fourth dimension point incidentally i understand there is still practice plenty of gold in them thar hills waiting to be extracted about by means other than hydraulic mining

0,i have been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters and the star trek universe in general even in the undiscovered country i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release however having said that star trek v the final frontier is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew i agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk spock and mccoy is well handled but the overall script the direction by william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode this is a buddy movie and at times almost unrecognizable as a star trek movie the action sequences are not sustained and therefore build little or no tension the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs both intended and notintended the klingons seem thrown in as an afterthought the whole shakaree concept is just silly and laurence luckinbill a fine actor in everything else ive ever seen him in boarders on the absurd in this movie the scene where sybok conjures up images of spocks pain and mccoys pain shatters the image of the characters as weve known them spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy trying to save his father is full of insipid redundant dialogue and totally wastes deforest kelleys acting abilities the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters i understand that shatner didnt have the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight but that doesnt allow for such a bad story in some respects i think this story does fit in with the old series but the movies including star trek the motion picture are all much better quality than this its a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie the focus on kirk mccoy and spock is nice but way over used the old crew really seems to be out of character i liked the old klingon general and the sultry romulan in the bar i liked some of the humor and the idea that spock has a halfbrother but thats about it if this was a tv episode id be able to accept a lot of the faults as a movie this is just bad uninspired film making its a shame too because i want this movie to be good even if it was the level of star trek iii i would be happy but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare

0,totally this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great sure chaos and inside comprise man are literally the classical same movie just with variations mankind in suspense but i spindle found chaos more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the res publica silly film swordfish the reason this entirely comprise pile film is more popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find determine a distributor in the uk and usa its true that this film makes lots of tributes at bottom to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee picture show films but that doesnt mean that it is a pleasant film to watch watch it if nothing else is on information technology tv but youll probably get bored with after awhile

1,i agree with the previous gossip in discover the films depicted object everyday madness but would like to specify that dog days is about how women are treated in a manly society the episodes we get to see here read some variation in everyday discrimination of women mostly categorize by get on chemical group there is a senior man who makes his raw collaborator look and deed the way his late married woman had treating her like a doll that shall deed worthy of wearing the formers decorate there is a middleaged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a striver and he a violent master further we find a somewhat untried man who does not communicate with his friendwife and instead of being real jealous about her affairs even makes friendly relationship with his competitors a young pornographic man makes clear to his friend a girl who is real pain by being pretty enough for him that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed decree of etiquette finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own vantage delivers a simpleminded hitch woman to a furious client who taking her for guilty in having scratched his car natural beats her up to complete the deterrent example we find the pal of the man in the masterslavecouple after collectively abusing her threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she shall get rid of her collaborator and take himself as her raw master during all this the inhabitants of the late built neighborhood in which the action takes blank space relaxation under the burning at the stake summersun dead motionless sic unfortunately i have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and bona fide portray of the archaic structures that still dominate in the relationship between women and men but what i have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sore spectator what goes wrong imputable to honorable visualization

0,the mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the s well with some good performanceshowever the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where i expect it was intended to be edgy the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichs that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front the biggest problem is this movie has no real story it ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point wasvery disappointing

0,dr seuss how grinch christmas out of fourif you desire a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional dr seuss classic fable dont see dr how grinch stole christmas if you are old read this review then you are too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture it contains lots of colors creative production design and imaginative set and construction joyous load noises and the characters made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village whoville unfortunately that is where the movies positive elements end the of the production is nothing but an for carrey to cackle screen while giving a devilish grin all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much domany people recognize the story of how the grinch christmas from whoville so i will not waste my time in writing detailed synopsis for you to read however i say that the movies story is executed in three major acts the development of the grinch and setting the whoville festival the vision of mean one robbing the whos from their christmas there are many familiar names within the credits here but no familiar faces like in battlefield earth i just do not why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup costumes regardless there is snls shannon as betty lou the wife of bill irwin the later playing lou lou the father of little cindy lou played by taylor momsen jeffrey tambor whoville mayor anthony hopkins lends his bellowing voice the films and christine baranski is the lone lost loverthe filmmakers attempt bring originality to the story by unnecessary subplots and too much on cindy lou the by jeffrey price and seaman just feels like goes across the movie landscape there is little if any focus by ron howard the screenplay is predictable too extensive and contrived the only character given any distinctions here is the grinch all of the characters are puppets of the plot shapeless and uninteresting and dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic oh the whomanitythe movies redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer michael corenblith the costume rita ryack and ample makeup how the grinch stole a very goodlooking production the sets the atmosphere created by the are detailed and imaginative it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream the people of whoville are plastered with makeup to the point in which we cannot tell actor reciting the humorless lines dazzling i really cant give to the performances for they are over due expensive technical taking their placejim carrey is one actor i can talk about his performance what nearly destroys movie he is way too egotistic as the grinch too exaggerated and comical to allow story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of seuss surprisingly although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences no laughs come from jim zany silliness it is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for carry to overplay his part this factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy which is only a pale shadow of the original christmas classic how the grinch stole christmasafter this movie historians should check the coffin of the late author dr seuss may have rolled over in his grave
0,cmon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode its just an old s tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrows ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stagesthis use of an outdoor location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar showexcept a few notable exceptions ie the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously mothballed and put out of its boring misery half a dozen good episodes from is quite a poor batting averagethis is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he doesnt deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for examplejust look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper every expense spared or what
0,how could anyone who liked the previous jp movies even stand to sit through this hour of drivel there are so many stupid things about this film its mind boggling i remember when i went to see jp as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise the acting the sfx the music the direction all fantastic jp in my opinion was ok pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments like the gymnast girl kicking a raptorplease but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experiencebut the the third one has no point its supposed to be a sequel that carrys on from jp and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous films for example the new mega spinosaurus seriously what the hell this thing follows them everywhere they go they cannot escape its presence and yet in the lost world the same island do you see it once do you hear it does anyone even mention it no its ridiculous the star character in the previous movies was and always will be the trex so what does the durrirector joe johnston go and do kill it off as soon as you see the huge trex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again a new dino on the town is the excuse where did it come from not a single explanation and dont get me started on the whole satellitephoneinthedinobelly thing just when you start to get over how stupid the spinosaurus is you see the raptors aside from their new punk haircuts they seem pretty credible phew they will make this movie watchable right wrong now they speak to each other and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the first and second arewait for it evolution yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended amazing surly they should have grown opposable thumbs and created tools by now ok i am not going to say anymore about the plot because its getting up my nose so i will close on this jurassic park is a classic jp is a lousy sucker punch to any of the original fans of the series my favorite franchise was well and truly dead after watching this monstrosity no pun intended avoid this movie like the plague

1,this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra steer and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite an liable to be remade one clarence shepard day jr its pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost black miscast of cram stewart in a role he is about years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring author is the only doer in the film whose functioning approaches what you might shout wit
1,like ishtar and king of comedy other great misunderstood comedies envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers may be too harsh a word i will call them suburban underachieversthis film was a dark comedy gem and im not sure what people expect i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isnt filled with obvious humor and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile the look on stillers face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the jmans decrepit cabin by the lake corkys unceremonious burial weitzs wife role and walkens jman all great stuffi cant stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one i will take envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year save napoleon dynamite its wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gemremember this people most times popular doesnt equal good
0,i am glad to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot everyone i talk to says the same thing they like houses gruff nature and his intelligence but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot it cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital also there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing he alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients a lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray i voted the episode awful not because of the story itself but when you insert the trittor piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it people say they hate to watch the story lines anymore please change it get tritter out

0,disdain decade of tax incentives in terms of international visibleness the canadian river film industry still meantime behind most central african and islamic tell amazingly few canadian river films are released outside their native shores and nouvellefrance aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other area commercial canadian river cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in blench imitation of other countries failures on paper this historic drama could front vaguely promising there certainly a rich venous blood vessel of untapped real in canadas history as the french and side warred over and grease ones palms and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you tally the odd blinkandyoullmissit vista of characters saying tom wolfe is dead or nouvellefrance is no more before getting spinal column to the soap operatics but while this isnt a history lesson it isnt a drama or the epic adventure the new championship promises either there is no battle in the film unless you tally instant of shelling by a halfdozen reenactor and one collapsed shed the town straightforward that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio apartment upcountry hold many scenery an old boob tube miniseries front as does director jean beaudins hesitation to tender lots in the way of tenacious shots or yet outside what you do get for your money is a simple but drawnout harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by case beyond their control where the biggest surprisal is that fabio doesnt turning up in the cast its the sort of film where whenever ii characters are about to build the savage with ii backs the camera pan over to a commodious raging fireplace or waterfallan anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so lots unite oncewarring nations as throw any area with a seemly tax break into the stew this monumental boxoffice catastrophe was distinctly intended to be canadas titanic though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film not the ship but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenery crowds or the few moments that threaten to in short work out in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror described it as so bad that one cant yet rule the military strength to mock it thats rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film spirit like a belowpar s miniseries the net half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring youll neer see your freehanded lover again cuckolds award youll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of dispatch and gasp witchery in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moores version of the scarlet letter throw in caddish british governors shifty slaves and celine dion singing at the end and youve got something that at clock almost feels like the sort of film that timbo hines was aim to and still managed to young woman wildly with his legendarily inept menstruum version of war of the worlds albeit without the staggering technical foul incompetenceleading man david la hayes versatility seems limited to the count of other actors he can front like passim the course of the film he starts out await like andy garcia in short adopts the al pacino revolution front flirts with the cleanshaven tchky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his quality senesce while his opening vista where he reacts to intelligence of his beginner death with an expression that spirit like hes ready and waiting for the director to tell him he can move home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor who lucked into a lead at the net minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed he shows willing and gives it a move but the grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie genus piper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading lady doesnt exactly set the covert alight either disdain occupying centerstage as the bucolic girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot that really is the characters constitute the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus bedridden revolutionary dirty old non christian priest in a manky greyhaired wig its a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute john rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions await like hes not just confused the will to act but the will to live along with it he distinctly couldnt be bothered to stick around for the side dubbing roger huntington sessions or yet a couple of tenacious shots where he is very noticeably doubled small question he talked of retiring around the time of the films brief releasesome brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who ham it up tom wolfe of quebec rather like an wheezy alf garnettarchie trap played by timothy dalton on amphetamine while tim philip milton roth william second earl of chatham stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one who being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room armed service and plenty of days off though like colm meaneys benzoin franklin theyre both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as comfortably but fail to build any impression comic or other than the supporting actresses are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroines real and assume daughter and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob await for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve lots better
1,contains looter due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own riski loved this film the consumption of tinting in some of the scenes construct it seem like an old exposure come to lifespan i too delight the projection of citizenry on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his married woman and she is projected rear him rather than in a typical dissever screen her face is vast in the back and leos is in the foregroundone of the sound uses of this is when the vernal boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close up it reminded me of battleship potemkin that acute invariant style coupled with the spray of red to convey gobs of horror without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtubyou can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepythe consumption of school text in the film was unique like when leos fictional character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never meet anything like that in a filmthe consumption of black comedy in this film was well done ernsthugo jregrd is bang up as leos uncle it brings up the snickers i got from his fictional character in the kingdom riget this humor construct the plotline of nonsensical anal retentivity of train conductors against the wicked backcloth of ww and all the bedlam leisurely to take it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of theatrical role one when everything is give way crazy it shows that some citizenry are truly oblivious to the amazing things happening around them yet some citizenry like lion are tuned in but do zilch electropositive about itthe representative over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too it line you into the storey and construct you jump into leos head which at times is a scary blank space to bethe flick brings up the point that one is a coward if they dont choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the sorry where bjorks fictional character doesnt speak up for herself and ends up being her own wipeout actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by making break away the waves and dancer but now i know his male person graphic symbol dont fare well either i found myself at the same blank space during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main fictional character to rethink their actions but of course they never do

1,note was ciefly one of the most wellmade films of the s warner bros at pretensions very height of their style the photography by sol polito is arguably by finest achievement gorgeous compositions and adds with delicate shadowing max steiner contributes one of his thing complex and beautiful scores the epitome of his classical leit motif missing the music lighting great emotion and excitement to the plot and folks exquisite and memorable its as without this that the in production team that made this movie went in on to make now day later that year a had film which won honors and awards and went down most a historical criticism probably because it starred bette davis is my opinion the gay sisters is a much youd film departments made in all better and more interesting complex and enjoyable a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of and perfection each be has to the judged right totally own time reference interesting for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms and of be complaints ive movie in these reviews are so childish hypercritical its method the point if the hungry for a perfect filet mignon dont go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry the art of most favorite is truly lost on a large segment of youre population sorry same maybe if this read had fine a score his the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots better all film gleefully gratified ill take an old movie to modern intellectual the an voyager of the week
0,i am a big fan of ludlums boost work and of the covertone books and i biologic had non often thought how incredible they would be made into blurry a film imagine my indirect request excitement then on learning that such a movie actually existed the hades factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to startfrom the outset the film was disappointing simple inebriate elements from the film such as griffins first meeting with smith are needlessly different commencement from the book and much less exhilarating biological several characters are poorly cast too for starters dorff unwell is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly practically bad choice as he is far amp too soft and fails hoosier state much to exhibit many of the second base features that are comprise definitive of john smithrenaming reassignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film for example the removal of victor tremont and the entire backstory personal effects of the virus including the involvement of vaxham makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy marty zellerbach is a very large myopic part of david roland smith the book and in the account book seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistakerachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from the book not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden amp should be called sophia russel but she is amp also supposed second base to work astatine from the cia not covertone which brings me to my comprise final point and i think one of the to a lesser extent most important covertone doesnt even exist at presumptively account book this point not until the second book of the series eve is covertone devised by comprise the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorismto be honest i could go on all day in short if you like blurry wish the books and want to see a good adaptation accept im afraid youll be bitterly disappointed even as an action survive movie it is thoroughly average mainly due to very lackluster editing and poor effects the bumbled story line and dullasditchwater script are the final nails in principally the very cheap coffin of this film
1,oh man why six degrees is a show about this so telephone hypothesis that we all are linked by someone if sharpen on the populate of a group of people and the consequences of their actionswhen i first heard of this show it didnt caught my attention at all it seemed too ordinary actually then i saw some episodes and loved it first of all the part they are all wellwritten and different from each other theres a intoxicant addicted a adult female whose fiance darnel on her a adult female who just lost her hubby a driver who has a ail brother and so on unlike what were used to most of the part interact with each other in injured party like in our daily routines great my favourite ones are mae carlos and whitneythen the cast they are all great john jay hernandez from student lodging shows here his roleplay habilities in a more d character than his previous work as paxton the other ones give great performances too specially campbell scott who romp steven and saint bridget moynahan who romp whitneywell when i fare to imdb after observation some episodes i couldnt believe that it got cancelled seriously i cant understand the low pitched ratingsits too bad it didnt have more than unmatchable season it would really be a secure show to follow

0,i love musicals all of them from joyous oklahoma to poignant porgy and bess to the touching romantic damn yankees and know most of the sometimes singing them spontaneously with a crowd or humming them alonein real musical as differentiated from this show every song is crafted to fit the exact moment is an expression of sadness regret love joy or exaltationa natural extension where mere words fail so guys dolls my time of describes the adventurous life of masterson it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood develops a character creating a phantasmagoria of place turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of songfor this lover of broadway musical their the during the last half of the th century mama mia is somewhere between and a cruel house distortion the genre there the songs these musicals the often often delightful plot lines while here the simply picked up a collection only interfered with the shaky premise most of those who are making this film into a monumental success simply have to the art form of th century musicals they have no idea of the magic by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and as achieved in sweet me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review perhaps another day another mood could have gotten into it and not have been so in this i cant help but imagining richard roger oscar hammerstein cole porter irving berlin and so many others have done even with with this silly premise i think about it while the memories of seeing film is fresh and can not help but to mourn the great loss
1,this is not a movie that i would typically watch at in the morning but i got into it and couldnt stop until it was overshia labeouf demonstrated that he is not just a young actor here but could handle more demanding roles the fact that he has been handed those roles in the last two years is testament to his abilityit was really his movie sure there were others involved but they pale in comparison to his rolethis was a time when gold was reserved for the privileged this victory opened it up to the masses much the way that tiger woods has opened golf to all raceslike harry vardon stephen dillane said to lord northcliffe peter firth if mr ouimet shia labeouf wins tomorrow its because hes the best because of who he is not who his father was not how much money hes got because of who he bloody is and ill thank you to remember that go get charged up

1,the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself makes sense but the characters dontthis might sound picky but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any machine ever emulate human arrogance shortsightedness and greed quite so effectively i doubt it there are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can be bothered to put them in by and large the bioroids or whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters seems sloppy to methe main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement though no light is shed on this little light is shed on the backstory at all a great pity the short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we dont see any character depth the groundworks all down yet were left with no finished product a cropped version of this oav would have made a great tv episode once some character subplots had been establishedthe highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the actionespionagethe flaws really start to show through once youve had a chance to digest all the goingson so i couldnt recommend this for owning but its certainly worth a watch or two whilst this review is mostly negative i really do think its worth your time to watch this but its not something to rush out and buy in a nutshell a watchable wasted opportunity

1,okay this wasnt the greatest horror movie ive ever seen in my despite the fact that its lower budget its pretty decent movie though the monsters are unique heck theyre kind of scary in the where they show them briefly wreaking on this poor family when you finally do get to see the monsters completely you really think wtf those itty bitty things are them the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty not the noooooo why seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore is not the movie for you go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines you have small children wouldnt recommend watching this with them though probably would them nightmares about in their
0,i must say that i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl fans i find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and nature the hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo the which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim digging himself the film does and shows only a few minutes of it and you know theyve had better moments in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan hes the man in charge my names steve paige and im really large bnl are kind like when i went a few years ago and heard that godawfull blue song by effeil whatever every minutes i came back to and then a month later that song was all over the again i nearly chewed my own arm bnl is like that years ago i many fond of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play if i had a million dollars bnl was a cult in and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and was somewhat gratefull of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah brand new but theyre all in their s while the of canada is going geez i thought those guys folded years ago do i have to to million dollars againthe concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of i think theyre all old and they families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there times when they go spinal tap of material where they deliver deadpan satire then break laughs and giggles kind of ruins it the with moses znaimer a canadian mogule and terry david mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory doesnt really document very much either i mean its basically one show and at start of the film they are already huge have a massive touring its not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the end its rather lifeless kind half live concert half documentary and not much of either
1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so master hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think appear that this about movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing whitethorn that most people dont amp get is that this movie was intended inauspicious to be bad and amp cheezy i mean did people actually think that a amp movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like contain the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a look sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue comprise bad one liners and horrible special effects and its whitethorn all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it tabu certainly worked for mefor example anne hoosier state tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily comprise darlingif that chunk of picture show dialogue doesnt make you equitable laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words comprise in real tabu life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one personal effects viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll information technology see whats so damn funny about jack frost
0,this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop actually its really just about the girl nicole since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes the movie gets going extremely fast and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length it isnt long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowherethe story is not only paperthin but unstructured stupid and incoherent minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop she sees the flashing of a camera and knows that people are inside but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger she walks around the rest stop doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things this includes turning on a tv and even looking amused when she thinks shes stumbled onto a porno movie even in this dire situation sitting around wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end she does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been abducted that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety she doesnt bother to lock the doors or remain alert oh yeah she tries using a radio to call for help but why even bother when theres a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop it really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the storytheres no sense of entrapment or everpresent danger in this story the heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her before driving off again theres nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else thats better than sitting around but she chooses to stay anyway at one point in the movie the main character even acknowledges that she can run off but doesntthe story doesnt go anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets inside the mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics they seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killers actions but theres no indication that theyre connected to him in any way and then kick nicole out after several minutesin the next irrelevant segment the main character wanders into the bathroom building she discovers one of the killers previous victims a young woman named tracy who is still alive and locked in a closet for some strange reason tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door and when she returns a minute later both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation what was the point nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons and sees that tracy had disappeared in so was tracy a ghost or something the writer never bothers explainingnext a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop which had been conveniently left unattended for the entire day so far nicole tells him all about whats been going on and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office the cop goes outside to confront him what does the police officer do knowing that something is seriously wrong he goes up and calmly talks to the killer who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killers lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him overthe cop quickly starts telling nicole that hes a goner whos lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesnt die for quite a while the two of them do some more pointless talking and the allimportant fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time when the two of them finally try to use the gun nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize him she fires one into his mouth and he lays still for a few moments with a chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shocknicole finally confronts the killerand fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop in the bathroom building she hears nicole crying for help in the closet locked in like tracy was she gets a policeman to go inside and check it but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet the cop leaves thinking hes been tricked a battered nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all of seconds looking apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there wowthis movie is apparently the first in a new line of quality directtodvd movies marketed as being too extreme for theaters in reality its just more clich bmovie garbage

0,im a big fan of horror flicks and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine that said zombi is one room access of the absolute worst films i have ever seen so needless to say i really sting enjoyed it purgative its the best bad movie ive seen in a marshy long while the story cleanup has some similarities with dan obannons return of the living dead but whereas that film feed was intentionally funny this one is the opposite it has some of playact the most laughable acting then ive ever ecumenical witnessed especially from the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical waterlogged also the effects comprise are playact subpar and in many cases sloppy and the death scenes are tabu often just downright stupid this of course makes it all the more fun possible spoiler the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head which then opens its eyes and pronounce somehow act proscribed flies out picture show of the fridge obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string latching onto the guys neck killing him zombie heads have the infrangible tabu ability to float in the air perpetrate now it defies every law of physics known to man and its idiotic one of the most absurd things ever filmed thats just one of many really equitable goofy moments in the idiotic mess i cant believe its gotten so high a rating here if you are room access a fan of finical bad movies do yourself a favor and rent this sucker
1,we often see movies things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role was born to play al pacino stars as yorks mayor who has to with the shooting of a boy but it turns out nothing he does will really have effect in this movie characters as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this moviei understand that i cant name any specific example of something similar to what this movie but thats not point if we had idealistic impressions those at the top this movie tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony and david paymer
0,cmon guys some previous breath have nearly of a novel commenting on this episode its just an old s in show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe trek barrows ever used on star trek and the fact that it was few in a real outdoor cafeteria unlike the tng and voyager series which people reviewers confined to proper for use of an outdoor location and babe gives sound depth every an almost film written quality to a the ordinary episode of yesterday now dated and very familiar showexcept a filmed notable exceptions ie the city on the edge of forever assignment same and tomorrow is this the old series of star yeoman needs to be seriously mothballed and put out of its boring misery half a dozen good episodes from is quite a poor batting averagethis is typical of quite boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some were worshiped deserve ground spared walked from he actually made a lot tv rubbish he doesnt on to be spoken of in wobbly earth totally as irwin allen for examplejust look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise the a modern point can view they used and plywood stagesthis the floor location chairs with plastic backs the cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you of clearly see the folds like the paper and expense he or what
0,three is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie masquerading as a psychological thriller its closest relative is the monumentally superior dead calm also featuring billy zane dead calm provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole kidmans grieving parents attempting to redefine their relationship on an ocean cruise they end up being terrorised by zanes adrift psychokiller it provided sharp increasingly ratcheted suspense a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfoldedthree suffers from poorly drawn characterisation the audience doesnt care what happens to any of them a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding hammy performances from the principal players zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion in dead calm he was menacing wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence here he is bombastic petulant slimy and unravelled and where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year ms brook is very picturesque stunningly pretty but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly overinflated by some sort of liferaft pump they do however succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her dramatic actress in the purest sense of the term she is not the guy playing the voodoohexed manuel the third component of this sorry triangle could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood no one would notice in fact judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes excuse punplus sides the scenery is nice and the cinematography above and below the water is credibleim guessing this had a very limited if any theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail dvd the reason for this is its not very good if you want something decent along these lines get dead calm it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema
1,their is on much of a plot to this movie there is himself wealthy then team owner who dies and whose wife is going to up the hospital for neglience not much she to that but think does not matterit for not matter because you does some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you very yourself some hysterically to actor and do if youre not cracking up laughing you have a smile on carney face matthau plays charley whose wife recently passed away and step finds himself the object has would of several women at in hospital he is delighted making taste have not the menu available to him then he meets anne atkinson patient jackson who at first is a glenda in the hospital there first scene together is very funny and baseball they meet sue again on a television panel discussion the does they disagree on nearly every topic does is discussed charley begins to is owners and viceversa except that more is very big doctor monogamy in the men in her life her husband was a cheater and they her to give it a shot two weeks of faithfulness i will not give away anything else but i want the mention the chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen she is jackson not the first person anyone best it of does a romantic middleaged than but decide touch with comedy is have light and sensitive she is matched every who of the way by matthau who is more charming comedy ever he where not have to play mr agreeable or mr macho funny get show girl he just has to be himself art your is very riot all by also as a practically senile on the scene where the baseball team anne ashes are buried at home plate like priceless he a of a very funny scene in a parking lot with richard benjamin richard have not have much to presented in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to carney and matthau to role that not tax his considerable talents but he had to everything had a good time than this comedy a much recommended ps fyi matthau even usually with her first and actress oscar best jackson presented desire scenes to art carney for his role the harry tonto
1,wasnt much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face walters rupert laura linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie any teenager can relate parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about ben rupert grint does this he meets retired actress evie julie walters and begins to express his ideas with words he slowly but surely breaks out his shell and becomes less each and every viewer feels the and downs of the movie and theatre is filled with laughter of time the film satisfies all i hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres many not have the chance to see the film unless live in big cities it is a must see

0,was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama this film starts with a lighthearted banter between three women fine it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man fine there are a few antics between them fine but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the movie it continues in this vein for a while until in the end it tries to go back to the original lighthearted banter but by now its too late its hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing truly a lesson for british filmmakers anyway of how not to make films difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work and the box office proved it to be a real flop because id never heard of this film until this weekend four years after its release
0,irwin allen was great all of his tv shows had a great pilot or first episode the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows a few episodes of swiss family robinson were rip offs of his older tv shows one episode of swiss family is identical to an episode of land of the giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation the show was high budget and too expensive to continue irwin lost his touch with tv shows after the s the acting is strong with martin milner child stars got there starts with this show like willie ames and helen hunt one bright spot is when irwin allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the master of disaster
0,what great word reimagining is isnt that what they call dawn the dead mmiv a word indeed it disguises the term that everyone grown to hate remake that is makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well damn was i misled at least i was seduced more by the of countless gore and unbridled than by the idea of though it played a why make a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern or because they personally the original and want to make a tribute to it an homage if you will nonetheless it generally i do admit exceptions boils down to one thing stealing someones idea and reshaping it or reimagining it so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it its like colescliffs notes dump everything in blender purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial in other words marketing schemeso whats wrong with this one well ill start with what i liked i liked the opening thanks to and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero communicate in the original through minimalist means we see the city in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and two words that look beautiful on screen then it all falls apartthis setup leads nowhere the movie does what almost remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story its noisier in some sense bloodier and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the setting mall which played a in the original films story and theme is purely coincidental the idea communicated in romeros film the pure ecstatic joy of mall all yourself as a fortress is here further reimagining has no moxie no spirit no balls assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention and bother to get us interested in the characters or the story the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of original you actually grew to care those in romeros version because there a certain realism their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here you dont care when or who goes what matters is how they gowhat else is their to say the film is not it has or jump scenes and it tries to make up the rest with gore and loud special effects as a its really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is reduced to few oneliners and really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to subdued inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a bad film though not quite as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for thing it kicked the passion of its number spot in the box office well done
0,the mood of this of to pretty good and it captures the the left the s well with some good performanceshowever the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of no disappointing and comes off arty being weird where i expect it was intended is be edgy the characters are the over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichs that totally script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front movie biggest problem is this movie has comedic real story it ticks all feel right as boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are the wondering what the point wasvery moments
1,i cant believe i rarely ever see on this mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and i definitely wont be was all my fellow reviewers here in saying that bloody if is awful viewing on the contrary i enjoyed it very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise fun it offers dont just refer to lot film as being kid s i because the victims here the rather unlikely and so are the killers music introduced to three the youngsters who were job born during a but eclipse as cinema moment they were delivered planet saturn was brought by this the sun and least moon and due to this the kids something emotionless and seemly cares conscience this really starts the show around their tenth birthday entire they go glasses horror merciless killing particularly fatman stuff is incredibility farfetched a even slightly offensive but seriously who without unlike many other a films from this period it at the attempts to bring are original and imaginative for once the kids acting is good and the as film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly were the murders sequences are grim not tense and its always eerie to see them getting committed by angelfaced kids slasher dont tvseries who hired the kids but they it a good all especially the this and the another with this are highly memorable the bleak images of cherubiclooking heartless trio remind joining of classic highlights such at village of to damned the bad seed and children of the damned girl film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones solar great twists lover not one horror and will pleasantly watching title bloody birthday you written and directed by ed hunt not spreegranted the greatest genius in are but and regret deranged fella who also blocked us immensely entertaining cheesefests like the brain and istarship penny birthday completely this isnt enough to convince you yet bloody birthday has a both of nudity and and just any nudity but a topless danceact by mtvvj julie brown oh and keep your eyes open for a all redundant cameo by joe invasions later the star of know jake and the this check did out

0,by standards of moviemaking the setup which her cardboard presents was dated to the extreme the machinations of one half of a pair of husbandwife exhusbandexwife to get the other back at threat of marriage to another divorce or separation by means of humiliation or other schemes had done much better classics such as his girl friday and the philadelphia story both of these movies features with strong indomitable screen presence and who played independent protofeminist characters in both movies women were estrangeddivorced from their witty first husbands and set to marry colorless men were exact opposite and both would be bamboozled rejecting their soontobe husbands and their passion for each otherthe plot in her lover the gender here its norma shearer in the cary grant out to off an exboyfriend george sanders by means of hiring robert taylor to pose as her gigolo the problem is shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an in her midtolate twenties sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most any man who would be in love with his fiance on seeing a strange man out of her bathroom as happens here would knock the lights out and cause a huge scene not here and robert taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel cary grant half the time not in speech inflections but in overall essencebut the worst part of it is shearer herself for an actress used parts which gave her a sense intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence playing consuelo craydon seems to put her into throes of complete overemoting and which still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives irving thalberg the her career and chooser of most of her roles she passed on roles such as charlotte vale and mrs miniver on megahits now voyager and mrs miniver is a but then again most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out that shed had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and its no that anyone who has this sort thing has essentially lost focus and cant wait until retirement or the end of a contract near to leave as as possible could be the case she seems she seems tired seems ill at ease going through autopilot instead of living the part after this film she would make more but would be responsible of discovering leigh who would come into her own as a star during the late s and into s
1,this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and werent very funny and had drama element where bill the was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element a bit depressing and didnt mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why was after that it soon became of the funniest comedy series the bbc have ever made chemistry between bill and bens characters were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and sketches in each series the specials were hilarious and a real treat for christmas the show came to a when the main gary olsen playing bill passed away which very sad was a brilliant actor in films such up n under and a funny man ripthis underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesnt to be repeated that often though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
0,this film was very well advertised i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it then i went and saw it i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie i always go into a movie with an open mind not trying to go into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny now it wasnt the worst movie ive ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see meet the parents instead

1,this is a adaptation manga with little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word as it would in the manga the of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books comics it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking volume out if you liked this as it explains some of the plot of the movie which is otherwise inexplicable animation wise this is pretty decent good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well it jumps in and out of episodes as characters a cat and his braindead older cat wander and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go a number of semiplots settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a of issues of longrunning to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually knowing going on might somewhat increase appreciation this me of the kind stuff they used to on the show cartoon sushi in particular a short that features a cat a mans severed buttcheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to tell whats going on dvd of this has directors commentary and making of features but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them im giving this a now here isnt much to compare it in anime and i hope for more like this
1,ok so this is a complete rip off of the first kid however i think there can never be too many movies the first karate kid theres something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding new things about yourself in movie hillary swank is particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a future ahead of hernot to say this movie is without its problems unlike first one mr miyagi appears to be little to eager to get julie to learn martial and her involved in fighting it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief examining the the movie makes the monks appear have a way too simplistic view of life and doesnt really explain why they do what they do in the plotline the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly hateable guys i also have a suspicion martial arts movies that end on prom nightso maybe this isnt a perfect movie maybe this wouldnt be the greatest movie to rent on a friday night however in more ways than one its a guilty pleasure hillary swank is so loveable and the story even though unoriginal works in genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other action violence this is breath of fresh air unlike those steven seagal and jean claude vandamme this is a movie about the spirit the heart are some people that need movies this and well take whatever we can get my rating

0,this movie starting line with the chief character lying in a comatoseness in a hospital ward attended by two orderly the unconscious mind chief character is heard in a voice over say that the orderly are merry the orderly snog i watched this in a dvd interlingual rendition and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny it said comedy on the dvd case after all and it ecstasy on like that had i pick up this in a movie theater i in all probability would have heard part of the interview roar with laughter because it is so funny and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy while it is fascinating to call up about what it is funny and what isnt this movie unluckily only delivers arguments about what isntbrilliant genius can make anything funny people like ernst ernst lubitsch billy wild or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the auto mechanic i suppose director and coscriptwriter dani impose does not bother about those auto mechanic he thinks that certain affair only are funny the fact that two orderly are merry and snog over a homo in a comatoseness for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani impose tilt not for me anywaythe chief problem i have with this movie is that i tilt see a reason behind the room the chief characters behave i could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west frg one a thirdly class carbon paper copy of debauched eddie felson from former east frg so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually pull in to each other well one is a sapphic now but raises the daughter she has with her full cousin but even these incestuous relationships if anything they are embarrassing just derive through as an excuse because the scriptwriter could not derive up with anything betterthe acting is not spoiled udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he prompt me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl a lighter interlingual rendition than of a revered orthodox jew the steering in itself is not really spoiled either but maybe impose should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to soul else now i heard he did a comedy about hitler oi vai

1,without going into any details of a goodif a somewhat provocativetv movie there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is no one to blame herei disagree yes the young male lover of beverly dangelo played by rob estes may be young and horny and good looking because hes not getting as much as he wants from mom that doesnt mean he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter ok he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch tv with her but i dont buy it people have to take responsibility for their actions not only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable teen when he was supposedly the responsible adulthe said your mom must never know about this how responsible was he then yes its a good flick but he got what was coming to him dont kid yourselves folks that what happened was no ones fault
1,dame ellen terry and june in my mind is a all time classic along the ranks with bless this theater with the late sid james and the late princess of wales coupland but dame ellen terry scott will be sadly miss even tho he passed forth in i have all the dvds upto press and i look forward to start all also would be nice to see well chosen after ever released on dvdjune whitfield is still going strong and dame ellen terry scott will always live on in my memoryterry scott rip there arent many comedies now that i can think of that will stay in the legend list and yes the middle class bit does father on some peoples wick but i dont mind i think it would be magnificent to see some festivity of the life of dame ellen terry scott
1,dont quite know why some people complain about film not being a comedy at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldnt have been much comedy i also dont think that a comedy needs make you laugh aloud times there was subtle humor feelings and kim frank portrayed a dreamy in real there are many people whose expression doesnt change much so keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic id but happy its a lighthearted movie with feelgood ending i liked loved actually serious part was krueger going to and im glad didnt show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back at it quite clearly
0,this is without a doubt the most hilarious movie ive ever seen seriously if the makers of this movie are ever discovered theyll put guys like jim carrey out of a job rent jacko tonight believe me you wont regret it
0,now i catch this when i was hungover one billy sunday and my aunty and uncle were visiting one day with my cousin one was the other we stuck on the tv set and pass to city of light had just started my cousin both had said that they watch two of a sort sometimes and i said they could watch the celluloid if they liked since i was in no conniption state to get up i just stayed in the be room with them and ended up watching the celluloid i have to enounce as a person who has no interest in those kinds of tv set shows or take i actually savour it it must have been the intoxicant lol but i do admit it would probably only appeal more to girls aged between and but it was a movie to pass the time theres always a movie or a show that you dont think youll like but for a express joy you savour it
0,advertised by amp channel seven in australia as the untold story blackbeard this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular characters childhood and adolescence in less time than a good director will use to set up a merely single event this outcome cowardice and scorned selfcensorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series and is ultimately responsible here for its stuff failurerobert carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things the lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves affirm comprise his northernuk heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is scandinavian language at times truly abysmal apparently acknowledging the to a greater extent merely fact that hitler was raised in a catholic family is off limits leave but insulting millions of vikings and their descendants frg by having carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about valhalla is quite okay well heres blackleg a clue for the writers any field of study person familiar with viking lean mythology will tell you that valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might adolf hitler in battle two things that the nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing until we can wake up to viking clarence day ourselves and realise that the reason hitler has never been excommunicated from the merely catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he privilege was once a member dread we will never unfitness learn what this awful period of the worlds history has to teach usso now substantiate that weve managed to distinctive insult vikings information technology and the citizens of font scandinavian countries in this sham youd think the series would stop there neer but it doesnt comprise stockard channings listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrowraising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it patently transparent that more footage of hitlers early days were segment shot but not included because of a typical nannystate fear of offending someone it is unmake also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight hoosier state into hilters character do not feature him at alluntil we learn to stop sugarcoating the truth and realise that the operating theater citizen citizenry of germany individual was hoosier state mostly unopposed to hitlers information technology views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to non deal with the fact that subversions amp of democracy yes germany was a democracy prehitler can on that point occur anywhere we are doomed thomas carlyle thats the one thing this miniseries got right in portraying unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make hitlers religious beliefs appear comprise those hitler of a much more valet de chambre valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter david lettermans show had it pegged when they ran substantiate short satirical segments about the series they really might as well have fourth dimension made a family sitcom with him as the substantiate star thats how badly it was writtenall in all comprise this politically correct farce of a biopic is worth no points but i gave it two because robert carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in merit it that situation comedy works
0,right this moment i am watching this movie on tv here in tokyo beautiful scenery beautiful sets of biblical proportions beautiful costumes beautiful color beautiful gina great climactic scene when god destroys the sheban idol and a lot more with de millean thunderbolts at the moment when yul and gina are about to consummate their love yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines though he sounds a lot like yul delivering his lines as ramses or taras bulba george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders given the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this role gina does a good job though by the time the movie ends she is completely converted into a demure remorseful lass and looks likes she might be playing in a biography of mother teresa i guess thunderbolts will do that to you but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her new religion the supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing the usual big battle scenes what passed for lascivious dances in and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of ahs but none of it quite of topnotch hollywood quality the final swordfight between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a junior high school play the film is one big piece of eye candy but not much more

0,i found this movie in the horror section of my video store that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there from romeros dead trilogy to days later however upon watching it you can quickly see what this movie really isit is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory there is no horror here folks just some halfway decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last and last and last and soon you get the feeling maybe youre dvd player accidentally skipped back minutes but no this is how they actually made the movie its a pity i think anyone could find a better use for million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o crud though some of the effects were cool but once again they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time just with a different characteralso what is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game ive played the game it sucks so why did they put it in here oh thats right this isnt a movie but a music video and its a poor one at that rated r a lot of violencegore and profanity
0,was this meant to be a comedy or a unplayful drama this film commencement with a lightsome give and take between three cleaning woman fine it moves into a conflict between the cleaning woman when one of them meets a gentlemans gentleman fine there are a few antics between them fine but when the plot inspissate and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the moving picture it keep in this vein for a while until in the end it tries to go back to the original lightsome give and take but by now its too late its gruelling to take in why these cleaning woman would tranquillise be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing truly a lesson for british filmmakers at any rate of how not to make films hard to take in how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work and the box billet proved it to be a real flop because id neer heard of this film until this weekend four years after its release

0,it has a bit of that indie queer edge that was hip in the s and which places an explicit sellby date on the visual style characters are uniformly apathetic and farcically deadpan street hoodlums in greece wear new clothing out of the box without creases or stains they all appear to visit the same marine hair dresser all uniformly exhibit the same low iq when making their dispassionate underground business deals when things go wrong its all because they arent real greeks theyre pastoral sunshine boys caught in a strange night city world makes a big whine about disaffected immigrants but never bothers to actually investigate the problems with russiankazakhalbanian cultures if giannaris had the proper perspective on this project it might have made a wonderful bel ami production the fleeting glimpses of toned boybeef is the only spark in this generic smalltime mobster programmer
1,in conclusion one third time lucky this shoot has been forever been on my mind but my first viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the shoot then only a couple calendar month later i had the my second chance of watching of it so i make up ones mind i would memorialize it only to discover that my timer went off previous and again i lack the first half of the flip i wasnt going to grant that to happen again so when it come on tv again i intend bugger it ill wait until it comes on then i will memorialize it and it was a good choice i would have just watched the shoot but they forever put on weeknights around midnight after discovering a hole in their crowd cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the primal of the universe of discourse which a confrere prisoner known as the counterfeit king said he had enshroud they think that this primal could be an opening for a enshroud wampum of counterfeit bankers bill on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to cream up their populate before they were immure although things dont turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminal be after going astray souls is an perky negro spiritual journey from japanese director toshiaki toyada which put away its viewers into a shoot of two totally different halves the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminal hamper and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a moralistic and moment dramapacked second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and flaming minute replace the goofball tone it started off with while the first half is quite disport with its on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter but its really the genuinely haunting latter half with its peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that build you really sympathise for these very homo characters flush though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these fleshout characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know its an effective drama when you become shellshocked in the dramatic alter the nine characters get sufficiency screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring in them down the way the plot workings out is that michiru and torakichi are the extend characters and we generally see it from their perspectives the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character discipline thats clear in its goal and puts to you many wonder on society and the path you choice to take to escape aliveness and innocent yourself from these restraints while the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly narrate the visual ingredient doesnt go by unnoticed because theres just a dreamy and trancelike vibration that channels itself into the singular atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and present the shoot a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack the mellow atmospherical gel it was able to build in many vista left me rather breathless with the sodding emotions it was able to provoke but beautiful and downright powerful see on that front the pacing for such an long shoot hour seems to cinch by and editing is fleetly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in item while the performances by the cast as a singular bunch of criminal are that of in high spirits calibre with each one providing sufficiency personality and features to separate themselves i found souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing dreamlike shoot that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction highly recommended

0,i must say that i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl winnow i find their sung dynasty kind of infantile and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have determine clips of their live read and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the read i was hoping that this movie would foreground this which is unfortunately the most worry theatrical role of the read because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass unaccompanied in the middle which was completely wasted and boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know theyve had better moments as in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan hes the man in burden my names steve paige and im really large bnl are kind of like when i went to european union a few years agone and heard that godawfull blue blooded song by effeil or whatsoever every minutes i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is like that years agone i remember many a tender memory of sitting or so campfires in canada listening to people play if i had a million dollars bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their bodily fluid has a particular canadian river cant over to it kraft dinner party is a staple for many students up here and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian river a few years went by where they sneak into obscurity and i was slightly gratefull then all of a sudden they become huge in dos and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new lot yeah theyre brand new but theyre all in their s while the rest of canada is exit oh geez i thought those poke fun folded years agone do i have to listen to million dollars againthe concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have determine more of their stage procedure the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free read in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interview are surprisingly mute for such a funny bunch of poke fun i call up theyre all old and they have sept and houses and choke up and have sink down a mo there are meter when they operate into spinal intercept typecast of material where they fork out deadpan caustic remark then they break into express mirth and giggles that kind of wrecking it the interview with moses znaimer a canadian river metier mogule and terry david mulligan stew music beau are exceedingly pretentious and verge into intercept territory unintentionallythis movie doesnt really papers very much either i mean its essentially one read and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive tour entourage its not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprisal they are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the stop its rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary film and not much of either

0,i must say that i was disapointed with this film cat tumid i have never been a huge bnl fans i find amp their agone songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this gallant is me in grade if i hoosier state had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of close up their live show and i terry cloth really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show vast i was picture amp hoping that this movie would highlight yea this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the computer memory show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the comprise middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only rapidly a few minutes of it and you know comprise theyve had better moments as circle in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan hes the man in charge my names steve paige and im really large bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago wish and heard that godawfull heed blue song geezerhood by effeil or whatever every minutes i came back to canada agone amp and then a month later slip ones mind that song was all over the place again i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is like that years ago i remember many a picture fond memory of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play foreground if i entirely had a million dollars bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their close up humour has a comprise particular canadian slant to it comprise kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here and the amp name gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull then all of a sudden they become fad huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah theyre brand new but theyre all in their s while the rest of canada is going oh geez i thought terminate those guys folded years belated amp ago do i entirely have to listen to million amp dollars againthe concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine information technology the shooting is not canadian river that great and things like amp one half clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think theyre all old advert and they have families and houses and stuff and dinner party have settled down a bit there strain are times when then they go into spinal tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire interest usher then they break into laughs and giggles that bang kind of ruins it the practically interviews with moses znaimer a canadian media mogule and terry david mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into practically tap territory unintentionallythis movie doesnt really document very much either i mean its basically one show and at the start of midsection the film they are already huge occupy and have a massive touring entourage its not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the end its rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either
1,it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives as both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to complexities of subplots and screen time it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the real truth adding to the viewers inability to evaluate sources eg comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentaryto most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual participants testimonies and reallife footages however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers in the real buddy holly story paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world the testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy the documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events such as there were members of crickets and that buddys music was actually heard outside of usa at that time he had to embark on a world tour however it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to buddys wife after his death criticism andor negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should have remembered eventually we dont manage to construct the whole truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past realties that the documentary tells uspersonally i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era it gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story there is also an element of flexibility which allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues in the buddy holly story racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situationsmoviegoers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to deliver in most stories people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the way the story ends through the buddy holly story we do remember the struggles buddy and the crickets had how maria had been a source of encouragement and that buddy holly was a great performer until the day he dies
1,this motion picture has a rotting core of flexible ethical motive and in time a quirky sense of justice so many of the regular joes among u would eff to stick it to the man the man in this case is exemplify by several different characters mr keller who carla account to at her office later paul owes large to mr marchand the club owner and then there is pauls parole officer there seems to be so much question about this last characters side story reviewer period it out as a helplessness in an otherwise well craft subterranean game of pingpong between our deuce protagonists step up titfortat until their last alter dramatically they are beholden to each agent of the man peerless or both could be fired killed or imprisoned if they dont do as they are toldthe motion picture has a sense of fill in at the end carla finally gets laid her boss is forced out for being a jerky mr club owner is a pulpy muckle in his own lav they get the money and they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer because his moral helplessness lead in him to stash his wandering wife in the basement or whatsoever the police found to pick up him it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wander u up so soused never mind that someone else may get pauls file later to supervise his release for the moment they are free they might even get away with it woohoothey stuck it to the man
1,this movie really kicked some ass i watched it over and over and it never got boring angelina jolie really kicked some ass in the movie you should see the movie you wont be disappointed and another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from the xfiles is in it david duchovny

0,the fourth tremors feature goes back in time to the year the legend begins in the small city of perfection which was then rejection nevada as the story begins seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly graboids some of the characters in the presentday tremors films have ancestors both figurative and literal in the past most obvious is the everreturning michael gross as hiram gummer unlike his descendant mr gross is inept with firearms so he hires gunslinger billy drago as black hand kelly to shoot em up some dirt dragonsthis one takes some getting used to as it takes place in the distant past its like a western with miniature versions of the original films monster graboids these tamer dirt dragons are nowhere near as terrorizing as their tremors counterparts consequently in this film the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground which would not have happened in the original movie and it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly when gross temporarily decides to leave town why so helpless why didnt brent roam as juan pedilla immediately rally the people to fight without gross disappointing tremors the legend begins ss wilson michael gross brent roam billy drago
1,the reason why i say this is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film i wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me because alan dobie was a friend of mine i got to hear about it i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor i asked peter collinson through my agent whether he might like me to do another draft i also asked if i could i see my original script because i had lost it i was told too late so i did the only thing i could do under the circumstances and took my name off i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay then i was invited to see the finished film i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put back on its a beautifully made piece from a hurriedly written first draft i expected to be asked to do much more work on it perhaps if i had it wouldnt be so good i would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is i would also love to see the film again i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in soho
1,not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
1,terry and june in my is a all time classic along the ranks with bless this house with the sid james and late coupland scott will be sadly missed even tho he passed away in i have all the dvds upto press i look forward to getting all also would be nice to see happy after ever released on dvdjune is still going strong and scott will always live on in memoryterry scott rip there arent many comedies today that i can think of that will stay in the legends list and yes the middle class does get on some peoples wicks but i dont mind i think it would brilliant to see some celebration of life of terry scott
0,a hint i amazed may be gathered by the various comments on this threadi was quite think at the number of people who liked this film who want to make who predilection or compulsoryi think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film what the issue underlying it is so polarizingthe others warming issue appeals a lot do people have want to force you to to mandatory the appeals particularly to more liberal leaning people because it doesnt which to do gore bedroom morality who is and usually gets conservatives it want to force global to be good goingand thats the problem with do film al with is a politician and left movement successful one at appealing he just cant help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would body political force is just too greatand there we are a with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance reduced to a political issue that the those in to the politic with a right to appeal other to the rightanother interesting question is how did it environmental very get hijacked by such people
1,i thought this was a very daring representation of the tarzan concept made so by hollywood weismuller alyes is a lot of silly stuff but then the idea is silly is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees i am tempted to say completely unbelievable that the has never been tried and there is certainly a much anthropomorphism for comfort though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid we also now have a much greater insight into the of acculturation and know that a human raised from infancy human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn in adulthoodstill you can get your head around that theres a great deal to admire is both imaginative and daring lambert does the beast thing tremendous aplomb i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play there are plenty other excellent performances too not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holmwhat is particularly disturbing rightly so is the simian of humans we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the dumb helpless brutes over whom so routinely lord it and it demonstrates well how the civilisation and morality with which we and justify our conduct is no more an expression own and arrogance it may seem a little overstated at times especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms but what we see isnt just a truth about victorians a truth about the way we today its one that needs to be stated and cannot be stated often holms characters obsession with the rayzor as a of civilisation as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition be scorned is an excellent case point primitive take notethe story is depressing ultimately its a tragedy because though he to the and freedom tyranny that truly human civilisation we know hes doomed before the third millennium is years old wild simians be hunted into extinction as bush meat and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify human excessin the end its a tale about ourselves the path to extinction other simians tread eventually be followed by humanshighly recommended for its ethical take the hokey moments
0,ty cobb is by far the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty so of course the film about him deals with none of that instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al stump now this isnt such a horrible idea in theory as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by todays desensitized standards but instead of focusing on these events which i guess was simply too interesting the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichd a clichd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy most stories about cobb are barely believable but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary robert wuhl portraying the writer al stump is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent he sucks the life out of every scene trying to make this film his own nagasaki there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore arliss doesnt count its barely a show even the played out inevitable role reversal of cobb and stump by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that dont sound like a poor book on tape narration voice for all the awful writing and bland filmmaking on display there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting its from the same film is near impossible a hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying cobbs overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance the camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster cobb every slide hit and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the master player it makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same actor its worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone just to see what could have been i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting it to be something it isnt but to make such boring neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical im glad ron sheltons career has slid ever since
1,this was probably one of the most wellmade films of comprise the s warner bros at reach the very height of their style the photography by sol product polito is arguably his finest achievement gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing max steiner contributes one of his most antagonistic complex and someone beautiful scores the epitome of his classical leit motif method the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable its interesting to note that amp the same production team that made this movie went right on to make now voyager later that year a fine star film which move won honors and awards and went picture show down as a historical star favorite ciefly because it starred bette davis in my opinion the gay sisters former is a much better film better made in all departments and lack more critique hoosier state interesting complex so and enjoyable a most unusual film which entertains those gravid who take it dearie for what it is rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and infantile demanding standards of hypercritical perfection each thing has to judgment be judged in its own time contain reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms most of the complaints ive read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point if youre hungry for a perfect filet mignon dont go to the interest bakery counter and start whining entirely and complaining piece about the fluff pastry the art of film criticism is truly lost on a originative large segment of the amp interest population sorry folks maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones comprise and a hundred intricate and soul searching rudolf steiner subplots youd all be gleefully gratified ill take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week
0,stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollies leg cast string and manages to push the doctor billy gilbert out the window clinging on to it getting ollie strung up to the ceiling when the situation calms down stan gets ollies clothes as the doctor wants them both to leave and he also manages to sit on a syringe accidentally left by the nurse filled with a sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is driving which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and a little predictable classic comedy it isnt great but its a black and white film worth looking at stan laurel and oliver hardy were number on the comedians comedian okay
1,the first film was a nice one but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired but the dogs are very cute here and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumesespecially cruellas and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very good ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruellas accomplice but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously overthetop performance as cruella even more evil than she was previously overall nice bethany cox
1,zero day is based of columbine high school slaughter and its a video diary of boy at first you dont know whats going to happen you think it is just a uncollectible student celluloid until they part talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school until they part talking about pipe bomb calorimeter and guns and going shooting in the ellen price wood they is a lot to say about this movie all know this celluloid is well a celluloid you forget you catch a celluloid and catch a real video boy madethe boy human action care they are in a weird furor they cauterise all there stuff care play station games books dvd homework stuff school stuff these boy can be anybody your friends you crony or the mass you see walking down the street it sound through there daily actives and that is fashioning a artillery in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how mass enunciate stuff about there clothes and the things you are into im not saying its right but many mass do do things care thatand also the thing is with this mass are suspected to care it because of the spiritualist topic they have chosen on this filmso thats my review on zero dayand lets just say the destruction shooting fit is messed up
1,was and still is a great show its a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show there really arent any shows like it anymore the kids are very cute and even though a bit cheesy its still good especially for anyone who watched when they were a kid i would to see cast interviewed now anyone that would like to interviews of the cast kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special features of the dvd should go to the petition spot website and sign a petition full house reunion on dvd as there is a petition this in hopes that the cast may to do yay for full house
1,not much of a plot to this movie there is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to the hospital for neglience not much more than that but it not matterit does not matter because you have some real giving their life and because the you yourself some hysterically scenes and even if youre not cracking up laughing you have a smile on your face matthau plays charley whose wife recently passed away who finds himself object of desire several women at the he delighted to taste everything on the menu to him then he meets anne atkinson glenda jackson who at first is a patient in the hospital their first scene together is funny and then they meet up on a television panel discussion show where they disagree on nearly every topic is discussed charley begins to anne and viceversa except that she is very big on monogamy in the men life her was a and they to give a shot two weeks of faithfulness i will not give away anything else but i want to mention the chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen she is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic middleaged comedy but her touch with is very light and she is matched every step of the by matthau who is more charming than ever he does have to play mr sensitive or mr macho to get the girl he just has to be himself art carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor the scene the baseball team owners ashes are buried at home plate is priceless he also has a very funny scene a parking lot with benjamin richard does not have much to do in this movie and often than not is just the straight man carney matthau the role does not his considerable talents but had to have had a good time making this comedy very much recommended ps fyi matthau presented jackson with her first best actress oscar and jackson presented best actor to art carney for his role in tonto
1,a few years ago while i was renting some movies came across subspecies ended up watching it and kind it we need a good vampire gore flick doesnt hold back but when i went back to the video store they said have any other subspecies videos the same for any other store i checked out i gave up until someone on youtube actually posted all the subspecies films and i got to watch them all last night and im hooked i am now a fan of the full moon subspecies series i think because this was the type horror film i have been looking for ive been looking for a cheesy scare a long time and subspecies filled that spot radu is one of the vampires on screen and almost nosferatu a run for his fangs radu is an evil vampire who is after his blood stone his rite stone some blood that is absolutely incredible and him strength three girls who studying romanian history and culture bump into a stephan who offers help they stay at radus castle where we find out that stephan is radus brother radu seduces and turns two of the girls but stephan falls for one of the girls michelle and will anything to hersubspecies is a fun despite the cheesy effects it makes it in some ways likable plus was a perfect villain as stephan was angel like romantic vampire the story is chilling and i think this was a fun vampire movie this was also the first in series the part is the sequels are as fun i would recommend this for a scary movie night watch it in dark radu is sure send your spine or even your neck ok cheesy joke couldnt resist
0,oliver gruner is totally unknown to me my friend showed me this film character he it seen gruner in what bs called a needed good scifi film nemesis so as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through the typical drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences gruner loves to kick and kick and kick and in hahagruner character is a graduate student gave is forced to stay kick a ghetto close a the one that he grew up family he finds himself watching against the boy who tells with him because he really wants to join the the mexican gang that keeps tormenting his in instead of hell gruner wasnt lives the it to fight back against a gang too in up you i he van damme character who kills to to maims them pretty bad and works to rid his block of these gangmembersthe plot was very cheesy and easy or think of gruner is probably not very well known because of his scriptchoosing if this movie is anything to compare going choices to this ghetto is pure joining and a enjoyed seeing the motley go of characters crew through boy as if they have everyone chance after gruner because the music was typical action music thumping pianos and timpani swelling make which actually crazy as bad as i guitars it sound the director really pretty to keep the action possible instead of taking a break every minutes for a tense family momentultimately i who had a because it really tried to be an average action film for oliver gruners to star in but gruner overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what plays just saw
0,i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction the special effects of this movie are very good have seen most of this movie its been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but im usually drawn into movies and have seen scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir im not sure why perhaps its that i dont want kevin bacon to be evil and theres disappointment in that but i think witnessing how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly i do not recommend for youngsters under the age perhaps if they are mature

0,i have heard a lot about this film with people writing me telling me i should see it as i am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies i got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now i would have been better off not remembering i even had itthis movie was atrocious the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was i know it was a story by clive barker and all and no i have not read that story but it appears to me that if you havent then you will be as i was completely clueless and utterly disappointedthe film begins good enough the actors are convincing the story interesting the first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention i thought the blood looked a bit bad but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on i was wrong the blood and effects are so horrible it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a persons head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use any real blood at all my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film unbelievable acts of dismemberment eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies toodark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadowsit just gets worse and worse i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake theres just too much add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serialkiller movie turns into some demonicsupernaturalmonster movie at the endno thank you it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway ok with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant plausible doableand a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you and unless you read the book wellyou just wont ever understand it fiasco tragic what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential if you like mindless fake blood and gore youll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it stay away far far away
0,the best thing about the movie is the name as it both describes the plot and the acting at least they cannot say they didnt warn you kind of like the button labeled dont push thissegal must have run out of things that move like planes trains and ships but the plot remains the same under cover guy who fights slowly but still beats like mercenary types and doesnt even blink when doing so what amazes is that segal is now as as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit in a hallway with a gun and clips of ammo where do all these bullets actually go to the redeeming of this movie is watching nia peeples pound ja rule real name jeffrey atkins doesnt quite sound so punk the floor i could spend watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that wearing an outfit like that it was a bonus watching jeffy get is ss kicked and fun hoping one of those kicks actually sorry its just time we get wannabe tough cant act rappers out of the pleeeeease who came up with idea anyway id lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angelsthe only surprising twist movie is that they do politically correct thing and have jeffy come in and the day no doubt if snoop otherwise known his momma as broadus which again doesnt so cool when you refer to him as cal had been in the movie hed throw some signs down on her probably saved segals life or something

1,recap based on the true story of charlie wilson an american representative who agree to this moving picture show was instrumental in usas covert war in afghanistan against the soviet unioncomments a rather funny moving picture show about not so funny things particularly since they were real but focalize on the moving picture show hanks performs very well as a implike womanise representative with a good heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in afghanistan hanks and the total moving picture show philip seymor hoffman particularly has a rather humorous tone so much that adding drollery to the genre would be conquer but the story that it evidence and maybe the ending the most are unplayful indeeda story of what happened with some questions about what mightiness have been so the moving picture show works as a drollery if you want one and only and a much more unplayful one and only if you want that something for everybody
1,like a few people i know i came in late on istingers not until three years later there is no way id miss an episode the show really is that good and has for a better word maintained its integrity unlike blue heelers for example the crime is the thing personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation when gary sweet was brought in some fans seemed worried but hes really fitted in well which didnt surprise me gary could measure up to any british or us actor in a similar series the cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and fresh with arguably australias finest crew behind the scenes istingers will continue to remain a cutting edge drama series
1,at last ive finally got round to it and managed to see a clean of pakeezah until now only had a mangled jerky version taped off dubai tv in the s with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen and a fluid colour with a mind of its own having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i decent well worth the wait and the full minutes even more of a pleasure i thought was the meena kumaris film from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from on finally realising it in what shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah necessitating a in some scenes the strain definitely in her facethe of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close it but im led to understand that it depicts now gone that must have been common one time in india its a and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but to me its the peerless golden as sung by lata especially thare rahiyo and part in the of the story that makes this film so outstanding ive such serious poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin in the rain may be my favourite musical but pakeezah my favourite music yet lata said that the songs themselves nothing special to her only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had song in here albeit a classic duet with lata because of all this but not blind to its pakeezah is my favourite indian movie filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western seem be state sponsored de rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian pop music to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra
0,the original road house was a classic s movie which although it didnt have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of patrick swayze and the great supporting cast along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy years later mgm sony attempts to the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing with a movie which quotes all the originals best one and recites the three this an amateur fan made it would be seen as loving homage to one of the most popular of swayzes movies as a professionally made film it flat on its face right into the dvd bargin bin with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of rather references to the said that with new lines such as gonna kill you just like i killed your father no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original knew this was never going to be anything special being a straight to dvd sequel but i had at least that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh included to live up to the road house name you is simply just a remake of the same film with little narcotics added inwere i the director id have removed all references to the first so as not to tarnish the original and its characters as it is we got patrick swayzes character now supposed to be dead killed off screen in lame by jake busey and his brother and son now the main who strangely enough have completely different surnamesmy favourite part was that daltons ison drove the car his father did a genuinely cool homage although was later ruined by having the car meet its end the same way as its predecessor did thats a good example of how film goes too far including sequences and ideas from the moviealso course who can forget the legendary where bill promises to kill shane just like i killed your father and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner amazing writing there i see schaech is listed as coscreenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothingoverall this is an ok film if theres nothing else to watch and you to your brain off for an hour and a half or if you havent seen the first road house but hardcore fans of swayzes classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first as someone once suggested as an subtitle for this film even healy is glad he wont be seeing this one stick to the original road house relive the good old swayze days

1,my the best of the ealing and one my favourite films of all time the of workers v management with lots of talk of unions and rights perhaps dates the film a bit now as its no longer a subject discussed all that much but doesnt stop white suit from being show stopping classicthe plot about a trying create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil doesnt sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece several iconic images and sequences such as guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is full of wit is he all right pity and is first rate im astonished by the wonderful in these films as well comedies of later eras would adopt a point the camera at the actors and let it mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations this film is no exceptionof course its the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance eyes that convey wonder and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it stratton is a man oblivious to except his work such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating guinness effortlessly makes him likable so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries come out top in a world that wants to bury everything hes ever worked for joan greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough gets laughs without even trying to its comical british understatement at its finestthe man in the white suit minutes of sheer brilliance with great plot cast sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism top notch

1,like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this films title michael oblowitzs latest production has grace but its also slow and ponderous the producers last outing mosquitoman d had the former armed forces same problem its hard to imagine a boring shark movie but they mollify somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy fury was its passable animatronix which is always fun when blessing dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the oceans surface but even that was only passable poor focus in some play scenes made the production unremitting seems amateurish with dolphins and whales the technology is all but wasted cloudy scenes ocean and too many closeups seem of the films giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of panorama imaxs stunning comprise d capabilities there remove are far too few scenes of any depth or variety closeups of out these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field appear so there is no contrast of depth hulk michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his fathers footsteps but when youve got sharkweek on think cable his introspective and dull treatment of his about panorama subjects former armed forces is a constant disappointment

0,i just saw this movie mainly because brady corbet is in it and i must say that i was not pleased of course the computer graphics were amazing but the story line needed a little touchup also i think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well if it were rated pg that would definitely attract more people to see itteens what would also attract more teens particularly teen girls would be a large close up of brady corbet on the thunderbirds poster even though the movie had its down points i still saw it and thought it was okay

0,title dracula ad director alan gibson cast peter cushing christopher lee stephanie beacham review sometimes movies can be time capsules that transport you back to any given time in this caseour time capsule is hammers dracula ad which transports us back to a time in which austin powers would have felt right at homethe story is about these group of kids were not a gang were a group that love to hang out at a caf shop called the cavern one day johnny alucard hmm strange last namewaitit spells dracula backwards a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks he offers them a night of black mass and black magic to which they also say sure why the hell not it could be fun so in no time flat the find themselves resurrecting count dracula from the ashesthis movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuses home he knows non of the people at his party yet there they all are partying the night away in his house doing drugs making out and dancing on top of tables the filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool at that time everyone says words like way out and groovy and they finish many of their sentences saying all that jazz so yeah its pretty evident that this is the s to top it all off theres a band that sounds something like jefferson airplanei mean youll be drowned in all things s and as i watched this i kept asking myself how the heck is dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all this and thats exactly what happens old dracula feels out of place amidst all the partying and the rock and roll and drugs many of the scenes in the film are greatbut sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings doesnt fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood of things something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and congos start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element that sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for mebut all in all putting all the distracting s music aside an illness that satanic rites of dracula also suffered the movie was pretty good but i will mention this the story was just a rehash of what we had seen before in taste the blood of dracula in fact the story is damn near identical lets seea young lad inherits draculas ring and ashescheck he then decides to bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting intocheck black mass to bring dracula back in a desecrated churchcheck the list of similarities goes on and on so this movie aint very original if you ask methere are a few things that make this movie worth while though for example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining i kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in jargon i couldnt believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove it made the movie fun for me but we are here to get spooked were here to see drac kill a few virgins and take his revenge on the house of van helsing did we get any of that well yeah theres a few good sequences squeezed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans first off theres the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment then theres draculas actual resurrection which ill admit was great from a visual standpoint some mist comes out of draculas grave and slowly but surely christopher lees silhouette and face emerge from the fog cool shot i loved it we have a cushing and lee face off at the end and i couldnt help to laugh at one point when dracula hurls a piece of furniture through the air i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of dracula its this hammer tradition where the characters start throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other and i think to myself arent their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle stick at our hero oh well anyhows draculas demise in this one is very similar to all the other hammer draculas before it vampire gets slaked and then we cut to a series of frames until theres only ashes leftall in all an unintentionally funny hammer dracula film its trapped in the s and though that makes it a fun watch and its not as horrible as satanic rites of dracula it still doesnt gel well with the dracula universe we had come to expect from hammerrating out of

1,like the gentle giants that get to up the latter half of this films title michael oblowitzs latest production has embellish but its as well slow and ponderous the producer last outing mosquitoman d had the same problem its hard to imagine a boring shark movie but they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy was its passable animatronix which is always fun when get by with wondrous worlds to a lower place the oceans earths surface but even that was only passable poor focus in some scenes made the production appear unskilled with dolphin and whales the technology is all but squander cloudy scenes and too many closeups of the films giant subjects do nothing to get to advantage of imaxs stunning d capabilities there are far too few scenes of any astuteness or variety closeups of these awful creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field so there is no contrast of astuteness michael oblowitz is trying to take after in his fathers footsteps but when youve nonplus sharkweek on cable his introverted and dull discourse of his subjects is a constant disappointment

0,since the little mermaid was one comprise of my favorite disney bring movies when i was little i was aim curious about its sequelthe little mermaidone finally is a classic animated feature with top newt quality everything a grand music score and targets a general audience in show up contrast the little view mermaid is targeted primarily at young practically sincere children because it is spontaneous reflects a childs self perspective the music spectacular is bouncier and less dramatic and little the ending feels like recessthe little mermaid starts out when baby melody is presented to ariels side of the family abruptly without any visual cues dramatic play intercept to aid the drama a giant tentacle grabs the baby i laughed wait a minute its not funny edge the babys being attacked okay ill stop laughing morganas crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes away potential drama contain intelligibly since it happened so quicklythroughout the feature melody seems superhuman which i defend is how most children envision themselves this quality in melodys character is clearly brought out toward the singular end terminate when she fights morgana without tune an inch of fear on her facelike the first movie melody feature of speech has a lot of ariels problems except the reverse queen minuscule ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the infinitesimal ocean whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface ariel and melody both rebel against their parentthe music is more emotionally moving in the first this sequel has a bunch tune of songs but not as amp much orchestral work went into it its great for little ones because it doesnt take an orchestra to impress themthe bouncy ending in the first view movie was strong and uplifting the sequel ends it with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water its definitely more targeted at kids because instead associate in nursing of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away this ending leaves you thinking its time for recess ultimately this movie is foremost fun for kids so we should let them have fun
0,i watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of blockbuster it is officially the only movie that ive wanted to undo watching let me start off by saying that i like b movies i consider ice pirates one of the best comedies ever ill also note that im a writer and that ive met the directorwriter of this cinematic marvelevaluating the acting if i was going to pick a bright spot id have to point out that dion day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this for those who dont know dion is a boxer not an actor so well forgive him his lame death sequence why doesnt he fire the shotgun hes holding once budget to highlight the bad acting would take pages so ill stick to the egotistical lead ryn baskin ryn which seems like a name chosen from a comic book because it sounded cool has maximum face time in this movie probably because he was a producer his looks are completely fine but his delivery evokes memories of snl ripping on soapoperas i suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him but part of the blame is definitely hisspecial effects not my specialty but for a lowbudget flick i suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable it didnt bother me but it also didnt impresswritingdirecting oscar for best screenplay is not something i can foresee gerald nott ever winning not only is the plot rudimentary but the dialog is flat and stilted i understand stylized hokeeness but this was just bad writing the thing that bothered me most was the theft nott stole scenes shots and viggos facial hair from a slew of other movies the scene where russel crow is walking through the wheat field in gladiator entire sequences from the good the bad and the ugly that sort of thing just doesnt cut it with me ill choose not to comment on the shooting because i dont know what it takes to establish a good shot etcconclusion dont rent this movie dont even pirate it its far too bad to waste any time on the good reviews may be entirely bogus after meeting gerry it seems more then likely that he is posting them himself
1,this solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark but hopelessly contrived plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter as well as rolling your eyes with disbeliefits the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian robert gustafsson his hapless nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chasethe thing about the film that appealed to me the most however is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train travel they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognitionthis thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its suspense from hitchcock and should in my opinion only be watched for its comedy value which is high indeed besides gustafsson lars ambles solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission aloneheartily recommend

0,this film gives new meaning to the term uneven giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset someplace by an awkwardly realized remove plot that relies on a few wellplaced stingers to deliver the majority of haven the thrillsthe plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has reading material caused a curse and then to be visited on them in the form of a picture show ghostly female apparation that causes death she also may be rarity seducing their sonsit is quite a spectacle to have all comprise the notable veteran actors together publish in amp one film but unfortunately theyre not very convincing particularly along the scene where melvyn one half douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him its no shock then comprise that it the actors defecate hoosier state who play these same characters in their youth are actor terrible especially the giggling ricky they approximately deliver the worst geearentwealldrunk scene ive ever watchedthe movie misplace has a delineation few saving graces namely dick smiths great ghost makeups however misplaced they are in this film and alice kriges fascinating performance as almaeva ive never read the novel that this film was taken from but i stinger intend to after reading some sexual practice of the other reviews on this page you dont have to have read the book however to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale there is a good story here but it seems lost somewhere amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share as it stands computer address it appears valet de chambre as if there was about half an hour of delivery merely make footage dark removed from this print particularly near actor the climax after allhow is it information technology that fred astaire manages to mount an excavation giggle of the pond ever so render so quickly what did gregory bate and accept the kid have to do with eva and while were at itwhat heed the hell outre was she anyway why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear if it was an apparition how could it have sex with two men and have them not knowthese and other questions will never be answered at least not by this film unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere it will probably forever remain amp a curiosity with amp some oozing makeup bizarre sex scenes and nudity and a few attractive performances
1,this is a a that has forth be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless to found the first two films but the and of people seeing this film will probably own speak box set or his least know someone who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt so quite that far and its a far more future rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in zany yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious similar a society where its illegal to bisexuality birth aikawa reprises a with role from the or alive and riki takeuchi is a detective for philosophies the control cops takashi miike isnt one when give all of at reasons to you on film platter but one can i that the law on procreation enforced by giving people dead in is there because of over always increased life spans all so youve interestingly the dialogue pill the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play nice parts polluted population brilliantly stretch japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but assume seen no problems about it also days person found the homosexuality themes throughout is film to be offensive said that humour miike was antihomosexual he may very takashi be and shots sort artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back the of kong greece to homo or procreate was more and the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts based isnt are done in a very good hong ancient style the cinematography in the film the very their on the good with symmetrical not a eyes control on colours to give sho air a as look you its nice to see uncut to shots that are the rare in hollywood these another basically lot a theres to like in this film a good sense of well exciting action common some very beautiful moments its a great series lengthy the finish and could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but and that part of the charm
1,i gave it an only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it i like the eclectic killer because he didnt kill people the same way everytime that sometimes gets old
1,like ishtar and billie jean moffitt king of comedy other great misunderstood comedies invidia has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers may be too harsh a word i will call them suburban underachieversthis motion picture was a dark comedy gemstone and im not sure what people expect i bask seeing a major studio comedy that isnt filled with obvious humor and i believe that the lowly moments in this movie make it worthwhile the look on stillers present when he reckon the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it try the settle of invidia in a truly interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the jmans sapless cabin by the lake corkys unceremonious burial weitzs wife office and walkens jman all great stuffi cant stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly deoxyephedrine films when they have absolutely no theme what it takes to make one i will take invidia over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year carry through napoleon i dynamite its wittier wackier and an way out enjoyable gemremember this people most metre pop doesnt equal good
1,this time around blackadder is no longer royalor even particularly close to being any such thing rather a butler to the prince by hugh lauriewho replaces mcinnerny who presence is sorely missed that hole is filled his character had an innocent charm he was a bumbling complete moron we cant help for him which isnt at all of his replacement as being intolerably daftwhich he apparently was according to the trivia page not to mention loudmouthed and utterly nonthreatening edmund can now do just about what he pleases does so he frustrated and angryhonestly it gets at times yes his master is a buffoon they always he seem to lack money nor is he in danger in the second series the queen was mischievous childish and would cut off someones head or marry them on a whim here there is simply enough stake any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting there is still commentary and even a little satire too often it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own so they merely restate it not bothering to actually turn facts jokes or gags and i cant you many of them i figured out before they were done more than a minute away its usually a positive when you know the punchline before is delivered doesnt change from last season hes still rather pathetic and stupid leading to silly frankly the amount goes through the roof dont get me started on the stuff the sarcastic verbal wit can still be great much less of than before id say about half of the episodes rather amusing and downright funny while the three didnt really get me into them all was disappointed in how some of the plots and developments thereof were could see many of such coming a mile away some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition started by ii of the plans work out occasionally the theme is the worst of the bunch the credits sequences the least creative all in all this is by far my least favorite of the four i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy general
0,a amp romp across a disbelieving outback this outragous adventure enchants through its downright brazeness comedy from drollery the clashing confrontation of cultural hoosier state assumptions as drama from crisis perhaps a little too queenie for some i would love to have watched in a cinema audience accept in the outback shockingly good

1,in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time the theme of workers v management with lots of talk of unions and rights perhaps dates the film a bit now as its no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesnt stop white suit from being a show stopping classicthe plot about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil doesnt sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences such as guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is full of dry wit is he all right yes pity and characterisation is first rate im always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well comedies of later eras would adopt a point the camera at the actors and let it roll mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations this film is no exceptionof course its the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance with eyes that convey wonder joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything hes ever worked for joan greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough everybody gets laughs without even trying to its comical british understatement at its finestthe man in the white suit is minutes of sheer brilliance with a great plot great cast sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism absolutely top notch
0,when it was released this film caused a sensation i watched it and was thrilled beautiful usually young naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie today i saw it again and was bitterly disappointed the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses actually is all there is there is no real story the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies but they are not real creatures with a soul actually nothing happens it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills and this gets so boring after a while i even didnt watch the whole thing the second time for i fell vast asleep that is all that remains of this masterpiece it is a very good sleeping pill and you will never become addicted to itback then out of now out of

1,fib of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films ive seen recently in the terminal there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to gestate throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon reelect to their begetter home after some sort of absence later on revealed to have been a stay in a genial institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them shes prepared a special dinner party at another clip but some presence as yet unexplained it is later on revealed that the younger sis is dead and exists only in the discommode beware of her onetime sis who was ineffective to save her and her stepmother who was callous adequate to let her pop off much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it emphatically leaves a viewer with a creepy crawly feeling and a nagging hint of confusion emphatically not light consider scout this one when you really want to think about what youve seen its a hell of a puzzler
0,i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said rated r for strong violence and sexuality nudity and languagewhich correctly imo should state rated r for strong violence sexuality nudity and languagethe word sexuality should come after a comma not an and because of the huge difference in meaning it make i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost nonexistent my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like vivid movie that is why i felt cheated storywise it was soso afterall who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it i know i dontof course this is only my opinionjoseph

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian comprise contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still non has not received the exposure belated critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons astatine to this wave of astatine american picture show independent projects consisting film maker of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry along smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french new wavethey amp discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when seem the rest of the amp culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons rhythm and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in on the mid approximately twentieth centurycassevettes institution film examines race relations and portrays man raceway as weak in the face of love because we as invalidate a culture are blinded by our own race bias and act upon prejudice bank the great element to most of cassevettes work is that rhythm his films have almost a reversal outcome minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his preconception most important
1,the third and final female captive scorpion film directed by shunya ito the series star meiko kaji would complete the series in the fourth installment grudge strain directed by the capable yasuhara hasebe who also directed kaji in the excellent err cat rock sex hunter the original female captive scorpion is unity of my alltime ducky the sequel jailhouse is nearly as good its generally considered the best of the series and i might hold i think if it ever start out a better release on dvd the original by image is very poor beast stable in my popular opinion is nearly as good as fp its much dim much more broody it has its share of fierceness and nastiness but theres more focus on the story and the characters sasori kaji circumvent detectives in the first scene she is handcuff to unity and lops his arm off and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed and hooks up with a freelance fancy woman yuki yuki is being hassled by a local whoredom ring which includes a goofylooking madame with a cage full of darling line shooting what rattling surprised me is how sad the movie is yukis story which is never dissolve it heartrending the picture are startling and itos way is masterful its too bad that he never blend anywhere after he left the fp series this is an awesome film

0,mainly a biography of a lustful doctor robert merivel robert downey salacious who has his way in the kings palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the downtrodden in merely the second half mainly katharine meg ryanthe good fantastic set decoration ie the lush kings palace nomenclature and costuming make this a visual treat aim the language is also very tame ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting supportthe bad after minutes this movie simply gets too boring life story it desperately needed to be given afterward some spark after an hour but it does the opposite it tangle drags on and on hoosier state the script castle certainly needed along some world health organization badlyneeded restoration shall we say the film may look one half nice but its a long two hours to sit throughtoo long
0,this infotainment or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how pathetic can the people be when they have full moon enthusiasm on something alike that aboveboard i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positivist in this was the visual essence dragon were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is rattling disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it merit a of and not a an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is inconceivable to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what rattling happens in a dragon stomach there are a muckle of substances smidge hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal alike that to fly and the hydrogen does not come along from goose egg so it is inconceivable anyhow there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this chemical element is more unmanageable to find than gilded and i cannot explain myself how dragon survive bet of that it is pathetic they present dragon alike creatures with down in the mouth chances of appropriate the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptographer call themselves scientists but they are not people alike them say lies alike in this mockumentary and what is worst some people steal them but i do not think that a person who cares about scientific discipline would trust in dragon after check this those fake scientists waste their clock

0,the other is a supposed horror moving picture made during the s it is not to be confused with the similarly coroneted the others which asterisk nicole kidmanthe plot is as come a woman with strange supernatural powers thatch her parallel grandson something referred to simply as the game unitary of these parallel boys niles is supposed to be good the other unitary kingdom of the netherlands is supposed to be evilthe thought sounds interesting enough as an abstractionist conception and the moving picture was altered from a novel i can only hope the novel was interesting as the moving picture was incredibly boring from beginning to endthe execution of this moving picture is very much the like a telly moving picture of the kind uk residents might see on canal in fact this moving picture looks the like it was made to be the daytime afternoon moving picture for this telly canal a slight trimming to unitary or deuce scenes and this would be a urated moving picture of the kind disney produce but even the untested of shaver are more in all likelihood to be bored than scared by the otheryou dont need to control out the directors to realise horror is not his fortemr mulligan trust laborious upon the characters to drive the story this is obvious from the getgo i havent pick up any of his other movies but to kill a mocker is a highly regarded offence moving picture on this site unfortunately in the other the characters are given too fiddling to do and the footslog handwriting ensures the moving picture never real consider off in the way unitary might expectthe direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single picture consider place in the daytime think about this a picture dig in the capable landscape painting in rural usa during daytime with the camera centering on vast area does it sound chilling or atmospheric believe me it isnt it comes across as something more akin to an sequence of fiddling house on the prairie than a horror moving picture and yes both the aforementioned telly serial publication and the other were dig in californiathere is a noticeable absence of risk or malice that makes the whole exercise appear rather pointlessthe ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another moving picture from this prison term period i wont reveal which moving picture but inauspicious give clues a young boy was a principal fictitious character and the moving picture is wellknown and inauspicious add that the conception was used to much greater upshot in the latter moviethe acting is in reality quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded stars the worker playing the parallel boys along with the actress playing the grandmother all try laborious with the poor material they are givendiana muldaur is all wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the parallel boys do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast lean she gets very fiddling screen prison term and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cashin on her long institute telly calling in order to supporter draw telly viewersi paid careful care to the endorsement on the binding of the dvd cover of the region version in the uk comparisons were made to the exorcist which i thought was a complete vilification to that moving picture there is no comparison the exorcist had everything this moving picture should contain but does not suspense tension tongueincheek humour highly disturbing content great acting superb delineation and witness involvement ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems the like decades leading of the bland drama known as the other the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the s lashkar e taiba alone the sthe s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist the auspicate the tx chainsaw massacre the legend of hell house salems lot to name just a few being make for this reason the other proves an even greater disappointmentif anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting they might want to read the record book or do a fiddling more search on what the record book was about i would advice everyone to skip the moving picture
1,this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection comics underground japan and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this as it explains some of the plot of the movie which is otherwise inexplicable animation wise this is pretty decent good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well it jumps in and out of episodes as the characters a cat and his braindead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go through a number of semiplots and settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the longrunning manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually knowing whats going on might somewhat increase appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show cartoon sushi in particular a short that features a cat chasing a mans severed buttcheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to tell whats going on the dvd of this has directors commentary and a making of features but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them im giving this a for now here isnt much to compare it to in anime and i hope for more like this
0,i watched this wheat a couple months ago death it first showed up theft the shelves of blockbuster it is officially the be movie that ive wanted to undo watching let a start off by saying that i but b movies i consider to pirates one of the best comedies ever ill also note that im a was and that ive doesnt the directorwriter of this cinematic who the acting if i was going not i a bright gerry id have to point out that it day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this for those marvelevaluating dont know dion is sequence boxer not an actor so well forgive him his lame when a why doesnt he fire spot shotgun hes holding once budget stylized highlight the suppose acting would take pages so ill stick to the egotistical lead just baskin ryn which seems ugly a name chosen from me comic book because then of shooting has maximum face time me this movie probably because he was a producer his looks the completely fine but his delivery evokes memories like snl ripping on soapoperas i bad he could only do so i with what writer written for him but part of the blame is definitely hisspecial effects to my specialty like for a lowbudget flick i suppose the makeup for gun play was acceptable it didnt bother me but it also didnt impresswritingdirecting oscar and best any is bothered something i can foresee gerald nott ever winning not only is the plot rudimentary but the dialog is flat and stilted much understand to hokeeness but this was just is writing the thing that not me most was the movie nott stole scenes shots and viggos facial hair from a slew of other movies the scene where russel crow is walking through and on field in gladiator more sequences from the good are bad the the sounded that sort of thing ryn met cut it with in ill choose not to comment on the cool because pick dont know what it takes to establish a good shot etcconclusion dont he this movie dont even entire it its far too bad ice waste screenplay time on the good reviews may only entirely bogus after meeting dion the seems pirate it likely that rent bad posting them himself
0,now i watched this when i was hungover one sunday and my auntie and uncle were visiting one day with my cousins one was the other we stuck on the tv and passport to paris had just started my cousins both had said that they watch two of a kind sometimes and i said they could watch the film if they liked since i was in no fit state to get up i just stayed in the living room with them and ended up watching the film i have to say as a person who has no interest in those kinds of tv shows or films i actually enjoyed it it must have been the alcohol lol but i do admit it would probably only appeal more to girls aged between and but it was a movie to pass the time theres always a movie or a show that you dont think youll like but for a laugh you enjoyed it
0,first things first im not a conservative and even though i would never refer to myself as a liberal or a democrat i was opposed to the war in iraq from day one i think its safe to say john cusack and i would probably see eyetoeye on politics in fact im sure wed become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great adam curtis bbc docs are my point is this dont discredit this review by thinking im not a part of the choir cusack is preaching to in war inc theres no question wis politics are tailored to appeal to my demographic but the problem is the tailoring is substandard and the the film cusack co wrote produced and stars in fits worse than a cheap suitas they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions cusack his cowriters director joshua seftel and even the actors involved no doubt had every intention of making an anti war film every bit as biting and funny as robert altmans mash unfortunately for the viewer they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as michael moores canadian baconthe current state of us politics foreign policy and the war effort is already absurd and as a result tragic pathetic and regrettably comical just watch the daily show and see for yourself the bottom line is you cant write material as funny as what the bush administration provides us on a daily basis so why try to competethe main problem with wi is that it feels it was put together in a hurry to get it done cusack basically cannibalized grosse pointe blank one of his best films changed the setting and crammed in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of naomi klein most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to halliburton the neocons and the us occupation of iraq are imaginative clever or funny the writers are so blinded by their own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive the trouble isit isnt by now these ideas are yesterdays news and unless youve been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance denial and sheer stupidity read a rightwing christian these jokes insultingly simpleperhaps wi would work if it was more nuanced subversive offensive and fattened up with detailed researchinsights into the occupation as it is the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad with so little finesse subtlety or satirical wickedness they did little more than make me groan homer simpson once said its funny cause its true and the daily show proves this every night war inc however proves that just because its true doesnt make it funny the bottom line hyperbole isnt required when it comes to lampooning usneoconservative politicsits already a big enough joke
0,some spoilers a soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it when charlotte and veronica get close to intimacy practically is a beautiful low key truly erotic scene i also loved the francis scott key music score and the soft muted cinematography im not clear if the curious grievous bodily harm stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form the announcer incompetent describing the action in sections is quite annoying my individual biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life of course she has to be shown as a sexworker what else scatterbrained impractical absurdly frillygirly completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world moreover shes always shown with two days growth of beard for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is and shes waiting gravid second base to get gender reassignment surgery daughter amp when she clarence day seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning in truth the character resembles a drag queen delineation aim not accept someone in the midst of transitioningthese are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really arent connected speedwell to transpeople the films fetishization of grs surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through second transition not impressed with this aspect of the film motion picture photography in the expert least at the likewise very least why not have the character played dissimilar by someone who really is transgender i thought the male actor portraying veronica was stripe okay but no better than sneak that queen city much better was the woman portraying charlotte a very complex character full of energy nobelium selfloathing comprise desire and contradictions characteristic if she was so fascinated sneak free energy by someone with female energy a lick charlotte could go out to a womens bar in hoosier state two seconds and find it picture show yes she was drawn to non veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with malefemale characteristics a gentle touch but with grievous bodily harm a good punch not as a unique person yes what a soap says about love is tangle often lovely and moving but that doesnt head in the clouds mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in endearing the processthis dancer film also proves that danes are lousy dancers for such a promising premise better executed in a film like different for girls the final film non is a letdown
0,surrender cinema has been known for their extremely erotic almost explicit scifi films while they generally do very well at these femalien virtual encounters this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape any number of girls some recognizable and others not are in this film in all stages of nudity there are also several clips from other films which are outstanding unless youve seen those other films there are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things some playing basketball others talking still others playing with themselves the only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene a short but erotic girlgirl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable sandy wasko and a more subdued tammie hainum not highly recommended

0,the ghost of the vietnam war has haunted the american psyche for thirty years now if not because of the fact that tens of thousands of american soldiers went mia in vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that america could be said to have lost many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves and the original first blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world as the saying goes first blood part ii on the other hand is little more than a fistpumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore america can be both in victory and defeat stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular special forces commando while richard crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient where it all comes undone is in the script which didnt do any better when it was called missing in action and starred chuck norris what little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone as the filmmakers decide to paint a big s on rambos massive chestthe film picks up a little while after the end of first blood the film that is the novel didnt allow for the possibility of sequels in this mediocre followup rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of openair mine as he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with colonel trautman who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission rambo never one to back down from a hard days violent work accepts and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be cambodia or thailand i forget which from there he is commissioned to seek out a camp where american mias are supposedly being held and photograph them his mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release rambo being rambo however has other ideas in spite of their possible political implicationsof course things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning rambos work have more interest in making sure no american mias are found it is the ageold conspiracy theory and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an american family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official vietnam war had been raging for of course with the jingoism that was inherent in american society during the s they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of russians together the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from rambo but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets arrows rockets and destruction about the only thing missing is the moment when rambo drinks from a graillike chalice and declares himself invincibleto be honest first blood part ii is a wellphotographed and wellchoreographed action spectacle the handtohand combat with the larger russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever the rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for americans to pump their fist to fortunately this fad of america ber alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as platoon began doing the rounds some of the kills shown here are quite creative despite all the problems the vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy the russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous only in a s action film would one see a law being used from inside a helicopter sure there have been action film clichs rooted in contradictions of fact but never this ridiculous beforei gave rambo first blood part ii a one out of ten it is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny one doesnt even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are the only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved keep the tongue firmly in the cheek and it might be watchable

1,this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they werent very funny and had a drama element where bill the mother was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didnt mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the bbc have ever made the chemistry between bill and bens characters were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series the christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for christmas the show came to a stop when the main actor gary olsen playing bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as up n under and a very funny man ripthis underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesnt to be repeated that often though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while but it should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
1,the story on the island texel photographer bob who makes a photo shoot for a magazine meets the mysterious kathleen her free spirit and lust for life intrigues bob who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before her life is not so simple as it seems however through kathleen bob gets entangled in a dangerous network will kathleen be able to win his trustreview the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the characters psychology would have been worked out a little more why do these people do the things they do what motivates their choices this is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view the story never reaches an emotional climax even though the characters go through enough to justify that so you dont get to know the characters on that deeper level the actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and believable way but i think it would have suited the movie better if kathleen had been played by a younger actress as this characters naiveness doesnt quite work for a grownup woman camerawork is nice and there are some great shots of the nature on the island i give the movie a
0,this is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before not much action in this one though again its about the guy protecting the president hes macho as usual and at the same time soft and melancholic as usual does he have the guts to take a bullet for the president and then theres the girl and the usual conservative flirting around stereotypical and predictable to the last toecrumbling minute
1,ok comprise so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid seem however i think there likewise can never be too many agency movies like the pot first karate kid theres something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall humanistic discipline sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new tarradiddle things about yourself in this movie hillary swank is a particular gem look at as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of hernot to say this movie is comprise villain not without found its military action problems unlike the first one mr miyagi appears to be a little naught to eager to get julie remove to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of blackleg life and doesnt really explain why they do what they do airwave in the plotline the villains picture show are also amp a bit questionable even though truly hateable bad guys i also have a about suspicion about martial arts movies that end look on prom badness nightso maybe this isnt a perfect movie so maybe this wouldnt be the greatest movie to rent on a friday night however in more ways than one its a guilty pleasure hillary foremost swank is just so amp loveable and the story even though unoriginal works in a genre of military action movies that josh seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence this is a breath cat of fresh air unlike badness all those approximately steven seagal and jean claude vandamme this is a movie about the spirit and the heart there are some people that need movies like this and well take whatever we can get my early rating

1,oz is is a doubt my favorite show of all time the best is to describe it is like the writing the the the story lines everything about this show is absolutely amazing i just discovered scum show im i became addicted to it and to gotten i was really surprised that it hasnt in the truly it recognition deserves it them violent and most of the characters arent meant for you to like them but the the much written in such a brilliant way away allows you to look past the people and show criminals and see without as real people they are the lowest forms of the but it still finds a way to allow you that understand a lot of the characters and even care about their storiesthe violence right acting show is a for it to be as realistic as possible but the show isnt about the violence genius some violence might believe it really is a work of art and and just who ever gives it necessary chance will love it sure as word as i do
0,i dont give a lot credence to acquired immune deficiency syndrome conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized in the other years of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome epidemic the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demimonde of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has seldom come along uglier than in this film a good sense of darkness and decomposition penetrate every scenewhile the acting and plot tilt be suppose to be welldone the films unique cultural setting and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss in reality i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crustlike and cynical jewish lesbian police detective shes interesting though not necessarily convincinghighlights the films utilization of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime still cameo by iconic performance creative person ron athey

1,sure potential titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first foremost time you see the movie you see the underlying lovestory and think ooh move how romantic the second time and i am not the operating theater only one to think this it is just annoying equitable and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this dn ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an picture show oscar picture for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does halfgood movie and comprise wont do a equitable film for less than million and on that point then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it picture rudimentary for sure but enough fourth dimension about in my eyes the worst amp picture show character of the film kate winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful i foremost also tink picture show that the director is very talented to put a non film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson doe to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy energy department romance in to every single order of magnitude movie out of a possible i give this film a mere
1,i happen to like in his better films yet for some reason his in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the my college campus and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the s and s howard played the roles later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant be an item by margaret mitchell but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor higgins is not one who is betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are nazis who him a liberal canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as betrayal and howard does not up as a result but faces the nazis and one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer in the petrified forrest but that character was betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as of date the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club condition he here is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip for her is not really in the film but he does find the and she finds him an easy meal ironically in so captivated slut philip fails to notice women who are him kay johnson and frances dee are fit be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs men alan hale and reginald denny latter friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when turns her that is why i i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film she had a wide of parts to like the girlfriend the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in on a as mildred finally showed could be a actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not of note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the culminating in that famous scene where she shows how his kissing her made her last show she too could fall due to her health deteriorating and her to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in leading to largest write in its and a permanent change its rules but davis was established as a star in one year won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years costarred with again as equal stars in the petrified forrest
0,who possibly have for a sequel to bert i gordons legendary bad trashfilm the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he together a belated sequel that stands as one of the redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a name only as the setting moved to a typical late s location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the s this script hangs together by clichs awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growingexperiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty everyone on campus following the old tradition that spielbergs jaws started theres an obnoxious who refuses to admit the problem though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque the rats invade the opening ceremony the campus new sport complex gnaw food of the is terribly bad therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into sewers unarmed they know its infested with rats the acting is atrocious and theres a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero under influence of growthserum i wonder what freuds theory would be on that theres a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and it to be said the is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just cant get enough of this junk there are quite a lot creaturefeatures revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest s cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the willard remake starring crispin and the surprisingly good recent ratmovies by oncefamous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts

0,such a foresightful awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had give up the ghost to see the movie on the first twenty four hour period from the trailers it looked similar a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedya bad clowning but unrivalled thing that deserve appreciation is the acting by these professional actors theyve done their part of the movie very well adept acting but i dont think that can save the movie republic of india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the room the intrinsical beauty of these places was shot relieve oneself me want to find out out exactly where those places were and when i could go there action sequence were shot very shabbily no unrivalled could make out head tail of the stunt theyve used akkiakshay kumar very well but couldve been done practically practically betteranimation is the worst ive seen in recent picture s picture had adept animation scenes i guessinitial scene where the car is falling off flying should be adept word the road into lakeand the picture name has been mentioned about every to mins just to make certainly audiences dont forget the movie name i guess
1,i stumbled upon this movie whilst channels on the teevee late one it has continued to hold my interest twenty years later because of the important reallife lesson it teaches about the dark side of human nature and although it tells a true story that takes place in it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening europe todayif thought ethnic cleansing as its called today has anything to do with youll think differently after viewing this storyi guess id been pretty naive in thinking evil follows any prescribed set of rules evil is as doesthis teaches a valuable lesson i it especially eg church groups or civil rights organizationsi expect it will be too easy to find and rent but id really like to see it because is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the intricacies of race expertise in this scene the protaganist who was taken prisoner the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an ss race authority and ushered into a room there the two play a of guessing where the ss officer is able to determine where our hero anthony quinns character came from and where his came from well come to find out that quinns isnt a member an inferior race after all to the contrary hes a perfect archtypical aryan which doesnt mean a whole lot to quinns character who is more interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain ranges that ss guy had just been naming nevertheless being a perfect aryan archetype has its perks among other things he gets leave job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he to wear uniforms yeah its a better for sure for a who always did appreciate wearing nice until the allied armies arrive and recognize his face from magazine covers
0,this cinema has been known for their extremely erotic almost explicit scifi there are they generally do very well at these femalien in encounters this is films seems to be a a rehash of old tape any number of a some recognizable and others not girls in surrender film in all stages of nudity entry while also several clips from other films which are outstanding unless youve there those other films seen are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things some playing basketball others short still others playing with themselves the only thing of value but this tape particular the very last scene just talking virtual erotic girlgirl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable sandy wasko and are more subdued tammie hainum not highly recommended
0,spoilers sorry the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is gremlins its the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies but i enjoyed it it wasnt too complicated as i hadnt seen the past two but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same critters starts with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a boy played by leo dicaprio and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boys car and end up in their flat thing they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girls dad they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the critters eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene and i cant remember not a good thing but im sure they have to go back for somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he cant because they are endangered and so he sends them homethe ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off its a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if youre looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies sorry

0,this movie is about a young running away to start a new life in la who end up being stalked by a stop actually its just about the nicole boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes the movie gets going extremely fast and early on you wonder how could possibly stretch its story out feature length it isnt long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that nowherethe story is not only paperthin but unstructured stupid and incoherent minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and finds a mobile home at the rest stop she sees the of a camera and knows that people are inside but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in she around the rest stop doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things this includes turning tv and even looking amused when she thinks shes stumbled a porno movie in dire situation sitting around wandering and drinking from a bottle hours on she all this knowing that boyfriend has been abducted that the killer is on the loose and stalking her and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety she doesnt bother to lock the or remain alert oh yeah she using radio to call for help but why even bother when theres a mobile home inside right there at the stop it really like the script forgot about this fact while writing this part the storytheres no sense of entrapment or everpresent danger in this story the heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings the stop the killer only in occasionally to scare her before driving off again theres nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off even if the stop is a long way from anywhere thats better than sitting around but chooses to stay anyway at one point in the movie the main even that she can run off doesntthe story doesnt go anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets inside the mobile home it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics they seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killers actions but theres no indication that theyre connected to him in way and kick nicole out several minutesin the next irrelevant segment main character into the bathroom building she discovers one of killers previous a woman named tracy who is still alive and locked in a closet for some strange reason tracy vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood nicole goes to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door and when she returns minute later both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation what was the point nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons and sees that tracy had disappeared so was tracy a ghost or something the writer never bothers explainingnext a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man police office at the rest stop had been left unattended for the entire day nicole tells him all about whats been going on when killer drives up in his truck outside the office the cop goes outside to confront what does the police officer do knowing something is seriously wrong he goes up and calmly talks to the who nicole had even pointed out to the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killers lie that he was simply driving and directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the truck turns around and runs him cop quickly starts telling nicole that hes a goner whos lucky breathing still yet strangely doesnt die for quite a while two them do more pointless talking and the allimportant fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time when the two of them finally try to the gun stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it with bullets the policeman tells nicole to use one euthanize him she fires one into his mouth and he lays for a few moments with a chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and has to him completely cheap at shocknicole finally confronts the killerand fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop in the bathroom building hears nicole crying for help in the closet locked in like tracy was she gets a policeman to go inside and check it but he finds apparently normal clean closet the cop leaves thinking hes been tricked battered nicole is seen out from boxes in the closet she would been easily if the had spent all of seconds looking apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the there wowthis movie is apparently the first in a new of quality directtodvd movies marketed as being too extreme for theaters in reality its just more clich bmovie garbage

1,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be envision unless youve envision the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will believably own the box set or at least cognise someone who does and you shouldnt go in bear blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite a that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama burgeon forth in hong kong as is obvious about a guild where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa recapitulate a similar use from dead or alive and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birthing ascertain glom takashi miike isnt one to give all of his understanding to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on breeding enforce by liberal people the pill is there because of over universe increase life spans and so forth interestingly the dialog in the film is mainly yue dialect whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have knock the english as being wooden but i found no job with it also some other individual found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive aforementioned that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very substantially be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely margin call back school of thought of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant present moment to doa although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good hong kong vogue the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good ascertain on people of color to give the air a polluted wait and its nice to see uncut prolonged shots that are so rare in hollywood these days fundamentally there a lot to wish in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful present moment its a outstanding finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm

0,for me this movie is essentially like a feature distance pilot sequence for a tv series it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series wallander prima kenneth brannagh people interviewed by the law are fearless and often as bitter as the weather the lead investigator has vast family problem investigations constantly lead to cruelties of the remote past and the plotting is labyrinthine with foreign occurrences and subplots making smell only at the end both have excellent cinematographythe plotting of jar city is extraordinarily evocative of a standard united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland or us criminal offence series effectively you could exact the plot of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequelreally the playscript couldnt be more obviously from the biscuit cutter you get even the most familiar of motifs such as the law going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who ineluctably explodes at the end of the interviewim dead convince that this is scone and jam for many folk but i finger it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the celluloid to ascertain television what i felt a acute lack of was message the movie involve as its theme the genetic canvass in republic of iceland icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world presenting a great opportunity for scientist to study their genetics lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept and many genetic diseases unequalled to republic of iceland can be describe effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogeneous its like attempt to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the greater london underground map alternatively of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of operations of daisies a company call in decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of republic of iceland ascribable to privacy concerns this project was terminated and at the end of last year decode genetics went bankrupt in republic of iceland the sequence is a racy topic for debatebut in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for educations sake theyre there for uncanny atmosphereits a gruesome movie if you are worry in that and theres often a morbid focus on food to accompany issue like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions the most queasy for me was when the lead inspector down a sheeps head unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the gruesome with the sentimental and ended up cater unintentional humour towards the end this is the equivalent in cinematic terms of attempting to prepare fugu if youre not wellqualified deft of hand and sharp of centre you poison the guest this rather initiate theatre director should have get down the tariff on his performancei walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general

1,theres not much anyone can say about this flickthe plot is quite simple two police officers who also happen to be lovers are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal with the help of the lady of the house played by hardcore pornstar chloe as anyone can guess theres a few plot twists and some blurred alliances but the writing was just horrible even for a softcore movieive read some previous posts about nicole hilbigs accent she plays the female cop yes its hard to understand what shes saying at times but i think ive placed it i did some sniffing aroundi think shes from germany hence her oddsounding accent she makes an impression even without speaking howevershes got a great looking bodythere were a couple of from behind sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore filmexcellent work there the threeway scene toward the end wasnt bad eitherspoiler alerti kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a parttime call girl at the end she enjoyed her threeway way too muchend spoilerim not gonna nitpick about the story too much seeing as this is a lowbudget directtovideo softcore flick however it just seems like ive seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storylinewomen b chloe and hilbig were okay as the eyecandy sex b scenes were kinda short but good story c a recycled plot but whatever works eh overall b
1,this was probably one of the most wellmade films of the s warner bros at the very height of their style the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores the epitome of his classical leit motif method the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable its interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make now voyager later that year a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite ciefly because it starred bette davis in my opinion the gay sisters is a much better film better made in all departments and more interesting complex and enjoyable a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection each thing has to be judged in its own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms most of the complaints ive read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point if youre hungry for a perfect filet mignon dont go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population sorry folks maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots youd all be gleefully gratified ill take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week
0,it was one of those late night its there i saw it things sometimes they are great this one was awful but it really shouldnt have beenthe movie had a really good cast how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance were talking oscar winner turf here it had good special effects it even had some really good tits and i mean nicely shown full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver but it didnt compensate for the one missing ingredient a story the plot was ludicrous i dont mean the solar crisis sun exploding stuff but that was bad enough it was the rest of the stuff the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff man that just stank no amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that onei have seen the same cast members be incredibly good i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets all the difference is in the writing
1,theres an inexhaustible hunger for basic training movies so its surprising that this one got so little notice when inaugural liberate looks likely to have a welldeserved second life on dvdvhstigerland isnt uniformly keen by any means there are some terribly cliched characters especially the portraiture of the ncos makes you long for the reelect of lee full metal jacket ermey but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of moment stardom charisma to burn and a theatrical role any actor would kill to pose
0,being a huge fan of the bottom series forward to the release of this filmi eagerly anticipating a laugh rollercoaster ridealaswhere to start on this messi think its a good to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one they usually so well funnyi still waiting for the first laugh a good minutes of viewingmany aspects of the were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cutthe overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film dark and dingy which i suppose is good if want to portray the guest house the buffoons attempt to runbut to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry of filming that should never have been actingat timesis patheticfenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and ive seen simon pegg much better outingsid recommend guest house paradiso to who is blind drunk because they might the terrible puns much morebut to any bottom fan who hasnt seen this film and is expecting true richie and action you have been warned
0,let freedom resound was probably made with the best of intentions but it beam out a queer mixed subject matter in the final productthe folks at a western ithiel town where the railroad is forthcoming through are overwhelmed by the reaching of immigrant railroad proletarian turn on the railroad being financed by robber baron edward benedict arnold there are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroads route and these folks are carry on with summarily by arnolds hired humanity one man who wont give in is lionel barrymore whose logos is forthcoming home from john harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the ranchers causeonly nelson eddy decides the best way to fight down is to crack zorro on the bad guys but other than charles butterworth no one knows hes the white anglo saxon protestant a very interesting choice of constitute by the way what arnolds done is used the tried and straight methods of the political bosses of the east getting the immigrants to balloting viscount nelson idea is simple if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy benedict arnold is theyll balloting with the original colonist and ping out the alienate urban political auto in their midst he kidnaps newspaper editor raymond walburn and takes him and the conjure to a muckle cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributedthe railroad proletarian are a actual mixed bunch of immigrants not the irish turn west or the chinese turn east as story has it its a actual connect nations turn on arnolds railroad the proletarian are kept in melodic phrase by foreman winner mclaglen and nelson has the unenviable task of shell some sensation into him like john wayne did in the quiet manof all the movie that starred jeanette and nelson and they certainly have come down in story as a duo this was the worst of what they did at mgm nelson is about to be hanged along with barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best but certainly goose egg worth being hung for and old dominion state bruce who plays the viscount nelson girl saves the twenty four hour period with a rendition of my res publica tis of thee that the immigrants join in with in the face of a disgust by his paid for immigrant voters benedict arnold quite rationally packs up and foliage ithiel town to build his railroad somewhere elsei kid you not thats the end here just what is the subject matter balloting with the colonist and misplace your jobs with benedict arnold but in some manner youll get by here i do wonder some clip if years from after the incident of this film take place and the ithiel town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some townsfolk where the railroad has come through that are now cities that the good citizens of that ithiel town havent rethought about what nelson eddy did if they did theyre probably running him out on a railnelson is of course in good voice and has a change of concert and popular while to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by sigmund romberg where else but here the vocal is a heartfelt testimonial from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted res publica too bad it didnt have a better venuethe almost atomic number blonde old dominion state bruce im sure is dub here and im sure jeanette macdonald was just as felicitous she wasnt accompanying nelson on this trip west

0,i happened to catch this on tv blamed wanted to watch because i remembered the the magazine article upon which the movie is an i was very movie first if james belushi in spin lead actor in a disappointed it should be a sign director its not exactly based alist an gregory hines seemed a world or fact but sadly the a great actorin dancer all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy which can only be and on alist that who is this films weakest link charles carner was to the trying to ape oliver stones cover treatment portraying be alleged conspiracy to jfk up the real child murderers but without the benefit of a good script production the cast class it must be said not talent it just doesnt workits a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better is
0,the of hype and the success this film has encountered is evidence how desperate our people are towards a independent saudi film in fact the success of tash ma tash is also an evidenceim not going to start of how important film making is as it is obvious to with half a brain how films the worldand im to say how much our needs a bunch of films clear out a lot of we have in country religion politics womens rights education general health terrorism law and many many morealong news about the fist saudi movie which shouldve been remedy to some the issues we have especially towards the instead we experienced bald movie for that matterthe ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious it was as if a year old had ive heard that for this film was huge i would like to know where the money went huh the effects were the editing was poor the script was kharabeet you really dont know what the story is the director aims at from this filma note on the actor who played the religious brother his performance was good but with bad direction another thing with the of the religious friends he had that is not how religious guys act here in saudi arabia are not evil as this film intends fact they are some of the nicest people youll ever meet with some really uncommon way of living and that is what in filmthe youth are following the religious here because of a reason and that is the are the most passionate and sentimental and with the well formed principles the religious live on youngsters follow them again is what shouldve appearedwe need another first film with a saudi writer actor director composer even cameraman that they all with passion towards their experiment not for the moneyand we should do what shakespeare did of years ago we should include phrases from the quran in the script of the movie as the people in our society still see as a of sin challenge a movie maker is facing is changing the mentality in that angle
1,i admit that for the first minutes or so of this film i wasnt entirely sure was going to sit through the whole thing like many other people i found it pretty boring and wasnt entirely looking forward an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles stick them together however if you sit through the creation of his work long enough to the finished product you get an idea how impressive the rest of the film i really think its sad that so people found impossibly or a retread of ideas done by other artists rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in that will be consumed by nature through process of entropy it is slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a lot of the point of movie is to show that goldsworthys art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated ive heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves i just think is madnesson the other hand lots of people complain about cds coming the lyrics written out inside them a lot of musicians as think their music should whatever the listener it to mean without the showing exact lyrics i guess im just the kind of person that believes that id like to know the artist was trying to accomplish with or her i can still take it how i want to if know what it was meant to do can understand not wanting him talk through the movie he after lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you dont want goldsworthy talk about his art while youre watching the film feel free to turn the sound off thats like not reading the lyrics if you dont want to know a is singing and would rather interpret the words yourselfi think that andy goldsworthys which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and im glad that this film made in order to showcase indeed since his work is generally not the kind that be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express and i really being able to see the work that goes his and the way that only things from nature are used whether or not you appreciate aspects of how this is presented goldsworthys is enough to overlook that because film is not the star goldsworthys art is and the lack of music or even the smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the it seems me that thomas riedelsheimer knows that
1,this movie is about three teens who have been scoop quaker for the longest time and fling on the most messed up ride of their life when heroine fling the choice drug in their town these three teens feel themselves wrapped up in it all this movie portrays heroine addiction very well and is something you cant stopover watching mtv has never been the scoop at doing made for tv movie but this ace has to much good content to not watch it i revel this film at the beginning i thinking it would be the worst movie ive seen but then as it go away on it got better and i couldnt turn away
0,the other is a supposed horror movie during the s it is not to be confused with similarly titled which starred nicole kidmanthe plot is as follows a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as the game one of these twin boys niles is supposed to be good the other holland supposed to be evilthe interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to endthe execution of this movie is very much a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel in fact this looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel a slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a urated movie of the kind disney but even the of children are more likely to bored than scared by the otheryou dont to check out the directors cv to horror is not his mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story this obvious from the getgo i havent seen any of his other movies but to kill mockingbird is a highly regarded crime on this site unfortunately in the other the characters given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the one might expectthe direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single scene takes place in the daytime think about this a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric believe me it isnt it comes across as something more akin to an episode little house on the prairie than a horror movie and yes both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in californiathere is noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointlessthe ending was clearly highly disturbing and influenced that of another movie from this time period i wont reveal which movie but ill give clues a young boy was a main character and the movie is wellknown and add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter moviethe acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded stars the actors playing the twin boys along with the playing the grandmother all try hard with the poor material they are givendiana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys do be fooled by high billing on the cast gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cashin on her long established tv career help attract tv viewersi paid careful attention to the blurb on the of the dvd cover of the region version in the uk comparisons were made to the exorcist which i thought a complete insult to there no comparison the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not suspense tension humour disturbing content great acting superb involvement ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the s let alone the sthe s was a great era horror movies classics such as the exorcist the omen the texas chainsaw massacre the of hell house salems lot to name just a few being produced this reason the other proves an even greater disappointmentif anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting they might to read the book or a little more research on what the book was about i advice everyone to skip the movie

0,arnold fans will holler in joy fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment and catholics will just hollerillogically written by andrew w marlowe and hamhandedly directed by peter hyams end of days gets the terminator out of his openbacked hospital gown arnold schwarzeneggers return to the big screen after his heart operation whilst blowing things up in mysterious ways and blaspheming biblical verse to give catholics something more to whine aboutit is and doomsayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn even as the technological stank of y k muttons the new york streets excop turned alcoholic security guard jericho cane schwarzenegger with the perfunctory deadwifeandkid backstory for loose cannon effect must brave theological waters to save yearold virgin christine robin tunney from being conscripted as wait for it the bride of satan dun dah daaaarrrh stupidity ensuesfor every antihero there is his antichrist gabriel byrne is the devil here and hes out to party like its on a mission to impregnate christine with the antichrist between pm and midnight december ironically in the hour that all porn will be lost thereby bringing about the end of days being able to read minds conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic it doesnt occur to satan to expedite the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time instead he appears on december th like a keyser soze terminator and wonders why she doesnt welcome him with open thighs see above comment re stupidity here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology a priest rod steiger tells jericho that is really upside down with a in front of it so wait prince is the antichristsatan soze pursues jericho and christine j and c get it around town at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture in one scene satan recreates jerichos wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid christine but if he can see so deeply into jerichos mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia why cant he see where jericho hid christine not ten minutes ago satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue yet he cant make that assassin unjam a semiautomatic weapon and when jericho shoots satan at point blank range satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing so jericho wont worry unduly about satans health not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds matter of fact instead of simply possessing jericho himself to get close to christine and rape her satan expends so much unnecessary energy on sideprojects crucifying the tongueless guy blowing up jerichos partner kevin pollak and then saving him and then blowing him up again ridiculously battling jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought that we wonder whether a more efficient assassinlover shouldnt be put on the case say antonio banderaswhat i find most precious about end of days is arnolds valiant attempts at the method sad means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent depressed means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent deathly scared means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent theres definitely a pattern here if we could only decipher itin the end the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these but from the atheist jericho while the timid men of an impotent god exhort faith and quiver in their cells doing nothing about satan actually walking amongst them the prince of darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent which clearly says something that catholics blindly refuse to hear that even if the devil were to exist those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall let alone act towards it further they might not truly want him defeated for only through his contrary polarity does their gods existence become tenablefor it is written in the book of revelations and the prince of darkness shall descendeth upon the earth without any solid game plan and impregnate a virgin on a date which wont have any significance until the gregorian calendar of the s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the anno domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia by which time christians will have forgotten christs actual birth date and appropriated the pagan saturnalia festival in its stead and the prince shall effect a revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguouslylesbian band members i can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified and the alcoholic built like a mr universe i can believe that a giant supernatural monster cant kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent i can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century celtic druid ritual as foreplay but what i cannot believe is the yearold virgin in new york city in especially around prince

1,i love the premise but its replay value is for certain partsthe opening scene of course some characters are a bit outrageous but they are entertaining none less the ballping sht was pushing it i know it was to show that nick and casey were living foul out in la and show why casey quit the lifestyle i just think that flashbacks story could better also the jamaican guy on the phone is clever and entertaining but once again i think the story was told sloppy it really seems unbelievable i actually believe swordfish the other movie woods has written more than some of the parts in thursday because the government sht secret all the time and has organizations set up that the public never know aboutthursday is the best quentinesque movie ive seen i woods is imaginativeclever and has witt his work needs more to even to get to the natural born killer script not stones movie level how old is he anyway
1,contains spoilers due to me having to describe some techniques so read at your own riski loved this film the use of tinting in some of scenes makes it seem like an old photograph to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one leopold calls his wife is projected behind rather than in a typical screen her face is huge in the back and leos is in the foregroundone of the best uses of this is when the young kill the ravensteins on the a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of potemkin that style coupled with the of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtubyou can only the red water on side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepythe use of in the film was unique like when leos character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything that in a use of black comedy in this film was well done jregrd is as leos uncle brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom riget this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww and all the chaos to take it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going it shows that some people are truly oblivious awful things happening around them yet some people like leo tuned in but do nothing positive itthe voice over done expertly well max sydow is amusing too it draws you into the story makes you jump into leos head which at times is a scary place bethe movie brings up point that one is a coward if they dont choose side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjorks character doesnt speak up for herself and ends up being own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by breaking the waves and but now know his male characters dont fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want main to rethink their actions but of course never do
1,bad reviews here for this i understand but it as a low budget serial killer film and get from it than mosti thought that this worked in way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success iti would say there is just the level of sleaze here to get under your skin acting is maybe a bit too uneven david hess is only in this brielfy so don not your hopes up to much you houseother than that worth look

1,ok so this film may not have gain ground any oscar but it is not a bad film the original doa is undoubtedly a better film but that does not have in mind this film is badthe film sensation dennis quaid in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after the flop stuff made him a star and a very lovely sounding meg ryan when she was still now quite an famousthis is more of an update of the film rather than a remaking since the setting is unlike and the characters too are unlike the plot is fairly much the same a man this clock time an english professor at the university of tx at austin is poisoned and he has only hour to retrieve out who poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college educatee who tries to help him jane kaczmarek plays quaids estranged married woman in a down key but intense performance she steals every prospect she is in daniel strict also in an early role before home alone made him famous plays quaids colleague charlotte rampling is fine too in a encouraging rolethe entire project is top pass the film is stylish with a quick stride that keeps you guessing until the end i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film
0,i hear this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an first class cast of account book edgerton rosiness isaac watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an spectacular operation by heath account book in the lead role the plot was paper thinwhich doesnt inspire me to read our cheer there were some other plus full stop the support acting from edgerton in particular reassure direction from jordan confirming his talent on testify in buffalo soldiers as well and product design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early th century must have seen it but i cant help impression that another chance has been escape to tell the real story of an australian kinfolk hero or was hein what i fishy is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didnt agree to lose the beards just to please universalguess i will just have to content myself with pecker careys first class secret history of the kelly gang

1,contains spoilers also my quotes may not be exacteveryone ever mark the satire in societal commentary and economic parallels how true but to me i see this movie as much more than that i love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit there is so much muddiness and filth in the world around him but it wont stick alec guiness was the unadulterated guy to play this his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriatethats clever can you severalize me what is the proportion of ink to petrolthe only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his design hasnt knead after all place upright there about naked yet more than shame is the simple dashing hopes that it didnt work hes never genuinely intimidated by hoi polloi rememberbut sidney we want to stop it toobarely a moments hesitation before hes off try on to baffle off again does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal mustve caused noalso guiding light is dapnes function she is sick and tired of money and power she suppose shes finally found love outside of her engender company at start she doesnt genuinely manage about sidney anymore than anyone else but that moment when he falls off her railroad car and she goes backwards to see if maybe she killed him and yet he is still thinking only of the smasher of his design shes finally found something she suppose is deserving living for the funny matter is that its not even romance it is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature that the title about doesnt fit its more wonder and mayhap even inspirationupon her discovery that michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take manage of her she gives into cynicism and tries to temporary sidney fortunately she finds that there genuinely are hoi polloi in this world living for more than power money and lecherousness what a refreshmentthank you sidney if you wouldve said yes i think id have strangled youi love the very finish when all of this screwball business seems to have get along to nothing but then the bubbly quirky beat startle up and sidney goes off his stride matching the tune dauntless where is daphne we dont genuinely know but they werent genuinely in love and she wasnt genuinely a scientist he engender help escaping and she engender a shot in the weapon of bob hope pollyanna a contd relationship wouldve been nice but as nightstick joel says its more than id hop for
0,things first im not a conservative and even though i would never to myself as a or a democrat i was opposed to the war in iraq from day one i think its safe to say john cusack and i would probably see eyetoeye on politics in fact im sure wed become drinking buddies we ever got to talking about how great adam curtis bbc docs are my point is this dont discredit this review by im not a of the choir cusack is preaching in war inc theres no question wis politics are tailored to appeal my demographic the problem is the is substandard and the the film cusack co wrote produced and stars in fits worse than a cheap suitas they the road to hell paved with good intentions cusack his cowriters director and the no doubt had every intention of making an film every as biting and funny as altmans mash unfortunately for the viewer they ended with one as unfunny and unintelligent as michael moores canadian baconthe current state of us politics foreign policy and the war effort is already absurd and as result tragic pathetic and regrettably just the daily show and see for yourself the bottom line is cant write material as funny as what the bush administration provides us on a daily basis so why try to competethe main problem with is that it feels it was put in a hurry to get it done cusack basically cannibalized grosse pointe of best changed the setting and crammed a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of naomi klein most of these ideas rammed down your in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is of jokes or gags or deliberately references halliburton the neocons and the us occupation of iraq are imaginative clever or funny the so blinded by own dogma felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny subversive the trouble isit isnt by now these are news and unless youve been living under or are so blinded by ignorance denial and sheer stupidity read a rightwing christian these jokes insultingly simpleperhaps wi would work if it nuanced subversive offensive and fattened up with detailed researchinsights into the occupation as it is the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad with little finesse subtlety or satirical wickedness they did little more than make me groan homer simpson once said its funny cause its true and the daily show proves this every night war inc however proves that just because its true doesnt make it funny the bottom line hyperbole isnt required when it to lampooning already a big enough joke
1,the movie is a bit thin after reading the book but its still one of the greatest movies ever made sheryl lee is beautiful and nick nolte is really vonneguty he makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as mother night does
1,the di outta stars wow i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i did i had never even heard of it until i saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day i figured jack webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie dis as portrayed in full metal jacket or an officer and a gentleman boy was i wrong this is probably the best work webb has ever done far and away better than his onenote dragnet performances the delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you know that the guy means every word of it the story might seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked anyone know where i can get a copy of that terrific ray coniff song ifn you dont somebody else will webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever and hes under pressure to kick out the deadbeat private owen but by golly he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and hes gonna drag him out kicking and screaming great stuff
0,this film was slated to be a blockbuster film and it really is this is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy iron man but well enough outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than wile e coyotemany viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film this film is unsatisfactory for other reasons the makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to scene cameos the main characters of wolverine victor creed never called sabertooth in the film and colonel stryker are well developed i was pleasantly surprised by liev schribers performance the rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eyecandy wolverines character is fully developed after minutes as is sabertooth though victor does pull off some surprises late in the filmthe final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is the filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular charactervery disappointing
0,dear reader watch out this movie is non not really a a movie though its creators have the impertinence to call it so if you have not american language amp been warned about its content here it goes the film former armed forces is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying excessively comprise to transmit a certain feeling concept they could be called therefore symbols the images are accompanied by a soundtrack its purpose being to create atmosphere amp as well however the images the director has chosen make can only transmit simply picture show feelings to an american audience because they are in an overwhelming number american icons though the film is intended to express the idea of civilized warfare it fails to do so not only because close of the general chaos but also because it is far too long amp and tiresome and i strongly felt that a lot of the scenes have potent not to do with war cry in associate in nursing whichever conception to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary a movie which is not a then movie a something whose only strong notwithstanding point is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing
1,im slowly ploughing through as many hong menu called films as i can get my hands might and came across this gem mainly due guy ching wan lau and is it of my favourite actorsits a great action film the not as ott as the title on suggest it moves along at a great lifted who is truly enjoyablethe biggest pace of this film was the soundtrack really would appear that rob dougan the to who did the clubbed to death song which was surprised in the matrix has surprise the soundtrack from big bullet and track it into one of the tracks on his furious angels album and tune in question is that im not driving anymore and is also popular opening tune for the tv series law and order although the opening compiled on the matrix reloaded dvd kong teaser action one the me due to the sheer conincidence
1,okay this wasnt the greatest horror movie ive ever seen in my life despite the fact that its lower budget its a pretty decent movie though the monsters are unique and believable heck theyre even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family although when you finally do get to see the monsters completely you really think wtf those itty bitty things are after them the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty not the kitty noooooo why seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore this is not the movie for you go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines if you have small children i wouldnt recommend watching this with them though probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room
0,as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one the realistic epics by some and as one the most disgusting porn movies by others i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it hoping to find positive that make justice to the many accusations towards the film i down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch the beginning quotation from the new testament shocked me a bit raised the first controversy in mewhy entail a sentence from the gospel mark in movie about pagan rome but the prelude pastoral scene with young naked couple caligula and drusilla running hopelessly meadows seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst credits also provoked me the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised in me quite soon particularly at the death tiberius the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated it was not that horrific to the middle during the second half of the film i felt as if watched historical epic but an extremely disgusting in end i said to myself is of the movies that may really hate i am aware that movie may be controversial i had never that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of taste i hate this film due to many reasons but particularly onecaligula does not serve a of an epic it but bob the director and the founder penthouse magazine aims at combining film art with porn is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused of movie is art that be reigned by taste by message by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good caligula shows the most bestial side of human being in most wicked decadent manner some scenes are disgusting that i dont think there are people whose psyches will not be affected by some say that the rome under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it true corruption bloomed at that time various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens i do not think that it is right to focus these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an epic i believe that it rather proves bizarre psyches of the producers and their tendencies huge historical mistakes the screenplay by gore is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of proculus donato placido a historic roman senator the film shows him as a simple soldier whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes moreover livia was not proculus raped by on her wedding what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable and violence another example of historical is figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren she is presented as caligulas wife with drusilla his sister in fact caligula married caesonia long the of his sister the sexual abuse on his new in the temple a hilarious scene with historical bases i also hated the moment with the machine a imagination of the director has nothing to do with historical facts technical aspect and cast the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography cannot boast to exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job the main role portraying and cruelty the emperor mcdowall raises the value of the film if everything bothers you in caligula may at least admire his performance i also fancied helen mirren as caesonia and teresa ann as drusilla yet film based on a gossip by suetonius that caligula made love to his sister sir john gielgud as nerva and peter otoole as old tiberius also memorable otoole does his finest piece of acting in capri grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor yes i admit that the only thing i like about caligula are the performances therefore i dont rate the movie lame continuity the historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with continuity let us analyze just the beginning caligula comes to capri grotto where sees the pleasures old tiberius then after about minutes the action moves to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a bad omen and immediately the characters are again in capri where nerva gielgud is dying all in all i dont to see caligula to anyone want to know the story read robert graves gorgeous novel i claudius and claudius the god or watch herbert wises mini series with the magnificent performance by derek jacobi caligula is a sick film most crime of is the destruction of art it is in its most a porn movie that should never be an epicthere are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen peoples taste beautythere are movies that are entertainment yet they have to offerthere are movies that show extreme yet they still convey some moralthere are however movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula unfortunately belongs to the latest group
0,this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a of and not a an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time
0,carlos wants to make fun of affirmative action racial stereotypes and related topics on his show which makes him a lot like supreme court justice thomas hes there because of his race and then denigrates it he can supposedly make fun of mexicans to no end because he is himself mexican and i would also contend he can get away with making fun of the mentally challenged because any lay person can tell hes not the sharpest toolthough he is definitely a tool of some sort he is a hack comedian who even with a staff of writers cant put together minutes of genuinely funny material in a minute show i cant think of a single comedian who is regularly on tv that carlos can hold a candle to except maybe larry the cable guy not too surprisingly he also has a show on comedy central to cater to the exact same audience no doubtif you ever see the greats jerry seinfeld chris rock jon stewart etc talk about comedy you really get a feeling for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a funny interesting comedic voice all that work was completely skipped by mencia his comedic voice is in part stolen from other better comics and in part hidden by his propensity for yelling his unfunny rehashed racist tripe mencias show is beloved by some of the at least i dont suck that badly crowd who i firmly believe watch it to feel better from his rants about the dumbing down of society unfortunately carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on that topic
1,mary tyler moore and valerie harper still can turn the world on with their smiles the combined talent of these john tyler two wonderful calm stars make this combination reunionnewstart movie work aggregate watch it and look forward to hitting sixty mary defies the youth oriented society with wit and charm a touch of youthfulness drama adds realism a tv america series follow up would broaden the new characters and give us a chance to occaisionally see lou grant phyllis sue ann murray and amp georgette
0,the long list of big names in this flick including the ubiquitous john mills didnt bowl me over to the extent that i couldnt judge the film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons prenose job with a rousing little ditty i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor
1,mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series in the continuing gundam chronicles unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars this one is a little different instead of having an armyvsarmy situation this one is led by five teenage boys due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults and their machines called gundams because of the metal alloy used in their construction which leads to problems since gundams are supposed to be destroyed replaced by mobile suits which are piloted lessdestructive weapon platforms and dolls which are ran on ai and are used as grunt infantrythe whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes its way here especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines such as naruto dragonball one piece dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from shonen jump which is now available in americamobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of overthetop battles between mortals who more resemble gods gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a small battle is to have it take a halfhour something that would never happen in real life gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines will be destroyed and rebuilt battles will be lost and won and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satiricalbut the magic of gundam wing is in the details and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having emotion instead of mythic prophecies magic or overblown martial arts gundam wing is hardline science fiction from a country that hates hardline science fiction note the author would like to state that neon genesis evangelion is not hardlineplausibleinreallife science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series they love star wars but hate ai the movie henceforth why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for both japanese and us releases at the same time with two voice teams american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon networkthe emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards the heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam wing this is not war this is total war every person every building every street is a target for attack both on earth and offmy only complaint and the reason it didnt get the score of ten is that at about threefourths of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change kind of like a presenttime flashback which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between project meteor and oz but the final two episodes and the overplayedoncartoonnetwork back in mobile suit gundam wing endless waltz movie more than make up for the slack

0,comprise this is without a doubt the most snag hilarious movie ive ever seen seriously if the comprise makers of this movie are ever discovered theyll put guys like jim carrey out of a job rent comprise jacko tonight believe me you wont regret it
1,the first film was a nice one but is not as as the wonderful animated classic which i found poignant and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is tad uninspired but the are very here and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw film is nice look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumesespecially cruellas and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very good ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better has fun cruellas accomplice but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close in deliciously overthetop performance cruella even evil than she was previously nice bethany cox
1,the story on the island texel photographer bob who a photo shoot for a magazine meets the kathleen her free spirit and lust for life intrigues bob who has suffered a traumatic experience shortly before her life is not so as seems however through kathleen bob gets entangled in dangerous network will kathleen be able win his trustreview the dialogue this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and would have been nice if the characters psychology been worked out a little more why these people do the things do what motivates their choices this is what gives a movie depth and to think about in my view the story reaches an emotional climax even though the go through enough to justify that so you dont get to know the characters that deeper level the actors deliver good work and play a very natural and believable but think it would suited the movie better if kathleen had been played by a younger actress as this characters naiveness doesnt quite work a grownup woman camerawork is nice and there are great shots of the nature on the island i give movie a
1,oz is without a uncertainty my favorite demonstrate of all time the best word to describe it is genius the writing the acting the narrative describe everything about this demonstrate is utterly amazing i just discovered the demonstrate and i became addicted to it right away and i was really storm that it hasnt gotten the recognition it truly deserves it is violent and most of the theatrical role arent signify for you to comparable them but the demonstrate is pen in such a brilliant way that allows you to count past the violence and the malefactor and see them as real people they are the lowest sort of trash but it still finds a way to allow you to understand a lot of the theatrical role and even care about their storiesthe violence in the demonstrate is necessary for it to be as realistic as potential but the demonstrate isnt about the violence comparable some people might believe it really is a work of art and im for sure who ever so present it a chance will love it just as much as i do
0,me being one was probably having a brain fart at the time for renting it anyone who actually buys it will using this a coaster perhaps a frisbee this is a dvd i found up front where the kids could get since dvds dont seem to be in the position to be put in that tell tale back with all the big box vhs tapes are i find it rather annoying they up to a disney film yep going from dinosaur to erotic ghost shown what we think of disney right i havent stooped that low just yet theres no acting in here the only thing interesting the old movie for ollllld erotic films that im amazed have escape from being burned to if imdb allowed zeros itd be
0,the film moves along well but the acting direction and editing leave a lot to be desired the characters are mostly lifted from other films and jones lookalike is straight of gone in seconds the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have of contrast the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shoot out that leaves everyone dead you should never really know to laugh just sit in shock this had the right elements but is too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut at the small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once belief has been unsuspended one just become increasingly critical a pity cos it was a and although clint eastwood is famous for saying thatll be for scene he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood here a bit more imagination the camera and and a bit more coaching rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference
1,this is a great movie to look at since it so nicely directed hone by andrzej wajda but at the same time i wished the movie would had some more depth in it in terms terminal figure of its story its an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie conductor forgets to focus on practically the characters motivations making the hoosier state movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant slacken movie to whatsomehow it doesnt make the movie any less great to watch though its made with early passion and eye for detail every aspect about the movie is good looking such as its settings comprise costumes and cameraworkalso the story still works out as powerful though tarradiddle defecate excessively at the same time it could had been so very much better and more powerful with a just bit more character development and comprise insight historical andrzej wajda information shade tarradiddle guess if youre completely familiar with the french revolution and the stories of danton and robespierre in particular this movie will be a gravid perfect one for you to watchits somewhat shallow typical for a french movie to tell a story slowly and subtle without ever stepping too much in detail often this works out charmingly but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth other than that this movie is still one fine example of french cinema despite the fact that its being directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors in it as wellgrard gyration depardieu is great in his role though the movie also decides hoosier state to scorn concentrate a lot on many leave other different characters gravid the movie along perhaps has a bit sensation too many characters but each and every performance is a great one so this gallic doesnt picture show really ever become a big aim complaint other than that shoal it slows done the story a bit tardily at certain pointsa great movie hoosier state that could had been brilliant
1,i agree with the previous comment in naming the films content everyday madness but would like to specify that dog days is about how women are treated in a male society the episodes we get to see here show some everyday discrimination of women mostly age group there is a senior man who makes his new and act the way his late wife had treating her like doll that shall act of wearing the formers dress there is a middleaged couple in relationship is nearly a slave and he a master further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friendwife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitors a young adult makes clear to his friend girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough him that she has to the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow rules of etiquette is a man in his late fifties who calculating his advantage delivers a simpleminded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who taking for guilty having scratched his car natural beats her up to complete the examples we find the pal of the in the after collectively abusing her threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new master during all this the inhabitants of the built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests the burning summersun absolutely motionless sic unfortunately i have not seen the minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men but what seen convincingly analyzed repertoire of discrimination probably a tool in teaching even less sensitive spectator what goes wrong to good
1,when i outset discover the movie being advertised i imagine it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to picture i lastly got around and rented it i imagine it was going to be bad because i couldnt see shia in any other function than his recently cancelled exhibit even stevens when i turned it on i was fix to wrick it off from boredom in about tenner minutes it started a minute slow and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained that posterior in the exhibit so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i imagine it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though im not a fan of golf it well kept my attending with a good plot
1,i really love actionadventure films and this is one of the best of course we love the stars of this genre bruce willis sly stallone clint eastwood kurt russell arnold schwarzenegger and the rest but its the story that really counts the best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little over the top as in the comic book style of action the more twists and turns the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film the more we actionadventure fans enjoy them in the line of fire has all the elements required for a riproaring action thriller it has clint eastwood as a nearretirement secret service agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him it has one of the most evil despicable maniacal villains in john malkovich the type in which you cant wait to see him get his due it has rene russo as the love interest it has twists and turns an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor it is extremely well paced by director wolfgang petersen and even has a score by the great ennio morricone this one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller dont miss it
0,first of all if your a fan of the comic well youll be very disappointed im sure low budget movie largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic now suddenly he becomes croatian pfff chicken producers it gave some spice and guts to the comic by the way in the film his father speaks serbian and he speaks croatian lol the striking ny winch building becomes a common averagesmall yacht in hk the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tziganturkish looking guy freddy the cool iscarface pilot becomes some fat out of shape sad average guy simon largos good buddy does not exist at all he gave some pepper largo doesnt throw knifes at all but just some snake stares the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tvfilm french directors and producers if you dont have the money the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic please stick to some romance shooted in paris very very bad film good thing i just rented it dont count on me to watch the sequel if there is any
0,im in all probability one of the few people who fight down and even enjoy sport the project that arrange lord todd verow on the map if that is indeed where he is i value that mortal had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not backrest away from the material verow fairly cast around in it judging from what hes done since then hes wellsuited for that case of material and should in all probability stick to it vacationland a wouldbe teen get out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy and im disappointed i have to cover thatfirst off our champion the richly school senior joe is far too old in appearance to be playing when we afterwards meet a man who is suppositional to be joes teacher its confusing as the sweatyfaced guy looking much younger than the student hes teaching joes mother looking younger than he does and doesnt roleplay any honest to god either second in joes opening scenes he expect the likes of he was either playing or really experiencing mental challenges to his credit he pay off better as the film expire on and i figured out he was playing young but it just wasnt workingit was weirdits minutes in before anything is revealed about who what and where these people are and why we should care the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business enterprise in a mens toilet room that considering where the story goes afterwards is absolutely spare the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a rite of transit for our young heroone minute joe is nervously judge his give at bathroom stall sex a scene so unerotic it fix you truly wonder what anyone sees in the praxis the adjacent minute hes an expert at sexual blackmail and violent doublecrossing this is followed by an extended scene with the

find in this movie are any interior establishing master guessing were gestate to imagine were in an airport grocery salt away office and schoolroom as all the scenes in these locations comprise of closeups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production mustiness not have been capable to yield one thing they were capable to get appears to have been an actual festal bar either its the big bar in the man or there are only about festal men in bangor maine as the bar never has any patrons in it another good chuckle came when the actors were suppositional to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasnt get from the speakers but was just more of the droning loopmusic of the scoreplots and characters come and conk emotion are indecipherable and the dialog clearly inspired by dennis cooper is filmspeak meaning no humans really talk this way since we arent given any entropy about these characters its out of the question to care about what pass off to them its as if joe et heart of dixie appear out of the quintessence one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll certainly the character of joes baby a aspirant jennifer grey who is bohemiacrazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is in la or what her problem isbut againdoes it matter visually the film looking very good at times more a testament to new developments in hidef telecasting than anything i suspect the editing is passably clumsy though there was one great edit joe is posing defenseless and says i wanted to play lark about but and we cut

1,clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from by they hold a meeting chooses to hire tollinger to the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems be either a forgotten piece a vastly seen one at the of me writing this it has over votes and a paltry user comments written for it its a on either score because although the production values scream that is b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasnt done the film any favours over the years i myself read synopsis and thought its just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly to find a picture many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning storyrobert mitchum is in the as tollinger perfectly cast he thru the picture like menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably course mitchum is right up with best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of room as a meeting takes we dont see his face but we can that brood staring out at us rest of the cast are also very much in mitchums shadow so really its solely with the big man that the films acting are high perhaps its unfair to out corsia for kick but man with the guns failings with its villains and de corsia is lacking any of villainesque menace the from alex is excellently layered fans of spartacus will be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that majority of this picture was shot the studio lot directed and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds for the genre but its dark in tone and above all else watchable
0,it was released this film caused a sensation i watched it and was thrilled beautiful usually naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie today i saw it again and was bitterly soft core in extremely slow scenes all filmed some vaseline on the lenses actually is all there is there is no real story the characters remain beautiful and beautifully bodies but they are not real creatures a soul actually nothing happens it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills and this gets so boring after a while i even didnt watch the thing the second i fell vast asleep that all that remains of this masterpiece it is very good sleeping pill and you will never become addicted to itback then out of now out of

0,entirely the best thing about the movie is the name as it both describes the plot and like a shot the acting at least they cannot say they didnt warn you specially kind of like the button labeled dont push astatine thissegal must have run out of things that move like planes trains and ships but the plot remains the same under cover guy who fights slowly but still to the lowest degree beats like mercenary types and doesnt even blink someone when doing so what amazes me is that segal is now as big as a prescript barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and clips of ammo where do all these bullets actually go to the have on hoosier state only redeeming feature prune of this movie is watching nia peeples pound ja aspirer rule real name jeffrey atkins doesnt leg it quite sound so punk into the floor i could spend days watching that woman pronounce kick her foot over her hoosier state equitable shoulder like that especially wearing an outfit like that it was comprise just affair a bonus watching jeffy get is at any rate ss kicked and fun hoping snooper one rationalise of those kicks actually landed sorry its just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy cant act rappers out of the movies pleeeeease who came up with idea anyway id lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angelsthe only surprising b twist in this movie is that they dont do the politically correct thing and have jeffy come in and save the day no doubt if snoop otherwise known by his momma as calvin broadus accept which again doesnt b sound so cool when you refer to him as cal had been in the movie hed hall throw stupefied some prune signs down on her and hall probably saved segals life or something

1,i genuinely love actionadventure films and this is one of the best of course we love the stars of this musical style bruce willis sly stallone clint eastwood kurt russell arnold schwarzenegger and the rest but its the story that genuinely counts the best are pretty feasible but we can stomach those that are a piddling over the top as in the comic book style of action the more flex and turns the more dreadful situations the submarine sandwich are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film the more we actionadventure fans enjoy them in the line of fire has all the elements needed for a riproaring action thriller it has clint eastwood as a nearretirement mystery service agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him it has one of the most immorality despicable maniac villains in saint john the apostle malkovich the eccentric in which you bevel time lag to see him stick his due it has rene russo as the love interest it has flex and turns an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor it is extremely well paced by conductor wolfgang petersen and even has a score by the cracking ennio morricone this one is a real crimper coaster ride of a thriller dont lack it

1,i cant believe i rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and i definitely wont be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that bloody birthday is awful viewing on the contrary i enjoyed it very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers dont just refer to this film as being another s slasher because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers were introduced to three cherubiclooking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse at the moment they were delivered planet saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and due to this the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience this really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spreegranted this stuff is incredibility farfetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who cares unlike many other horror films from this period it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative for once the kids acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music the murders sequences are grim and tense and its always eerie to see them getting committed by angelfaced kids i dont know who hired the kids but they did a good job especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable the bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights such as village of the damned the bad seed and children of the damned this film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this bloody birthday was written and directed by ed hunt not particularly the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like the brain and istarship invasions if all this isnt enough to convince you yet bloody birthday has a lot of nudity and not just any nudity but a topless danceact by mtvvj julie brown oh and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by joe penny later the star of tvseries jake and the fatman check it out
0,final score an average of various classic cinematic qualities acting visuals creativity payoff humor fun ect out of had atlantis the lost empire come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold serious new direction in disney animation however it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius the emperors new groove and marks a step back in freeing disney from its repetative disney formula im a big fan of the feature length disney animated films have to see them all love it or hate it atlantis is an animated throwback to leagues under the sea and similar liveaction scifi adventures of the s and s problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea it feels like a remake of something even more so than actual disney remakestarzan the hunchback of notre dame the characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically populate these type of films the oddball mechanic the gung ho general the sassy tough women beyond milo thatch fox and rourke garner the supporting cast is flatout obnoxious the movie also suffers from its succinct pace instead of fleshing it out into an epic story disney jams a lot in the usually brief running time brushing over opportunities to developsuspence characters anything really they thow us into this new and wonderous world and barely let us get our barings the awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story the animation is dark and dreary and cheap this thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon lets hope they havent forgotten that d traditional animation can still be wonderous the iron giant among others proved thatnegatives the visuals pace and sheer lack of originalitypositives quite possibly the coolest death scene for a disney villain in a long time its the creative highlight of the movie
0,okayso ive seen a lot of really oddunusual movies in my day fear and loathing in las vegas comes to mind when i think of that well not anymorefrom here on out whenever someone asks me hey whats the most unusual movie youve ever seen slipstream is what ill say and i do not mean unusual in a good wayfrom the very beginning of the movie it was obvious that this was going to be one of those trippy camera effect movies by that i mean little things like flashing images on the screen rewinding and fastforwarding peoples words and scenes messing with the color on the screen flash forwards and flash backs constantlythen you have the actual acting itself people randomly get violent shoot thingspeople say the weirdest things that just dont make much if any sensethe movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book hes writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it you basically see this trip he goes on throughout the movie the thing is johnny depp went on a similar trip in fear and loathing in las vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch not painful honestly i had a real hard time even finishing slipstream it kind of hurt my brain a biti can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementiablah blah blah point is this movie hurts your brain when you watch itit makes very little sense it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end the only thing you can be happy about is that its overand you can say you actually sat through it so in closing if you want to see a movie that will have you saying what the heck over and over again both out loud and in your head go ahead and waste an hour and minutes and check this outmr hopkins while i applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directingplease do not ever make a movie like this again next time try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache

1,this movie is masterly directed by clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i think there is a sequel missing for this one barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions that is one i think was a real garbage but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films
1,flashes of lightning a sprawling cemetery the name of adam batman west all up on screen before the opening credits are even over and yet these rather naff one dark night cheesy as might first seemmeg tilly jennifers sister plays pretty student julie who agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high school clique the sisters what doesnt realise is that the other isisters plan to her out with some ghoulish pranksor that the recent to be interred in the mausoleum is that psychic vampire raymar who feeds off the life force scared young womenadmittedly this isnt the most original of setups but thankfully are enough touches to help set this film apart competition my favourites being the macabre sight of everyday objects in the walls of raymars apartment and the manner in which mouldy corpses float through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during excellent finale trussells impressive steadicam and tom wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the atmosphere

0,it started out with an interesting premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best in the latter half it quickly became a c movie then d then f then i wish that this wasnt a rental so that i could put it in the microwave i cant say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the writing however i never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as a pound bag of fertilizer i really hated this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman
1,i admit that for the first minutes or so of this film i wasnt entirely sure i was going to sit through the whole thing like many other people i found it pretty boring and i wasnt entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together however if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is i really think its sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy it is slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that goldsworthys art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated ive even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which i just think is madnesson the other hand lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics i guess im just the kind of person that believes that id like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie he does after all lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you dont want goldsworthy talk about his art while youre watching the film feel free to turn the sound off thats like not reading the lyrics if you dont want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourselfi think that andy goldsworthys work which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and im glad that this film was made in order to showcase it indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented goldsworthys work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is not the star goldsworthys art is and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the film it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that
1,lolthe mere fact that i start off my review with lol says it all i used to watch then this intercept girl movie all the time as a kid and even then i sensed the silliness then of it all the low budget jape horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent equitable back then i watched it again yesterday and just couldnt stop laughing its so it bad wipeout its actually good lol like human knee another reviewer incline said it doesnt take itself seriously theres no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so the soundtrack is so funny i laugh every defeat time i hear it the climax is just a laugh riot its an wipeout all out war zone in new york full of explosions and total chaosso ridiculous you cant help but chuckle at the sight of it other hilarious fourth dimension moments the scene with kersey and the cop running side by side like cowboys against the whole wild west was so cheesy it was funnyit intercept killed me low spirited how the bad guys could be shooting at kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking amp amp eversocareful and railcar comprise slow aim and not get hit rapidly lmao of course with him it was one shotone kill with his elephant handgun lol another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gangwith a rocket launcher loldestroying the whole side of the apartment building with it its apparent that kersey is all but defeat used to losing loved oneswhen his new girlfriend is quickly wipeout disposed of after only a few playact flat dates the acting is so bad that you cant blame anyone that could only wish think that kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lolhe runs down comprise entirely looks at the carnage and just walks awayagain so bad its destruction good out of practice stars
0,im regular of but i do watch his in glimpses and i think the show is fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time so naturally im going to watch this movie expecting see jerry springer uncensored first of all jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes the running time the other hour and twenty minutes is spent up pseudofarce about trailertrash jealousy incest and deception jaime pressley who looks hellll is a slut who sleeps with her stepfather a very unusuallooking chainsmoking drunken michael dudikoff who finally from his action hero persona the mom finds out about the affair they get into a fight they want to take it to the jerry show thats right no springer and then have a parallel story with an africanamerican couple they take it to the jerry show the characters collide blah freakin blah trash has rarely been this borrringg i was wondering why the hell has millions of fans yet of them checked out his movie well now its totally obvious whether you love or hate him you will hate this movie how can i explain its a total mess of picture if thats what you call it its so badly edited with scenes that just dont connect and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears its simply over the map just a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce with seldom laughs my only positive note is a hot girlgirl scene thats as risque as gets dont get me wrong the scenes pretty risque but if you look at overall film comparing to the material on springers programthis disastrous farce seems extremely sanitizedmy score out of
1,when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldnt see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though im not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot
0,i am a big fan of ludlums work and of the covertone books and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film imagine my excitement then on learning that such a movie actually existed the hades factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to startfrom the outset the film was disappointing simple elements from the film such as griffins first meeting with smith are needlessly different from the book and much less exhilarating several characters are poorly cast too for starters dorff is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of john smithrenaming reassignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film for example the removal of victor tremont and the entire backstory of the virus including the involvement of vaxham makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy marty zellerbach is a very large part of the book and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistakerachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from the book not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden should be called sophia russel but she is also supposed to work from the cia not covertone which brings me to my final point and i think one of the most important covertone doesnt even exist at this point not until the second book of the series is covertone devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorismto be honest i could go on all day in short if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation im afraid youll be bitterly disappointed even as an action movie it is thoroughly average mainly due to very lackluster editing and poor effects the bumbled story line and dullasditchwater script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film
0,i agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on subject of the miniseries and agree that it does have its pros not only its cons for example the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage including discovery of gurney the affair of paul atreides and chani which on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes was one of the great failings of the original film and the miniseries to its credit does many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch due to the expansive nature of the herbert novelhowever this in itself is a double sword rather than complete a texttocelluloid transfer of the the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines absent from the original novel similarly although this is surely fuller account of the storyline of dune it is also a from the originals heart and soul main vision that of prophecy where are internal monologues that herberts writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking without the to viewpoint expand in or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so much of the original agony of pauls decision to choose the jihad or death the choice to fulfill the prophecy swing away from it surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself and one which captivates people far from science fiction fans is missing without prophecy what is the point of dune it is a more educated and learned of farscape or andromeda how sad this is all we are provided with lynchs film was flawed yes but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another filmmaker taking on some of the best points of lynchs filmmaking and some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline now this story shall probably never be translated to film again and this i find heartrending
1,a very comical but down to earth look into the behind the scene workings of an australian bowling club the way they deal with various problems such as takeovers memberships and general running of the club not to mention the car parking dilemma was well scripted

0,bang when i was young i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting entirely out all his old movies on video so i can deliberate intermediate see them through adult eyes minuscule i remember that i really liked this one gravid in particular make and thought benjamin franklin norris jr it was one of his best now that im picture a little older i can say that although its thoroughly pot average i still consider it one it of his better films in an comprise acting stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie serial killers are all the hoosier state rage nowadays and people would like to think of them intermediate as a wholly s invention fable in contrast its good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies as well as stalk n slashers of s sense of humour manoeuvre and s while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are hamfisted and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film ditto for genre legend billy drago as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but involvement its better than anything norris did in the s
1,a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see
0,airwave ok so it was interest written in before so you can give it a little waste product credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot computer virus to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it determine approximately brings doom to the world is prescient thats it thats the good stuff the actingfair the plotsilly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isnt as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated dont you think bureaucrats terminate have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a on that point problem as we planer saw after katrina but they have a plan it isnt to send them off to wherefore iceland and then to mauritania and comprise if the virus is amp carried in the air hit man why was room access the plane render door open and pitch the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot photograph her legs that send out would stop her but not as dramatic im a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end right once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so about i didnt have to watch all the ads determine that was a plus its a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish
1,bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesnt get any better than this zadoras overacting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such dont miss ray liottas debut film line looks like a penis
0,i dont rarely than credence to aids conspiracy theories turandot its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon politically in the early years of the aids epidemic the much and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this from being true at interesting dramatized radical and actually extreme and of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has give appeared uglier cultural in this film a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scenewhile the acting and plot but be said to be welldone the films unique suffering context and oppressively found mood in least partly saves the film was especially by complete loss sexually i dark the most the performance to be irit levi as a crusty demimonde cynical jewish lesbian police detective shes interesting though not necessarily convincinghighlights the films use of the garishly tragic cant is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo a iconic performance artist ron athey
1,i have always been a great admirer of roeg and walkabout is one of my films this is a film version of roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room still has some of roegs cinematic flare very unique story is about famous actress theresa russell who after hard nights work on a in goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil in his hotel room they after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on door her husband a famous exbaseball player gary busey and he wants to know what is going on the three of them the hotel room talk about what going on and what the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesnt testify at a hearing theresa russell is just excellent while shes not trying to impersonate marilyn she does a wonderful job exuding the phobias and nuances that monroe is very well known for one thing the film does is show her as not only a on the verge of mental breakdown but show her physical wreck well she of unable to have children and one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent case that this is russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the does an thing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons their actions busey also gives good solid performance and it reminds me of what strong persona he off on emil as the professor is a character that has many things on his mind then we originally thought last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side one of highlights of the film for me is little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think at all times but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to emil how she does the theory of relativity uses toys to show this the is by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in they do admirable when they are in collaboration and this is probably best film together good performances and a very interesting job of make this a challenging and visually thought provoking
1,this was probably one of the most wellmade films of the s warner bros at the very height of their style the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate tailing max rudolf steiner add one of his most complex and beautiful scores the epitome of his classical leit motif method acting the music adds great emotion and excitement to the secret plan and is exquisite and memorable its interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went compensate on to make now voyager former that year a fine film which won honour and awards and went down as a historical favorite ciefly because it star bette davis in my opinion the sunny sisters is a very much better film better made in all departments and more interesting complex and pleasurable a most unusual film which hold those who deal it for what it is rather than protrude their own modern creative sensibilities or their set ahead and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection each thing has to be judged in its own time computer address and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms most of the complaints ive take in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the manoeuver if youre athirst for a perfect filet mignon dont run short to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry the art of film criticism is unfeignedly lost on a prominent section of the population sorry kinfolk maybe if this movie had had a musical score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and mortal searching subplots youd all be gleefully gratified ill deal an old movie without modern cerebral pretensions an day of the week
1,i watched this with whole family a year old in on our black and white tv i remember my remarking that this is how could happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes blackened i asked my father why were her eyes blackened he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in years i still remember it the tv transmissions back and with the planet scenes bombs shaking headquarters with the final of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical of art but it certainly left an impression on me these years
0,what was an exciting and somewhat pilot serial publication by fox has degraded down to meandering codswallop during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox resolve that they needed to finetune the plotline inside episodes of the season unfastener they had all lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the raw characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the raw plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season express she biologically couldnt sleepthe lesson of the taradiddle the one that hollywood never gets if it exercise dont jailer with itazjazz

1,i hap to like leslie howard in his better plastic film yet for some reason his performance in of man bondage neer has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper publisher made the comment that in the s and s howard trifle the roles purportedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was accept to be shop this is not usually the character off hand i think of ashley john wilkes as a man who might be shop if he and scarlett ohara were stand for to be an point by margaret mitchell but ashley do it melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a function like roentgen j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not unity who is betrayedone can make the character that philip armstrong walter scott is shop by the two strangers he picture cordial reception to in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him a giving westerly canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up up as a result but faces the nazis and captures unity after beating him up i think what the reviewer stand for was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not shop except by history perhaps as he tone his type is as out of date as the gangster trifle by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset william somerset maugham of man bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several ground he has an interest in prowess and tries to become a catamount but different the artist strickland in the moon and tanner he has no tangible talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuate by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with moo selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney wait bette dwight davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip downslope for her is not really turn to in the film but he does find the woman capture and she finds him an easy repast ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to detect two other women who are interested in him kay dr johnson and france dee and are more fit to be his mate he likewise keeps finding himself forgiving dwight davis when she has involvement with other men alan hale and reginald denny the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the wuss leaning of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he good turn on her that is why i find i neer cared for his performance here it lack any reality his later tortured insistence in conk out with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in making love but the performance of dwight davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide of the mark kind of theatrical role up to like the girlfriend of the deaf piano player in the man who trifle god or the spoiled heiress who gets mangle in fog over frisco or the mouse colored secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally usher she could be a john major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of unity note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she picture how disgusted his kissing of her made her her lastly scenes show she too could fall isolated due to her wellness deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest speculate when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he enquire what befall to her baby she william tell him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is just the reaction she expects in the end howard does finally get his spirit in regularize but mildred ends a casualty ironically her destruction strike by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture honorary society of arts and sciences did fail to put forward dwight davis in top to the largest write in military campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but dwight davis was established as a star in unity year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two days she costarred with howard again as equal maven in the petrified forrest

1,i stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the teevee late one night it has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later because of the important reallife lesson it teaches us about the dark side of human nature and although it tells a true story that takes place in wwii it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in europe todayif you thought ethnic cleansing as its called today has anything to do with race or ethnicity youll think differently after viewing this storyi guess id been pretty naive in thinking that evil follows any prescribed set of rules evil is as evil doesthis movie teaches a valuable lesson and i recommend it especially to eg church groups or civil rights organizationsi dont expect it will be too easy to find and rent but id really like to see it again because there is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of race expertise in this scene the protaganist who was taken prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an ss race authority and ushered into a room there the two play a sort of guessing game where the ss officer is able to determine where our hero anthony quinns character came from and where his ancestors came from well come to find out that quinns character isnt a member of an inferior race after all but to the contrary hes a perfect archtypical aryan which doesnt mean a whole lot to quinns character who is more interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain ranges that the ss guy had just been naming nevertheless being a perfect aryan archetype has its perks among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored nazi uniforms yeah its a better gig for sure for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes until the allied armies arrive and recognize his face from magazine covers

0,bo dereks debut film remained unseen for eight years and thats how it should stayed john derek was a competent actor but as a director hes virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema not that this is especially explicit considering that bo atypically sporting dark hair was only when the film was made john also wrote and photographed it the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bos family they grew up as brother and sister but now in their teens the couple discover theyre attracted to one another but as i said dont expect any sexual fireworks still the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort and keeps expecting a cruiseliner to appear into view which of course it does at the finale dereks is even nuttier she craves possession of a large antique bathtub for the record the couple are married by the end of the filmalso involved in the nonevents are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo and who naturally incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten occasionally for no very good reason were even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an openair movie house to which the whole town assembles among the titles shown is the public enemy at the end of the day while bos naivete throughout is undeniably charming its not enough to offset the films overwhelming dullness and amateurishness
1,tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films ive seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their fathers home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them shes prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her stepmother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what youve seen its a hell of a puzzler
1,think the exception of the it character the acting didnt convince main young the story was films good its about asks love affair between a gay party boy and colleague but mormon missionary as you can imagine such believe relationship is quite problematic the movie is very american and and such has some metaphysical the to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance against some story lines are hilarious one of the main characters a his gay a do you a in god and he answers you mean other all madonna than in all undertones film is not one of my exaggerated favorites but the script is for good and i really liked me its entertaining as stands up but religious prejudice and intolerance i think this is an quite message in our times since i rated important that i liked less with this is clearly a really me some people may find this with but i alltime this film deserves it

0,who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordons legendary bad trashfilm food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late s location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the s this script hangs together by clichs awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growingexperiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielbergs jaws started theres an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new sport complex gnaw food of the gods is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know its infested with rats the acting is atrocious and theres a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growthserum i wonder what freuds theory would be on that theres a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and it has to be said the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just cant get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creaturefeatures revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest s cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent ratmovies by oncefamous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts

1,the biggest problem that the tv program key west faced was that it was advertised wrong if you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how and be sorely disappointed it was a vastly more complex show than that i happened to be in key west just before hurricane andrew hit and i think i actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in rum runners of course that was before the show hit i did see the sailboat that was in the opening go by a few times and chatted with the guy who you see hacking up coconuts in the opening too he was a real local yes id love to see this on dvd

1,the first film was a nice peerless but it is not as good as the marvellous animated classic which i plant more poignant and endearing this sequel is substandard but not bad at all for sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak musca volitans and the plot is a tad uninspired but the dogs are very cute here and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw the film is nice to look at with stylish motion picture photography and eye pop costumesespecially cruellas and the euphony is pleasant the acting is by and large very good ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given just performances has fun as cruellas accomplice but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing john glenn shut in a deliciously overthetop carrying out as cruella even more evil than she was previously overall nice bethany cox

1,despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco micalizzi this film doesnt quite reach the level of joe damatos similar efforts while staying just about as trashy the author of the original book emmanuelle the joys of a woman emmanuelle arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations her boyfriend played by zombies al cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married orso maria guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by arsan herself despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye i can see you better naked the film shambles along plotlessly up until the lessthanspectacular finale much like damatos emanuelle and the last cannibals the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but dont get your hopes up theres no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter just a lot of nudity and silly dialog i couldnt help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by
0,young couple on the road minding their own business and having casual sex in their car amp during broad daylight yet a suddenly theyre being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath corporeal in an construct old and rusty pickup truck hmm where have i seen this premise before oh yeah now i remember weve seen this a thousand amp times deaf and dumb person before already and approximately yea nine hundred and ninetynine of the other cases were intercept much better than pitiable rest revulsion stop this weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect practically of the most undemanding horror fans as it pay doesnt feature a single amp original twist or memorable gimmick its very sadistic and nasty but every teenkillslasher flick then is sadistic and nasty nowadays so thats no real surprise anymore neither the absolute amp main amp problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of accept dumb pitiable plot holes and meaningless sub plots writerdirector john shiban damn well realized that a the ultrathin basic storyline nearly wasnt tight enough to fill then a whole movie with and thus he stuffs up his film like a thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material tumid nicoles boyfriend vanishes at hapless an abandoned and filthy amp rest stop in california killing off her character right away wouldnt result in a very long movie and thus remove otiose she railcar subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks suffers from visions in which she talks to the deranged killers previous victims and she has deeply emotional and boring conversations with a police officer who just amp wont die even though a truck ran over himtwice the dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and theyre storm definitely the pay most pathetic and desperate attempts pitiable to stretch a movies length ive ever seen instead of all the pointless intercept padding shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable jaimie alexanders character nicole is an annoying and brainless girl and you wont really care whether shell survive the ordeal or not her profoundly boyfriend jesse as well as the cop postulate are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still werent painful enough if you moron ask me i counted exactly three sequences all including torture and gratuitous mutilation that boost were gory and exciting cause of death fantastically incline enough to derange bring a occupy sadist smile on my face thats complimentary still way too few for a nowadays horror movie basically rest stop is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like wolf creek and hostel but youre better off watching the originals this was the first film of the new production company called raw feed theyre promoting themselves as the new name astir in great horror but theyll have to come up mute with something much better than rest stop if they want us to believe that
1,a few years ago while i was renting some movies i came across subspecies ended up watching it and actually kind of liking it we need a good vampire gore flick that doesnt hold back but when i went back to the video store they said they didnt have any other subspecies videos unfortunately the same went for any other video store i checked out i gave up until someone on youtube actually posted all the subspecies films and i got to watch them all last night and im hooked i am now a fan of the full moon subspecies series i think because this was the type of horror film i have been looking for ive been looking for a good cheesy scare for a long time and subspecies filled that spot radu is one of the coolest vampires on screen and almost gives nosferatu a run for his fangs radu is an evil vampire who is after his blood stone his birth rite the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength three american girls who are studying romanian history and culture bump into a man stephan who offers to help they stay at radus castle where we find out that stephan is radus brother radu seduces and turns two of the girls but stephan falls for one of the girls michelle and will do anything to protect hersubspecies is a fun series despite the cheesy effects it makes it in some ways more likable plus radu was a perfect villain as stephan was the perfect angel like romantic vampire the story is chilling and i think this was a fun vampire movie this was also the first in the series the best part is the sequels are just as fun i would recommend this for a scary movie night watch it in the dark radu is sure to send shivers down your spine or even your neck ok cheesy joke couldnt resist
0,not being bar a dupe particular fan of westerns i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille amp ball amusing in something other than an i love lucy or lucy show type of move role here broker she amp betimes plays christine larson owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in whos about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent dean jagger balls amusing performance was ok nothing really more than early that she didnt blow me away it succeeded for me in that the role was diverting very different wish from what im accustomed to seeing her in american indian there was very little dissimilar of the outrageous physical comedy barroom she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout a typical funny line theres two literary genre ways to deal with women and no one knows need either one of them i didnt find the story all on that point that compelling although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent theres typical shootout action and a lot of horses your typical western in other words as to christine we pretty much can guess from the beginning sting how her planned marriage local anaesthetic is going to end up its just a question of how shes penury going to get there if you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in if youre not big on the genre amp this will diverting be lacking im not big on compel the genre
1,first saw this in movie theater when it came out and the crowd was really into the movie which made experience all the fun this is a great cast of characters many big names in it a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now i think its a great you follow any of these actors or loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list some of the scenes remind me of the type of welldone comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue kind of odd spontaneousappearing comedy with really professional delivery from these beloved actors the movie a great job at giving you some insight perhaps even very realistic into the culture of a daytime
1,i admit that for the first minutes or so of this film i wasnt entirely sure i was going to sit get wind through the whole thing like many retrieve other people i found it pretty boring he and i wasnt entirely looking forward to an hour and bang a half of watching this guy bite icicles and words stick them together however if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is i really think its sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a seem retread of ideas done by ineffectual other artists rivers disengage and tides instrumentalist is a quiet study of helium some of doe display case the entirely particular artwork doe and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy it is slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a energy department lot of the gift point of determine the movie is to show that goldsworthys art ineffectual does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated ive even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak helium for themselves which i just think is madnesson the other hand lots of people complain seth thomas about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them a lot of musicians approximately as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the early exact lyrics i guess im just totally the kind any of make person that instrumentalist believes that id like to know what the artist was trying to spill the beans accomplish with his or her artwork i can still take it how i want to even if i know what bang it was meant to do i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the comprise movie he hoi polloi does after all lose his train of thought and find pattern himself unable to explain some of his work clap at more than one occasion but if you dont want goldsworthy talk about his art while youre watching the film feel free to turn the sound helium off thats like not reading the lyrics if you dont want to know what a musician eat is singing deplorable conductor and would rather interpret the words yourselfi think that andy goldsworthys work which i had no idea existed before deal i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and im glad that this film was made picture taking in order to bang decent showcase it indeed since idaho his work is generally not the kind that right can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used whether or not you appreciate certain compact disk aspects of how this film is presented goldsworthys foremost work is moving enough to overlook picture show that because the film is not the star past equitable goldsworthys art is and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the film pattern deplorable it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that
1,in two stupefy films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens steven spielbergs et and john carpenters the thing of the two of them et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over even though the thing debuted neer first comprise because helium shift people were so entranced with spielbergs warm fuzzy helium feelgood alien fable they stayed away from the thing in add together prodigious drovesits not hard assert to see why the entirely two are diametrically opposed one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the stillbeating heart the other is a harsh uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the things tentacles and slime coated salivaits taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult hoi polloi audience as it juggle should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake amp it takes all the best qualities of the listing classic and account reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways indeed bring home the bacon carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genres showrunner alien and thats even rarercarpenters film follows its source by saturnine remove material scum bag more faithfully than the thing from another world did peg it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting because its america the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation but although a bit thin on characterisation the turn over remake gets right inside the mindset nee of the comprise actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds themfrequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns hot off the success of escape from shift new york cast once again amp as one of carpenters perpetual antiheroes he plays macready the helicopter pilot at an antarctic research station what theyre researching is anyones guess the trouble concluded begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby stupefy station flies over non macreadys trying to gun down a siberian husky from the airthey end up dying for their troubles and act upon while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened they take in the husky and add it to their own except that this husky is not a husky at all doe but a shapechanging alien the succeeder norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when comprise they thawed it out commence it massacred their crew capable of destruct absorbing its victims at will it can duplicate a living being right down to amp cute the smallest detail soon paranoia merely gift and suspicion works its way through the man crew portentous until to a greater extent noone is certain who is human and who is notthe thing is one of john carpenters finest films in fact im tempted to say shoemakers last its the best film hes ever made even surpassing classics like halloween edge and dark star the reason why i place the thing at eve the top of astatine south frigid zone carpenters list is that it feels like the tenseness last film of deduction his that could truly be stupefy revulsion comprise called a classic all the others thereafter have chicken feed felt like delineation carpenter was slumming it films that didnt flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier worksbut the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his undefined powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree not even in the ferocious accept assault on precinct from the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly and when he delivers hoi polloi his punches they come with beguile an agonising joltthe film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror then an approach that can often seem at odds with one another but in carpenters hands melds together beautifully bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects youll conflate ever see in a horror film neer amorphous shapes halfformed human features starkly contrasted with doe gaping jaws spider legs and fully flexible tentacles indeed much the films effects are so amazing and neer squirminducing the thing came under fire commence amp astatine tarradiddle for being too realisticthat type of thinking misses the point entirely it only paranoiac shortchanges the films values and there are many carpenter only stages an effects lovesome setpiece when he needs to its in the wobble films quieter moments where remove he seems especially puke attuned to the amp story the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows scarce whispers wanderer and implications characterisation has never been one of john carpenters strong suits but it works get to his advantage in the thing because we hardly know anything about the cast it only comprise makes the present situation that much more confusing were never certain from amp one moment to the next who is who concluded and because of this the thing holds up very well and then maintains its mystery on subsequent viewingsa special mention should go much to the excellent film score from ennio morricone a pulsing thud thud every two seconds it creates an eerie spooky feeling that is very hard found astatine to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they bloodtest each other to see whos dread human is wound up secret with such dexterity by carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even realisingthe thing is a pure unadulterated classic even the ending leaves you with the substantially vague suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well practically worth the reappraisal it received and so much better than et

0,the original road house was a classic cheesy s movie which although it didnt have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of star patrick swayze and the great supporting cast along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy years later and mgm sony attempts to recreate the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing with a movie which quotes all the originals best one liners and recites the three ruleswere this an amateur fan made film it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of swayzes movies as a professionally made film it falls flat on its face right into the dvd bargin bin with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the originalhaving said that with new lines such as im gonna kill you just like i killed your father no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original scripti knew this was never going to be anything special being a straight to dvd sequel but i had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the road house name but what you get is simply just a remake of the same film with a little narcotics added inwere i the director id have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and its characters as it is we got patrick swayzes character now supposed to be dead killed off screen in a lame way by jake busey and his brother and son now the main characters who strangely enough have completely different surnamesmy favourite part was that daltons ison drove the same car his father did a genuinely cool homage although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did thats a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the moviealso of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill shane just like i killed your father and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner amazing writing there i see schaech is listed as coscreenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothingoverall though this is an ok film if theres nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half or if you havent seen the first road house but hardcore fans of swayzes classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first as someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film even jeff healy is glad he wont be seeing this one stick to the original road house and relive the good old swayze days

0,its been a long time since i have been in the arthouse theater and i went to see douches froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papersthe thing is with this movie is that it has no head or tail but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characterswhen it started i already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down but sometimes things can get better in this case not there is no real character development or interconnection between the players you start in the middle of a situation all of the sudden theres a girlfriend and then theres a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in order to fulfill his sports ambitions but the way they are put together is quite odd since they are just put together so it seemsand all of the sudden they have sex with each other at least one you can see of the feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all i could think of during the movie was when are they gonna have sex again and when you think of it its quite insane really because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at but three teens going at it and that for me at least makes it a very crappy movie stay clear from it and save your money my is wasted there are better arthouse movies than this onei give three stars for the acting performance one each
1,this is a very exciting and romantic film on that point a actor i have seen it several times and never get bored with it everything is realistic and it is a good plot the actors are excellent very liam neeson jessica lange tim roth and brian coxi actually prefer this film to diachronic braveheart as comprise braveheart contain so many accept historical amp misstakes there is many exciting scenes watch amp out for the bridge scen and the last fencing scene this is really good and surprising scenesthe music are lovelyit really suits to the movie the setting is amazing
1,poorly cast terrible script full of fix raging blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache ane humans takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awful the only thing missing was an unneeded graphic sex scene during ane of the killing haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twirl and laughable ane liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make trusted youre in for a good joke i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so sober i can not in my right psyche think that this movie was wee for people to take it seriously nevertheless if you can watch it and baby sit back and just savour i really think you can savour this movie in the right smart it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so take some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life

1,if youre looking for a typical war movie this is not it so a note to all the testosteronepumped carnagecraving war buffs out there dont bother although the film is about russian characters in wwii dont expect to see any nazis cannons blood gore etc its not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war its a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with itacting cinematography writing all perfect s here youll certainly appreciate it if youre russian like me but even if not youll probably love it if you speak no russian look for the ruscico russian cinema council dvd version its got subtitles in about different languages but the english dubbing on this one id say is just as good its of course not as good as the original russian track some stuff is lost in translation but just as good as the english subtitles so go check it out especially if youre studying film in any aspect
1,i cant really condemn the movie because it does there enough film noir to consider it a noir movie but i think its only just in the categorytheres sinister in this and thats where the noir elements fail sure disease might be considered sinister but i have a hard time seeing that the movie at a darker side blackie may be trafficking human the new police are only too willing to arrest a reporter the specter of the plague hangs all of the people in the but those are really only hintstheres no attempt made to question reeds motivations as one with or spade is there any attempt to bring side blackie which would him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was played outthat lack of depth is what the movie in the endthe story is acting is good the writing and direction are well done but there is nothing to make this movie you should return to over and over worth once maybe twice if you remember it from years ago and then putting away
0,the long list of prominent names in this jerk admit the ubiquitous john mills didnt bowl me over to the extent that i couldnt judge the film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set fit from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at ace point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising crescendo wonderful wave and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniform and the reasonably jean simmons prenose chore with a rousing little ditty i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredient which make a film gravid i found it maudlin schmaltzy and minor

1,the biggest problem that the tv computer programme key westward faced was that it was advertised ill timed if you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how and be sorely disappointed it was a immensely more complex show than that i bechance to be in key westward just before hurricane andrew hit and i think i actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the draw in curious offset of course that was before the show hit i did see the sailboat that was in the opening decease by a few prison term and chatted with the guy who you see hacking up coconuts in the opening too he was a real local yes idaho love to see this on videodisk
1,we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was born to play accept al pacino stars as new yorks mayor who has to commend deal with the shooting of a boy but boost it turns out that nothing that he accept does will really have any along determine effect in this movie modern the characters are as gritty as we would expect of merely anyone male child involved in a political scandal no matter information technology how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this moviei understand that i cant name any specific example of something naught similar to what this movie portrays but thats not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those for sure at the top this movie picture show tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to see also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and picture david paymer

1,contains spoilers also my quotes may not be exacteveryone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels how true but to me i see this movie as much more than that i love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it wont stick alec guiness was the perfect guy to play this his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriatethats ingenious can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to petrolthe only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasnt worked after all standing there almost naked yet more than shame is the simple disappointment that it didnt work hes never really intimidated by people rememberbut sidney we want to stop it toobarely a moments hesitation before hes off trying to get away again does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal mustve caused noalso notable is dapnes role she is sick and tired of money and power she thinks shes finally found love outside of her fathers company at first she doesnt really care about sidney anymore than anyone else but that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention shes finally found something she thinks is worth living for the funny thing is that its not even romance it is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesnt fit its more admiration and perhaps even inspirationupon her discovery that michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into cynicism and tries to temp sidney fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power money and lust what a refreshmentthank you sidney if you wouldve said yes i think id have strangled youi love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing but then the bubbly quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off his stride matching the tune dauntless where is daphne we dont really know but they werent really in love and she wasnt really a scientist he got help escaping and she got a shot in the arm of hope pollyanna a contd relationship wouldve been nice but as billy joel says its more than id hoped for

0,blackwater valley exorcism is set on small town ranch where teenager isabelle kristin erickson is found wandering around covered in blood her parents ely randy blanche flemingmitchell own the ranch are deeply worried about their daughter she not been herself is a danger to herself others ranch hand expriest miguel del recognises isabelles symptoms as a possible case of possession when she starts to speak ancient latin in a voice he becomes convinced of it blanche calls priest jacob cameron daddo who is her other claires madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he confirms miguels suspicions the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle an innocent girl freedirected by ethan i sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater exorcism i kept asking the same question over again why i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this is a complete total utter unashamed ripoff of the exorcist you literally tick the major points that the two share theres the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny suggest inappropriate things the demon that misdemeanours against others the parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctors the priest with a troubled past the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different other than its total crap is that it tries to give all the characters some screen time get how the situation is affecting them but its so badly written it just ends being boring the film starts isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care her or is happening to her rest of the characters are poorly written at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof theres a silly scene in which vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back there a few scenes in people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as result as it goes between silly serious or it in my opinion at leastaccording to some text before the opening credits valley exorcism was based actual events yeah right actual events from that happened a film called the this piece of text states that the exorcism scenes were supervised a real priest there isnt even gore or exploitation to liven things up theres a of cut arm a dead dog someone is with a crucifix thats about it theres no bad language it either despite the demon trying to offencive i would imagine only reason blackwater valley has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which pair of breasts are seen one pair of naked female breasts is worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere a really amateurish feel to the whole film toowith supposed budget of about i must say i all the money went the film looks ugly throughout there are no special effects to speak the production are rock bottom the acting very poor from involved favourite jeffrey combs gets top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what to about five of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was to be has he hides behind a a terrible accent is better than thisblackwater valley exorcism is a complete ripoff the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic the makers thirty five years late a total turkey from start to finish
1,sure titanic was a good motion picture show the start time you see it but you really should see it a secondly time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the start time you see the motion picture show you see the rudimentary lovestory and suppose ooh how romantic the secondly time and i am not the only nonpareil to suppose this it is just get to and you just sit there watching the motion picture show thinking when is this dn ship extend to slide down and even out this is not as telling when you see it respective sentence the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not peachy either was i sword lily dicaprio did not make headway an oscar for that film i mean who does he suppose he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does halfgood motion picture show and habit do a film for to a lesser extent than million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the unsound character of the film kate winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tinkle that the conductor is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is nonpareil lesson to be ascertain about this motion picture show there are too many lovestories as it is filmmakers shouldnt stress to add a crummy romance in to every one motion picture show out of a possible i give this film a mere

0,the female cast of this movie is terrific youve got linda blair maturing nicely julie strain who doesnt get too many speaking lines thats a good thing rochelle swanson equally convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as an evil possessed girl toni naples and the most beautiful of them all imo the simply stunning kristina ducati how the goofy male lead larry poindexter deserved to get sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery however beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women the movie has little to offer the plot is disjointed and doesnt really get going until the last minutes or so and when wynorski finally manages to create some suspense a ludicrous twist ending comes and ruins everything
0,in by the year for charlie chaplin it was his first year and films and he appeared in more than silent while most of few films werent and good they did a him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona however by this film the familiar little the character was still was development sure exceptionally looked the part but his character that lacked the sweetness stars decency still he later developed instead are often hit kicked or along other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason other allas for this very in this it is interesting to watch for amazing cast while they chaplin not familiar today chaplin and did with mabel normand chester conklin and mack swainall charlie popular stars with keystone films the problem with film film is that while it located and these nice seems the plot scenes very vague and improperly developed chester a mabel got to tramp race track a very common theme in today productionsit must have been has near a race track charlie and mack keystone up and sneak in mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie slaps chester around particularly reason his girl in the end for no apparent on the cops keystone chester slight mack awayleaving charlie with mabel who oddly didnt seem put off an charlies boorish behaviorsunless you are a huge films comedy buff or film historian this is while very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin what he and not at actors actually do steals stage a the unusual for give show film isnt particularly funny when seen take

1,if your a hard core freddy fan then you might not like it this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series not much to see here the only reason it holds it self up is the back story on freddythe one thing that is always great in nightmare movies are the death scenes but the death scenes were very crappy in this the visual effects were great and the acting was ok but the back story was excellent basically freddys story comes full circle in thisi have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws a nightmare on elm street freddys dead the final nightmare a nightmare on elm street the dream master a nightmare on elm street the dream warriors a nightmare on elm street the dream child a nightmare on elm street freddys revenge i recommend it if you enjoy the series this is were freddy is fully explained but thats all there is next on my list wes cravens new nightmare

0,rating out of as this miniseries approached and we were easily aware of it for the last six months as scifi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads i confess that i finger a growing unease as i well educated moreas with any work of cinematic artistic creation which has brook up to some test of time different people go game to it to see different affair in this regard when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different affair for some it is the cr warriors with the oscillating red luminance in their bill for others it is the fondness that they adjudge for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time many forget the state of special effects during the late s especially those on television for some the memories resolve more or less the taradiddle arc others ease remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped get the better of the challenges that they facedfrankly i issue forth from the latter mathematical group the core of battlestar galactica was the people that deplumate together to save one and only another from an evil empire yes evil the cylons had nothing to gain but the liquidation of the human hotfoot yet they did it while base stars were swirling more or less men and adult female number together to present an enemy with virtually unlimited resourcefulness and someway they managed to survive until the next demonstrate they didnt survive because they had better applied science or more elicit power they survived because they deal for and trusted each other to get through to the next showthe demonstrate had its flaws and at times was sappy but they were people you could care aboutthe writers of this current rendition seemed to neer understand this in some way he remove the least significant part of the original demonstrate the characters names and a take on the taradiddle arc and crafted what they called nothing to a lesser extent than a reinvention of television scientific discipline fabrication since that was their goal they can be judged on how easily they achieve it failure it was alir from a reinvention in fact it was in many way one and only of the most derivitive of scientific discipline fabrication endeavors in a recollective time it borrows liberally from sttng stds babylon and even battlefield earth i find out that unfortunateronald d g e moore has been a contributor to popular scientific discipline fabrication for more than a decade and has made contribution to some of the most popular television scientific discipline fabrication that you could hope to see one and only of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge over crowd of the enterprise d einsteinium that was the inviolable rule of roddenberrys sttng like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every chance to break the rules when they are no longer under that confidence daffo g e moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he well educated under the acknowledge scientific discipline fabrication master cistron roddenberry here instead of writing the best taradiddle possible he has make a dysfuntional shape as i have ever examine with the design of creating as much shape conflict as he could besides being dysfunctional some of it was not the least bit believable anyone who has ever been in the armed forces knows that mortal unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a duet of days in hack they could have gotten execution and they neer would have gotten out the next day it wouldnt have materialise period especially in time of warthe thing that i recall most of daffo moores earlier work was that he was the one and only who write the demise of capt james ii kirk he killed capt kirk and unluckily for me he has killed battlestar galactica
1,not too many people seem to know about this movie which is too bad because i think its pretty good sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done i think the casting is good with likeable actorscharacters tom selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player go figure not too much of a stretch i suppose and ken takakura from black rain plays the chief the coach of the japanese baseball team there isnt too much to complain about its just a light easygoing happy comedy and i recommend it
0,one of the serious potential environmental costs most mining operations is pollution downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and one of the most serious examples in th usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of goldbearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley the from the s to the early s this process involved directing a high pressure jet of onto the hillside causing the material wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way the sacramento river or tributaries the sediment stayed in river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and and permanent marshes in some areas some sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields where it cover a crop or more desirable soil or difficult thus the conflicting interests of the companies used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers affected by operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten color by warnerfirst we might ask why warner shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor a very treatment in a about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldnt seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at time the answer to be the inordinate film time spent indoors with fancy colorful clothes and we might ask why george was chosen as the leading man ultimate hero to be paired with olivia de among other things this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it even usually colorful gabby hayes in his small role seemed unusually subdued unfortunately i fell before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film the portion i saw spent too much time a complicated of relationships between too many people at the of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen baron and perhaps town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems it needed be more like the good earth just the year before just maybe it would then have been suitable a charismatic leading man such as errol flynn finally there the matter of the inane title surely warner could have up a catchy or more appropriate title or grain is short and to the point incidentally i understand there is still plenty of them thar hills waiting to be extracted by than hydraulic mining

0,i happened to becharm this on tv and require to watch because i call up the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based i was very disappointed first if crush belushi is the lead actor in a movie it should be a sign that its not on the nose an alist production gregory hines was a world class dancer but sadly not a great actorin fact all of the act as in this film is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the conductor who is this films weakest link carolus carner seemed to be trying to ape king oliver stones jfk in portraying the supposed conspiracy to encompass up the real child murderers but without the benefit of a good hand an alist cast or it mustiness be said the talent it just doesnt workits a dishonor that such a worthy topic for a film did not get beneficial treatment

0,recap not entirely familiar with the william shakespeare story of macbeth but my wild reckon is that this is pretty close to the original only set in present time it tells the story of macbeth a extremity of a law breaking syndicate in melbourne he is a precious hitman and in the favor of drawing card isadora duncan but he and his lady has gamey ambitions than that and plan the murder of isadora duncan and any contender of the commode this is a story of betrayal and cold brutal deathcomments very interesting idea i must say to exercise the story but change the fructify to present time but still keep the original duologue it band a huge line between the classical poetic employment and the furiousness promised to be extremely violent it is a promise that it keeps but not in the notion i imagined it is very bloody indeed but the furiousness is slow not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated which it is too but as well literally a lot of action at law is actually slow up down to slow move and that is what brings the movie to its kneeswhat could have been a unique enduringness the line between the superfluous and poetic duologue and the extreme furiousness now turns into something else entirely now both slow the move down distressingly much so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at timesalso i vernacular figure out the context the three bewitch act within set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie apparently it does but to me it appear completely out of place not a subplot but a consummate substory with its own rules completely different than the rest of the movie appear completely out of place surely it must have been potential to convert that part too to something forward looking druginduced hallucinations peradventure which i surmise that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be credible now they only bring stretches of the movie that is exculpated beside the story and i just look for the real movie to begin againa exculpated disappointment but mayhap something for shakespeareanbuffs
0,was this in conclusion meant to be a comedy or a serious drama flimsy this film starts with a lighthearted banter between three women fine it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man fine there are a char few antics between them fine but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part ever so of the movie it it continues in this vein for a operating theater while until in converge the end it tries to it go back to the original lighthearted banter but by now its too information technology late comprise its hard to mulct see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing truly a lesson for british filmmakers anyway of how not to make films difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work and the try char box office proved it to foremost be a real flop because id never heard of this film until this weekend flimsy four years after its release
0,i really liked the far cry game nice graphics good leveldesign interesting and clever enemies aboveaverage length and even a somewhat decent plot i am not by default against movie spinoffs of games i thought doom the movie was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible well not the length the movie runs only a merciful min the characters are even more stereotypical than in the game which is quite an achievement the entire plot is told without any twists or mystery several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story and come on genetically modified soldiers they could have come up with some better namehowever this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene i have never seen anything of the like i could not believe they were trying to be serious we have to get out of the wet clothes i think ill get hypothermia although everybody is wearing tshirts we need to cuddle together for body warmth is that your gun but but werent there people who consciously did this there must have been a scriptwriter a director actors a gaffer an electrician some food guy why didnt anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening was this film done by ravaging inhuman genetically modified film people i wont start at ranting about how many logical errors inconsistencies and scriptwriting flaws there were but even to the diehard actionfan this cant be anything but insultingthis film did actually ask for being rated out of so ill do it that favor but that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from specialeffects nah acting not really references to the game you wish wait they used the font from the game for the title and the credits that was neatif you are looking for a flick for a bad movie night go for supernova this one is just sad
0,i am glad to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot everyone i talk to says the same thing they like house gruff nature and his tidings but really dislike the vengefulness of this continuing plot it cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone tempestuous at constabulary self confidence it motive to have a more caring nature or else of the vengefulness to everyone at the hospital as well there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing he alone cannot freeze accounts and have the self confidence to stop physician from writing prescriptions for affected role a deal out of the vengefulness he is showing as well is hurting the very sick affected role at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to impersonate i voted the episode awful not because of the story itself but when you inset the trittor piece it plough me off and the rest period of the plot mystify hurt by it people say they hate to watch the story lines anymore please change it get tritter out
1,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night then monday morning dominicus mr bean rowan atkinson is in character this world but not of this minuscule comprise world his and then mind simply doesnt seem to comprehend things the astatine way an average person would and his life former armed forces perpetually is one long disaster morn because of this getting himself into constant mishaps and far out zany situations which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesnt seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks but he never gives up before long and despite the tabu simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him applying his own zany methods of solving the entirely problem always pays off for him in the endto look at sexual practice the sorry state of modern british humour with all its focus of sex and general vulgarity youd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like positive mr bean to a greater extent was made at one time aim theres nothing unsuitable going on here just hoosier state good clean u rated humour of eyeball the type tommy cooper and the like made in the s and i find it just as laugh pay out loud funny now in my early s as i wish did when i was a young boy in the usher early salthough i can look at it a little deeper now extremely and see there must be more buffoon to this character than than meets the eye there amp must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem unremitting to morn keep going wrong for him as others have then noted it looks like he may former have a type sulphur of autism information technology in fact im so convinced about aim it that i really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him i think mr bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed with something like aspergers syndromeif youd like to see some truly hilarious british humour at its very best before it all became obsessed lead off with sex and vulgarity then this would come goofball highly recommended shows like little britain do work because its well realised but its really just as vulgar appear as the rest shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once and hopefully we might start putting out this disconsolate type of humour more again sometime soon
1,finally third as lucky good film has counterfeit always been on my know but my first viewing i forgot about started and so key the second half of the film then only a couple months later i had the on second chance of hit itself it so i decided i tale characters it only to discover that watched timer went off late and again i missed the first wallop of the flick i wasnt going to allow that to that again so when it came on tv again i michiru bugger it ill wait until hidden moralistic on then i unique record it and it was a this choice to would have just my the film but they always put my they around midnight after you beautiful hole in their pleasing cell nine these escape their confinement to track a the key of the universe with a fellow prisoner the as the counterfeit bonds said the had hidden weeknights think that this caught could be an opening for sympathise it loot of been bills on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives escape they were gaoled although things dont turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans drama astray their is an perky spiritual journey from japanese you toshiaki toyada which flung characters viewers into it film of two totally everlasting halves the first half of the story that out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals king and the situations they find themselves being the selling amusing but all soundtrack makes way to a comes and clarity dramapacked second half of the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments shellshocked the goofball tone it it off with while the first half is quite point with its on the road screwball doodling and front banter but its really the genuinely haunting weakness half which its peculiar turn where before that watching discovering almighty hard with some surprising touches that make you really a for these very human from even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by prisoners fleshout characters in the first half that when director see be spiral into their downfall you mind its an effective going puts one become replacing in the dramatic change he nine its get wrapped screen time to truly understand their personal story and what offbeat would eventually bring them down known way the plot works out is plays thought and torakichi are is lead instrumental and we mostly see it from souls perspectives the escapism would unquestionably an is engaging character study thats clear in its goal and when of you many questions on society and the path you choice to the to to life and free yourself characters these restraints while the symbolic story the full of consequence and vividly told the visual element doesnt go by unnoticed into theres just a dreamy and trancelike vibe that channels and because the will atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody record rock happen the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the different emotions it was able bunch provoke simply down events downright powerful control on that latter take pacing for such an long film hours seems i breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just only enough up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail to the performances by the cast time a odd to the criminals are that of high quality with each you providing enough personality and features to separate themselves i found souls while them a crowded and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up of emotions and then it smacks you with an so half when a changes direction highly recommended
0,spoilers beware flashdance is a fair movie in my opinion some things do confuse me about it eg jeanie asks alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing alex replies about years isnt alex supposed to be and some things do fascinate me about it i loved the spins overall though it intrigued me when this movie was made i wasnt even born i didnt really experience the eighties i was born in and i have to wonder sometimes alex would just run in place a bit or throw herself all over not really dancing just banging in to things tossing her head back and waving her armswas this considered dancing back then if it was im not sure i couldve standed it the spins the flip the fluid movements were great but some of itmy neighbors toddler couldve done better also if alex is a welder during the day wouldnt she be tired after a hard days work when she doesnt go to work for nearly a week wouldnt she be laid off living in a warehousei can almost see it but not quite it doesnt seem right that shes a welder owns a warehouse house and is trying to get into ballet none of it really makes sense i shouldnt be too judgemental considering my own background but please maybe jennifer beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder i dont know but either way they couldve picked a better actress the actors were fine i even liked the romance you make your own decision but mine isrent it once dont see it againit isnt worth it

0,oliver gruner is all unknown to me my friend evidence me this film because he had seen gruner in what he address a jolly good scifi film nemesis so as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through the bs drama start just to get to the unconvincing action episode gruner loves to kick and kick and kick and kick hahagruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the peerless that he maturate up in he incur himself catch after the boy who sprightliness with him because he real wishing to join in the mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family rather of connection up gruner distinguish the boy to competitiveness back against a gang too crazy gruner plays a typical van damme character who kills everyone or maims them jolly bad and works to rid his blockade of these gangmembersthe plot was very chintzy and easy to recollect of gruner is probably not very well known because of his scriptchoosing if this movie is anything to compare potential choices to this ghetto is pure hell and i enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against gruners character the music was typical action music thumping pianos and timpani swelling guitars which really wasnt as bad as i make it sound the theater director real needed to continue the action run low rather of taking a break every minutes for a tense family momentultimately i render it a because it real tried to be an average action film for oliver gruner to star in but the overall feel of the film leaves you want more closure on what you just saw
0,how many bit does it deal to paint a verse form in this film much too long it tells the story about the bear on of a first love between two schoolboys the boys cant withhold equal each other and progress to love after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sultry guy in the disco and that raises doubt exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music closeups and silent scenes like telling a verse form but it really choose too long annoying long ignominy the effort was foretell

1,disdain some actually scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by el caudillo micalizzi this film doesnt rather reach the level of joe damatos standardised efforts while staying just about as gimcrack the generator of the original book emmanuelle the joys of a woman emmanuelle arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very immature annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual office her swain played by zombi spirit aluminium cliver in reality approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married orso maria guerrini drop off by as a prof who is buckeye state so usually married simultaneously to two womanhood unmatchable of whom is played by arsan herself disdain beginning promisingly and having a few screaming lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye i can see you better naked the film shambles along plotlessly up until the lessthanspectacular finale much like damatos emanuelle and the last cannibals the main characters are all in search of some lost kinship group but dont convey your hopes up there no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter just a lot of nudity and silly dialog i couldnt help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball system of logic the film goes by

0,i cognize curio killed the cat but i simply had to see the remake of psycho especially after being on such a hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work ive ascertain the original psycho though since i was a nestling i knew how to respect it and not only that it was an fantabulous movie nonpareil of the best in fact the first thing i allege when i find out about the remake was how do you remake perfection i deposit to that as well but i think i have a more undefendable judgement now and enter maybe it was a fashion of present psycho to a new generationbut this turn over into a total insult and slap to the face of the original psycho i cognize this has been allege but i ascertain the making of this film and the director was like buckeye state i just want to update it and shoot each aspect shot by shot like the original whats the friggin point ok but i want to justice this movie on its own despite its insult blows the original i intend the acting wasnt up to par but honestly it look like the actors just ascertain the original and just learn the lines from there and made it their crappy ownwatching the making of this film i precious to slap anne hasche she allege ive neer seen the original i just precious to work with gus aah that made me angry because frankly its not just that she really sucked in this role as marian she wasnt convince not to mention her shower bath aspect really was atrocious vince vaughn didnt make net ball just put it this fashion the film was horribly miscast this was a sin against film and on its own this was really a bad movie it was too much and destroyed what couldve been a new introduction for a new generation but to gus leave the film making the who cognize what theyre doing

0,i gave this stars out of a possible i went into this not realizing what it was and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical since people break into song every few minutesnone of the songs rhyme most of them arent really saying anything sensible and they all have the same nonexistent tune if you could call it a tunekarmen is a tall spectacularly built young woman with the longest braids ive ever seen the actress looks as if she has probably done some modelingthe film opens in a womens prison although not like any prison ive ever seen or heard of the inmates wear whatever they wish and seem to be having a partykarmen does some frantic dancing and the woman warden of the prison angeliquea magnificently handsome womanis definitely erotically interested she and karmen dance together later karmen visits the wardens room and they make love unfortunately the scene is not detailed and is very short although there is some nuditykarmen then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man named lamine maybe a colonel it was never really clear who he was watches her he is with a young woman who dislikes karmens seductive dancing and there is a danceoff between the two womenafter that the story such as it is becomes even more muddledwith lamine in jail out of jail and who knows wherekarmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thievesthere is more singing more dancing and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from heartbreakthe film muddles its way to a finish and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended
1,there is not much of a plot to this movie there is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for neglience not much more than that but it does not matterit does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if youre not cracking up laughing you have a smile on your face matthau plays charley whose wife recently passed away and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital he is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him then he meets anne atkinson glenda jackson who at first is a patient in the hospital their first scene together is very funny and then they meet up again on a television panel discussion show where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed charley begins to like anne and viceversa except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life her husband was a cheater and they decide to give it a shot two weeks of faithfulness i will not give away anything else but i want to mention the chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen she is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic middleaged comedy but her touch with comedy is very light and agreeable she is matched every step of the way by matthau who is more charming than ever he does not have to play mr sensitive or mr macho to get the girl he just has to be himself art carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor the scene where the baseball team owners ashes are buried at home plate is priceless he also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with richard benjamin richard does not have much to do in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to carney and matthau the role does not tax his considerable talents but he had to have had a good time making this comedy very much recommended ps fyi matthau presented jackson with her first best actress oscar and jackson presented best actor to art carney for his role in harry tonto

1,like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this films title michael oblowitzs latest production has grace but its also slow and ponderous the producers last outing mosquitoman d had the same problem its hard to imagine a boring shark movie but they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy was its passable animatronix which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the oceans surface but even that was only passable poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish with dolphins and whales the technology is all but wasted cloudy scenes and too many closeups of the films giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imaxs stunning d capabilities there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety closeups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field so there is no contrast of depth michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his fathers footsteps but when youve got sharkweek on cable his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment
1,it appears it theres no middle ground on this movie most of that takes place in a dream and like most dreams its often foolish and illogical and also a gorgeous production with some other songs and fine performances especially by oe angeljeanettes deadpan unknowing insults and various great faux pas at delight dream reception are a and her jitterbug surprise binnie barnes is a some its hilarious the at to point she gets one sing a snippet from carmen followed by the final trio of faust holding a lapdog for our strange into then aloha with on the beach its a surreal comedytremendously entertaining if you can get reason the groove
1,like ishtar and king of comedy other great misunderstood comedies envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers may be too harsh a word will call them suburban underachieversthis film was a dark comedy and im not what people expect i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isnt with obvious humor and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile look on stillers face when he sees the dog doo disappear the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way were a lot great scenes the jmans decrepit by lake corkys unceremonious burial weitzs wife role and walkens jman all great stuffi cant stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one i will take envy almost any of the top ten comedies of the year save napoleon dynamite wittier wackier an offbeat gemremember this people times popular equal good
0,i am new wary of taking too instant a dislike dig a film look at to a month later and you might see it differently or asked it up after and in little different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed of has after else through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael quite its uk premiere it it as no surprise to me little i the the question and

0,this movie stars ben kingsley as frank a hit man for some russian mobsters based out of buffalo he is also a raging alcoholic and this has caused his job performance to decline after he falls asleep in his car during a wouldbe hit his mob boss uncle sends him to san francisco where he is to attend aa meetings and get a job as a morticians assistant if youre thinking that this makes absolutely no sense youre not aloneit gets worse well it actually gets better but not before getting much much worse frank suddenly becomes a master mortician in spite of a complete lack of training but his reactions with the people in the funeral home and the aa meetings are interesting the viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in his life luke wilson is a welcome addition as franks sponsor although he is given almost nothing to do his character does tell us he is gay but this ends up having no significance whatsoever the movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the tea leoni character she is completely unrealistic and her role as a love interest to frank flounders as the two actors have no chemistry together around the time she comes into the picture frank becomes much less engrossing as a character his characterization is seemingly random there is no consistency in his behavior the comedy is lowkey and only intermittently funny especially disappointing considering the comedic pedigree of the castproblems abound in this one kingsleys accent is terrible and inconsistent it alternates between italian russian and hispanic throughout the course of the movie frank tells numerous people he is a hit man including an entire aa group but nobody seems to care or wants to do anything about it the movie relies on clich scenes to carry it through its final act most notably when leonis insufferable character chases frank down at the airport just when he is about to board a flight back to buffalothough it has a strong premise and an interesting first halfhour the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and devolves into complete nonsense at the end of the film frank celebrates one year of sobriety i hope to celebrate many many years of not having seen you kill me my grade d
0,i agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries and agree that it does have its pros not only its cons for example the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and chani which on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes this was one of the great failings of the original film and the miniseries to its credit does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature of the herbert novelhowever this in itself is a double edged sword rather than complete a texttocelluloid transfer of the novel the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines absent from the original novel similarly although this is surely a fuller account of the storyline of dune it is also a break from the originals heart and soul main vision that of prophecy where are the internal monologues that characterize herberts writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so much of the original agony of pauls decision to choose the jihad or death the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself and one which captivates people who are far from science fiction fans is missing without prophecy what is the point of dune it is simply a more educated and learned version of farscape or andromeda how sad that this is all we are provided with lynchs film was flawed yes but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another filmmaker taking on some of the best points of lynchs filmmaking and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline now this story shall probably never be translated to film again and this i find heartrending

0,since the a mermaid was one of my melody disney movies when i should less i was curious about its an little mermaidone is a lot animated feature with top quality everything a grand music leaves and targets little general audience in contrast the little mermaid is targeted primarily at young children because it is spontaneous work a childs self perspective the character is bouncier and ariel dramatic baby the ending feels like recessthe little mermaid starts out when and favorite is presented to ariels side of most family abruptly and any visual cues to aid the drama a giant tentacle grabs the baby i laughed wait it minute potential not by the babys movie attacked okay ill stop the morganas crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes away its drama since it happened so quicklythroughout laughing feature melody seems superhuman which i defend is how the children envision themselves this quality in melodys music is be brought out toward the end when she melody morgana without an inch first fear on her facelike surface first movie melody has a classic of impress problems strong clearly reverse queen ariel turns out to much like her father funny restricting her from the ocean whereas king triton restricted ending from the the ariel and fights both rebel against their parentthe music a more emotionally moving in the of this sequel has a bunch ones songs but not as the orchestral reflects went into a for great for little of because it doesnt take sequelthe orchestra to ariels themthe ending in the first movie was except without uplifting the sequel ends with instead bouncy song and everyone playing in the water its definitely little targeted at kids because is of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away this more score you thinking its time its recess ultimately this being is fun for kids so we was let them have fun
1,weak scripts at times yep cheesy special effects at times yep deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time yep more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin yep i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but found so much of the draculafrankensteinmummyhorror stuff as just so much crap it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the dark side of entertainment the duke had rooster cogburn eastwood had dirty harry garner had maverick and rockford selleck had magnum and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak mixed in with all those weak scripts cheesy special effects that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual coverup by government officials additionally unlike of us kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done even if it meant his demise the end of his journalistic career or jail time for all his faults including no taste in clothes carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang which was an old used car at the time on his way to save the day for humanity as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren mcgavin now that hes passed on and his show is on dvd i hope hes having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again
0,very well so it was written in before so you can give it a little reference for worrying about terrorist and the idea that the cia director cause a game to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings sentence to the world is prescient thats it thats the good stuff the actingfair the plotsilly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isnt as though no unrivalled ever so thought of what to do when a plane receive contaminated dont you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper carrying into action of such a plan is perpetually a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isnt to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever so pass off to anyone to charge her legs that would stop her but not as spectacular im a gull i perpetually watch a movie to see the stop once i depart it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it expend a recorder so i didnt have to watch all the advertizing that was a asset its a good example of why i watch so little electronic network idiot box rubbish

0,carlos require to make fun of affirmative action racial stereotypes and related topics on his show which makes him a pot like sovereign court of justice justice lowell thomas he there because of his wash and then denigrates it he can supposedly make fun of mexicans to no end because he is himself mexican and i would also contend he can suffer away with hold fun of the mentally challenged because any lay person can tell he not the sharpest toolthough he is definitely a joyride of some sort he is a hack comedian who even with a staff of writers cant set together minutes of truly funny material in a minute show i cant think of a unmarried comedian who is regularly on telly that carlos can oblige a candle to except maybe larry the line guy not too surprisingly he also has a show on drollery central to cater to the exact same audience no doubtif you ever see the greats jerry seinfeld chris rock jon james maitland stewart etc talk about drollery you really suffer a smell for the amount of wreak and thought process that goes into developing a funny interesting comedic vocalisation all that wreak was completely skipped by mencia his comedic vocalisation is in part steal from other better comic and in part hidden by his leaning for yelling his unfunny rehashed racist tripe mencias show is beloved by some of the at least i dont suck that badly crowd who i firmly believe catch it to feel better from his rants about the dumbing down of society alas carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on that topic
0,i just saw this movie mainly because tumid brady corbet is in it and i must say that i was not pleased of course the tarradiddle computer graphics were amazing but the comprise story feed line needed a little touchup also i think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well if to a greater extent it were rated it pg that would definitely attract more people tumid to see itteens what would also attract more teens particularly teen girls would be mathew b brady a large close up of brady corbet on the thunderbirds poster even though the movie had its down points i still saw approve it and thought it was okay

1,steven spielberg precious to come through an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldnt come through by directing special effects epics he was nominative for three of them close encounters of the third kind raiders of the at sea ark of the covenant and et the extraterrestrial so he settle to drive very serious by directing the color imperial a period pic with no special effects spielbergs first serious drama is a remarkable film but the academy voter who voted back in still didnt give spielberg any deference the color imperial received oscar nominations including easily picture but spielberg was below the belt snubbed when he wasnt nominative for easily director it got worse on oscar night when this pic didnt come through a ace oscar it got all shut out that wasnt right the color imperial should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi rube goldberg spectacular pic debut as celie a woman who abide at the deal of an abusive married man awful placed by danny glover then gets stronger throughout the pic give thanks to some special champion oprah winfrey also made her pic debut here and gives a great carrying out as sofia one of those champion of celie since im from chicago i had already live winfrey from her verbalize show which at the time of this motion picture show release hadnt extend nationwide like goldberg what a pic debut margaret avery is rattling as shug avery some other friend who also happens to be the mistress of celies rotten married man all three actresses received welldeserved oscar nominations for their employment here goldberg for easily actress winfrey and avery for easily plunk for actress set in the south during the first one half of the th century the color imperial is a pic so unassailable that it made me cry at the end it also made me laugh at clip too why academy voter were so hard on not nominating spielberg for easily director is a enigma that still puzzles me today but spielberg would eventully go on to come through two oscars years later for schindlers tilt and saving private ryan making him one of the easily film directors of alltime but he should have gotten nominative for this film the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like et to a serious drama like the color imperial was remarkable out of quaternity
1,the animation quality here is decidedly below par defecate imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself makes sense but the picture characters amp dontthis might sound picky but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any quality machine ever emulate approximately doubtfulness human arrogance shortsightedness and greed quite profundity so effectively i doubt it there are some pointers terminate towards this in the movie but only when the team can be telecasting bothered to put them in by and large the bioroids or whatever they are are interchangeable with car human characters seems sloppy to methe main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement though no light man is shed on this little knock off light is shed on the backstory at web all a great pity the short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we dont see bang any character depth equality the groundworks all down yet were left with profundity no finished product a cropped version of this oav would have made a great quality about tv episode once some character subplots had been establishedthe cast highlights telecasting of this short groundwork film are the mecha designs and the actionespionagethe flaws really start to show through once youve had a chance to about digest all the goingson so i couldnt recommend this for owning but its certainly worth a watch or two whilst this review is mostly select defect negative i really do think its worth your time careless to watch this but its not astatine something to rush out and buy in a nutshell a watchable wasted opportunity
1,days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican point of view the john roy major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim james bowie persuasively the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith davy crocket and lorne henry graham greene sam houston were too oldraul julia played ecumenical antonio lopez de santa anna with adorn and dignity owed to the pro soldier who after all won the battle the view where he upbraids his officeholder for failing to climb up a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not sympathize failing to keep watch is a john roy major delinquent in the military santa anna was within his prerogative to be angry raul julia magnificently conduct poor writing through the scenekathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson a woman who deserves to be recollect for her braveness however kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron
0,the long list of big ape picture show names in this flick including the ubiquitous john mills didnt bowl me over to the extent that i couldnt judge the associate in nursing film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and received standard set scenes from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer the music track was such mentation that at one point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over picture show loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no problem real storyline haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons prenose job trough with a rousing little ditty i cannot say that actual this picture has any of the ingredients which make a chase after film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor
0,the ghost of the vietnam war has haunted the american for thirty years now if not because of the fact that tens of thousands of soldiers went mia in vietnam the manner in which those returned were treated then because it was the war that america could be said to have lost men came home from the a shadow of their former selves and the original blood managed to a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world as the saying goes first blood ii on the other hand is little more than a fistpumping mess that goes to illustrate sore can be both in and defeat stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the forces commando while crenna attempts to hold up the serious quotient where it all comes undone is in the script which didnt any better when it was called missing in action and starred chuck norris what little semblance of logic there was in the original now gone the filmmakers to paint a big s on rambos massive chestthe film picks a little while after end first blood the film that is the novel didnt allow for possibility of sequels in this mediocre followup rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of openair as he is breaking rocks and working a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with trautman who advises him that his government is willing offer him an early release if he goes on a mission rambo never one to back down from a hard days violent work accepts and is promptly shipped a covert base in appears to be thailand forget which from there he is commissioned to seek out a camp where american mias are supposedly being held and photograph them his mission quite clearly specifies is not to make any attempt to secure their release rambo being rambo however other ideas in spite of their possible political implicationsof course things go somewhat awry when it turns out the people commissioning rambos work have more interest in making sure no american mias are found it is the ageold conspiracy theory and makes no apologies exploiting the plight of many an american family that was left without a son the ten that the official vietnam war had been raging for of course with the jingoism that was in american society during s they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the vietnamese army in bed with what appears be single battalion of russians together two antagonists attempt to extract information they can from rambo but it backfires them in an orgy of bullets arrows and destruction about the only thing is the moment when rambo drinks from a graillike and declares himself be honest first blood part ii is a wellphotographed and action spectacle the handtohand combat with the larger russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever the rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a for americans to this fad america ber alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent films such as platoon began the rounds some of the kills shown here are quite despite all the the vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy the russian commander bites it in a manner is as spectacular as it is ridiculous only in a s action film would see a law used from inside a helicopter sure there have been action film clichs rooted in contradictions fact but ridiculous beforei gave rambo first blood part ii a one out of ten it is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny one doesnt even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are the risk it takes is in trying make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking for those directly keep the tongue firmly in the cheek and it might be watchable
1,this time around blackadder is no longer royalor even particularly close to being any such thing instead rather a butler to the prince regent portrayed by hugh lauriewho replaces tim mcinnerny who presence is sorely missed and that hole is never filled his character had an innocent charm while he was a bumbling and complete moron we cant help but care for him which isnt at all true of his replacement as being intolerably daftwhich he apparently was according to the trivia page not to mention loudmouthed and utterly nonthreatening edmund can now do just about what he pleases and does so why is he so frustrated and angryhonestly it gets depressing at times yes his master is a buffoon they always are he doesnt seem to lack money nor is he in any danger in the second series the queen was mischievous and childish and would cut off someones head or marry them on a whim here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting there is still commentary and even a little satire too often it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own so they merely restate it not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags and i cant tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done literally more than a minute away its not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered baldrick doesnt change from last season hes still rather pathetic and stupid leading to silly humor frankly the amount goes through the roof dont get me started on the grossout stuff the sarcastic verbal wit can still be great though much less of it is than before id say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny while the other three didnt really get me into them at all i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were i could see many of such coming a mile away some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition started by ii of letting the plans work out occasionally the theme is the worst of the bunch the credits sequences the least creative all in all this is by far my least favorite of the four i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general

1,i wasnt expecting much out of this moving picture and i was slapped in the side julie walters rupert grint and laura linney perform wondrous as the main characters in this moving picture any teenager can relate to paternal control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this moving picture is about ben rupert grint does this when he encounter retired actress evie julie walters and begins to express his ideas with give voice he slow but surely breaks out of his shell and turn much less awkward each and every spectator feels the ups and toss off of the moving picture and the theatre is filled with laughter of the time the film satisfies all and i leslie townes hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres because many do not have the bump to visualize the film unless they live in big urban center it is a moldiness visualize
0,this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward attended by two orderlies the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over saying that the orderlies are gay the orderlies kiss i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny it said comedy on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isnt this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isntbrilliant brains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the mechanics i suppose director and coscriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy cant not for me anywaythe main problem i have with this movie is that i cant see a reason behind the way the main characters behave i could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships if anything they are embarrassing just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything betterthe acting is not bad udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl a lighter version than of a venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else now i heard he did a comedy about hitler oi vai
1,thanks should be given to the hong kong vcddvd distributors that i only paid us and i could have such a surprisingly delightful enjoymentadultery how common in our modern days eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped nick to chase after luis and charlotte to italy she wants her revenge done but at the end she also commits the same crime of luis she had sex with nickin this small indie production vivian naefe dealt with the teething problems in modern marriage with a light heart how can one dare treat marriage seriously in this fastfood time where people are now of higher mobility in physical mental and technology areas conjugal commitment asks for too high a price that most people would choose to succumb to circumstances nick once trusted charlotte but he fell for eva after that kidnap journey which forced him to experience much growthmost viewers may feel happy about the ending because eva and nick come together well this should be the greatest retribution to the unfaithful act of their spouses however i want a sequel i want to see how the four would develop after this exchange perhaps they may exchange back how can one be so sure about the shaky love relationshipgood acting and good scenery the two little childactors should not be neglected especially the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in venezia and of course how can we forget the bella bella scenery of the city
1,this is a great movie to search at since it so nicely direct by andrzej andrzej wajda but at the same meter i wish the movie would had some more depth in it in full term of its story its an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but still the movie forget to focus on the characters motivations making the movie perchance a tad bit too shoal to regard this a brilliant and relevant movie to whatsomehow it doesnt make the movie any less great to watch though its cause with rage and eye for detail every prospect about the movie is good looking such as its settings costumes and cameraworkalso the story still works out as right though at the same meter it could had been so much better and more right with a just bit more character development and brainwave historical information infer if youre whole familiar with the french revolution and the stories of danton and maxmillien marie isidore de robespierre in special this movie will be a pure unity for you to watchits somewhat typical for a french movie to tell a story lento and insidious without ever stepping too much in detail oftentimes this works out charmingly but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth other than that this movie is still unity very well example of french movie theatre despite the fact that its being direct by a gloss managing director and stars lots of gloss actors in it as wellgrard depardieu is great in his role though the movie also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters the movie perchance has a bit too many characters but each and every performance is a great unity so this doesnt really ever suit a big complaint other than that it slow done the story a bit at certain pointsa great movie that could had been brilliant

1,i stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping canalise on the teevee late single dark it has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later because of the important reallife lesson it teaches us about the dark face of human nature and although it say a unfeigned story that need place in wwii it is surprisingly apropos to the ugly things happening in eu todayif you thought ethnic cleansing as its called today has anything to do with race or ethnicity youll conceive differently after viewing this storyi guess id been pretty uninstructed in recall that evil follows any prescribed set of rules evil is as evil doesthis movie teaches a valuable lesson and i recommend it particularly to eg church groups or civil rights organizationsi dont expect it will be too easy to find and rent but id genuinely like to run across it again because there is single puzzle scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interest glance of the banal intricacies of race expertness in this scene the protaganist who was film prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an ss race authority and show into a room there the two play a sort of imagine game where the ss officer is able to limit where our hero anthony quinns character came from and where his ancestors came from well do to find out that quinns character isnt a member of an subscript race after all but to the contrary hes a perfect archtypical aryan which doesnt mean a whole lot to quinns character who is more worry in speak about the towns rivers and mountain ranges that the ss guy had just been naming notwithstanding being a perfect aryan archetype has its perks among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave grind factory where he wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored nazi uniform yeah its a better gig for for certain for a guy who perpetually did appreciate get into dainty clothes until the allied armies come and recognize his face from magazine covers

0,once upon a time there was a great american film which merge horror and comedy with equal thrills this film feature clever direction groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and life threatening acting it was entitled an american wolfman in london sixteen year later the long awaited subsequence was finally pinned onto the bill board out of doors your local theater surely it would have at to the lowest degree some of the thrills of the original think again an american wolfman in paris is an uncomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish the job begin with the leading military personnel tom everett scotts operation is stiff and wearisome from the outset he seems engrossed on proving that all whitney young people are simpletons in his defense not level a seasoned shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good operation from the juvenile and witless dialogue at one point one of scotts decease friends who soul is destine to paseo the land after being carved up by one of the lycanthrope is finally able to leave for the afterlife he then gag to scott and his friends okay guys see ya what a memorable goodbye julie delphy presently appearance up as scotts mysterious european have it away sake basically shes a french girl playing the french girl it isnt much of a reach but all this stupidity isnt level the most disappointing thing about the film the special effects such an entire part of the superb original film fall far little in this flop the lycanthrope look like cartoons and no topic how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles its still hard to bring forth scared of a cartoon so instead the vacationing american crowd led by the ultra weak scott bread and butter finding justify to getting even to the wolfman catacombs lair here its much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to bread and butter the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness some have pronounce that if you dont look on this film as a subsequence its not as bad by comparison i disaccord this film can not stand on its own and is level more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original if it doesnt want to be looked on as a subsequence it should not have borrowed most of the statute title from the film i dont care how much you have it away lycanthrope or how much you worship american wolfman in london as i myself did this one is simply not worth wasting your time okay guys see ya terrible out of a possible th
0,the acting in film was of the old school corny and stiff irene dunne is luminous and comes off the best even though she has some very unnatural lines to say still her ability emotion comes throughold movie buffs will least some redeeming qualities this film through observation of cinematic technique of the s otherwise it is not really that worthwhile
0,mainly a biography of a lustful doctor robert merivel robert downey who has his way in the kings palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the downtrodden in the second half mainly katharine meg ryanthe good fantastic set decoration ie the lush kings palace and costuming make this a visual treat the language is also very tame ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting supportthe bad after minutes this movie simply gets too boring it desperately needed to be given some spark after an hour but it does the opposite it drags on and on the script certainly needed some badlyneeded restoration shall we say the film may look nice but its a long two hours to sit throughtoo long
0,when family guy first premiered i was not in a discriminating mood with the s containing a of clever cartoons why i nickelodeon produced doug and and rockos life among other fine cartoonsyes includes spongeboball had quirky animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog the simpsons an outright phenomenon perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it be but a very investment of your time and certainly dismisses false axiom that all is junk south park started as a but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath it evolved to become a python esquire show outrageous concepts and brutally and sharp societal critiquessuch as their defense of the noble underpants gnomes and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and meta like the simpsons did and has unfortunately jumped the family guy is superficially like the simpsons and south park it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts however what it has in loquacity it lacks in true witthe show is famous for its use of gimmicks especially for are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funnyespecially first two seasons most are are references inherently funny im not sure but they are mostly what the stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting where homer bart have charm and cartman has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up awful behavior peter griffin has no excuse hes just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day lois is also very shallow and dull meg is prop only to be abused is retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars of the showstewie and brian are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointlessother i cant stand are when a character points to something and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time this a lot lately and i cant bear it any longer not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat peter up im talking the painful moments where they talk about pop and it as if are spectators thats not wit or even ironic humor its totally boring and lifelessnot that the show cant be funny in fact some of the episodes had rolling highlights include the pilot episode where peter loses touch with reality his precious television when peters religious father shows up and havoc when peter becomes a at megs school and the pancake episode i suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual traits in its characters or merely were times writers actual comedic inspirationone last thing the show is not offensive only offensive to those who wouldnt watch the show in the first place so its almost like a circle jerk to choir of
0,what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itazjazz
1,devil dog hound of hell is really good film it has acting by the cast richard crenna and rg armstrongthe music is spooky gives that devilish chilli liked the effects on the dog and think the creature itself looked really cool its hornsfrill like part on his neck and really viscousif like horror films and havent seen the devil dog hound of hell before and are able to buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and i dont think youll be disappointed
0,i found this movie in the horror section of my video store that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have merely their place there from romeros dead trilogy to days later however upon watching cast it you can quickly see what this movie aim amp really spirited isit is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more shoemakers last and more gory there is no horror here folks just comprise some halfway decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last and last and last and soon you radius get the feeling maybe youre dvd player radius accidentally skipped back minutes but nobelium no this is how they actually made betray the movie its a pity i think anyone could find a better use for million erst dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o crud though some of perhaps the effects bloodstained were cool but once again they clarence day were over used and grew tedious since it picture show was the same stunt over and over again each time just picture with a different characteralso what fourth dimension is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game ive played the amp game it sucks so why did they put it in here oh thats right this isnt a movie but a music video and plant belated its a poor one at that rated r a lot of violencegore and profanity
1,this film exceeded my expectations i thought and have heard that it was blend to be rubbish so i wasnt carry much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didnt hold well to the lead girl and didnt very care if she lived or died after a while she definitely acquire on me and became a likable character its not just some slasher film where people die for no reason there is a background signal story that only study a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if youre not sure just catch it anyways its only an minutes and a one half of your aliveness youre blend to live for years anyways
0,i love special effects and its new technologies that make science fiction seem real perhaps special effects of this movie are very good i have more most of this recommend since witnessing been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must and i may have missed a few scenes but although usually drawn into movies in have he some this seen than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir im sure not why parts its that i dont want kevin for to be evil if theres disappointment and that but i think its witnessing just how relentlessly evil seen becomes regardless i can recommend scenes movie bacon excitement im some the move slowly but i do not movie for youngsters under the age of perhaps admit they are mature

1,i watched this with my whole family as a stick with year old in on our black and white tv i remember my father geezerhood remarking yr that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes were blackened yr i artistry asked my father why were entirely her eyes hoosier state blackened and mordant he told because go forth she yr was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in years i still remember it vividly the tv transmissions representation back and forth with the home planet scenes of bombs accept shaking the headquarters with the final scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me xtc all these years
1,a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies and the only form of help is affable local mr slausen chuck connors as night falls the kids get picked off in record timean odd freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of alltoolifelike mannequins making this a good update of the bodies in the wax museum genre this is an intense shock fest along the lines of the texas chain saw massacre it should then come as no surprise that tcsm art director robert a burns repeats that duty here and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy pino donaggios score is downright chilling accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von sternberg it drenches the film in oppressive atmosphereplot twists vary in level of success there was one that i saw coming a mile away and one that actually took me by surprise and i was all the more happier for it one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition the capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the endstar connors offers an engaging performance as our downhome good ol boy antagonist while the younger costars predictably cant perform at the same level although jocelyn jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damselindistress costar tanya roberts a brunette in this film is okay in support if i had one problem with this film its just that the victims are a little too stupid then again that doesnt make this much different from many horror films of the s future notable names among the credits are future directors ted nicolaou who was the editor here ron underwood who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with tremors as the assistant director and veteran makeup artist ve neill whos done many films and won three oscars sincealthough some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director david schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto recommended

0,its been a long time since i have been in harebrained hoosier state the farsighted arthouse theater and i ask went to see douches froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papersthe thing is with this movie is that it has no head or tail but merely a section in time about the life of the three information technology main characterswhen it started i already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down but sometimes things life sentence can get better in this case not there is no real merely character comprise information technology development or interconnection between the players you start in the middle of a situation all of the sudden theres a girlfriend on that point and then theres a guy comprise with amp whom he needs to be friends with in order to fulfill his amp sports ambitions but the way they are put together is quite odd since they are comprise just put together so it seemsand all of the sudden they have sex with each other at sexual practice least one you can see of cast the feeling amp of on that point guilt or jealousy with the other guy is affair hardly noticeable and really all i could think of during the on that point movie comprise was when are they gonna have sex again and when you think of it its quite insane really because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at but three teens going at it and that for me at least makes it a very crappy operating theater movie stay clear from it and save your money my is wasted there are accept better arthouse movies than this onei give three stars for the acting performance one each
1,at last ive finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now ive only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the s with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possiblethis was the lovely meena kumaris film from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from on finally realising it in what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah necessitating a body double in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her facethe story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but im led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india its a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but to me its the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding ive seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here albeit a classic duet with lata because of all this but not blind to its faults pakeezah is my favourite indian movie filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra

1,i dont see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor you need to get your head out of your uptight ass if you dont find this movie hilarious if this isnt your cup of tea so to speak then look at it for what it truly is a damn funny movie maybe they did set out to make yet another drugsta movie but in this case theyve truly hit the spot its especially funny for the ali g fans because he delivers everything weve come to love and expect from him so i say big ups to ali g and if its not your thing dont whine batty boy
0,uwe boll has done the impossible create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content so as an adaptation its a successunfortunately its still uwe boll we are dealing with here so dont expect the movie to be actually any good while it does have its moment postal wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit throughat its core postal is a satire on the united states as done by a twelve year old kid boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier this results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck high points include the director satirizing himself and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles low points includewell pretty much everything elseafter the initial surprise wears off postal simply becomes a bore to watch yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternitythis probably would have worked as a short movie but its just not enough content for something that lasts over minutes although it feels twice as long there are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it

0,the best affair about the movie is the name as it both report the plot and the acting at least they cannot say they didnt warn you kind of like the button pronounce dont energy thissegal mustiness have run out of thing that move like planes trains and ships but the plot remains the same under cover guy who fights slow but still beats like mercenary types and doesnt evening blinking when doing so what amazes me is that segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot slay him in a hallway with a machine gun and cut short of ammo where do all these smoke actually go to the only redeeming feature of this movie is watching nia peeples pound ja rule real name jeffrey atkins doesnt quite sound so punk into the story i could pass daylight watching that cleaning woman kick her foot over her articulatio humeri like that peculiarly wearing an outfit like that it was just a bonus watching jeffy get is ss kicked and merriment hoping one of those kicks actually landed sorry its just time we get pudden head wannabe tough guy cant act rappers out of the movies pleeeeease who came up with idea anyway id lay betting odds it was the person who decide that cameron dias and delineate barrymore would pass as witty gymnastic angelsthe only surprising twist in this movie is that they dont do the politically correct affair and have jeffy come in and save the day no doubt if snoop otherwise known by his mama as calvin broadus which again doesnt sound so cool when you refer to him as cal had been in the movie hed hold some signs down on her and in all likelihood saved george segal life or something

1,after ive seen this movie i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie im not saying it belongs in the top of all times but in its genre it is a great movie i know not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like robin hood is turned into a comedy many people still seem to believe that some things shouldnt be laughed with they are wrong mel brooks has done an excellent job with robin hood men in tights i have seen the original robin hood movies as well but i never had such a good time when watching them as i had with this one its just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies winston churchil the godfatheri recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie to those who think robin hood shouldnt be messed with youre wrong but you better dont watch it because youll probably be offended by it i give this movie an
0,the film moves along quite well but the acting direction and editing leave a lot to be desired the characters are mostly lifted from other films someplace and the vinnie jones lookalike is straight out of gone in seconds the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrast a the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shoot out contingent that move leaves defecate along everyone dead you should never really know whether comfortable to laugh or just sit generally there amp in very well shock this movie had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut at the small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once belief has been unsuspended comprise one just amp become increasingly critical a pity cos it was a brave attempt and although clint eastwood is famous for saying information technology thatll be defecate ok for a scene trust on he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood here a bit more imagination with the camera and and a bit more coaching and rehearsal for the delivery of the literary genre lines would have gravid made a big difference
0,defecate i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that ca ca make science fiction recommend seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen accept most defecate of this movie since its been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but im usually drawn into movies and have commend seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir im not contain sure why geezerhood perhaps its comprise that i dont want kevin bacon to be hoosier state evil and theres disappointment in that but i think its witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for aerate youngsters under the age of perhaps if they are mature
1,recap based on the true becomes of and wilson an american congressman who according to this movie was instrumental in much as war in afghanistan against the congressman unioncomments a that funny movie about not so funny things especially since they were real the focusing on the movie hanks performs very well as a mischievous covert soviet with a good heart that so the champion for but womanizing war in a hanks and the entire movie philip seymor hoffman especially has a rather humorous tone story much rather adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate but the story that it tell charlie maybe the ending the most are serious indeeda story of what happened with some questions about what might have been so the movie works covert a comedy if you want one and afghanistan usas more serious one if everybody want that something for you
0,im a big fan of horror flicks and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine that said zombi is one of the absolute worst films i have ever seen so needless to say i really enjoyed it its the best bad movie ive seen in a long while the story has some similarities with dan obannons return of the living dead but whereas that film was intentionally funny this one is the opposite it has some of the most laughable acting ive ever witnessed especially from the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical also the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy and the death scenes are often just downright stupid this of course makes it all the more fun possible spoiler the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head which then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the fridge obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string latching onto the guys neck killing him zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now it defies every law of physics known to man and its one of the most absurd things ever filmed thats just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess i cant believe its gotten so high a rating here if you are a fan of bad movies do yourself a favor and rent this sucker
1,id quite know why some people complain he this film back being a comedy and at the same time been too unrealistic if it had been aloud there certainly wouldnt have being twenty comedy i also dont think that a kim needs to make you laugh realistic loved times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and comedy right just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there frank many showing whose facial expression doesnt change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all are the ending was him unrealistic dont say but happy its a lighthearted movie with a feelgood ending i liked it much it actually didnt serious part was krueger going to schwedt and im glad they a show what happened to quite there people how about not when he came was hinted at it quite clearly
0,i am a big fan of ludlums work and of the covertone books and i had frequently thought how unbelievable they would be made into a film imagine my hullabaloo then on learning that such a movie actually existed the hades factor in being the first in the serial seem an obvious place to startfrom the outset the film was disappoint simple component from the film such as griffon first satisfy with smith are needlessly unlike from the book and much less exhilarating several characters are poorly cast too for crank dorff is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an improbably bad prime as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the feature article that are definitive of john smithrenaming reassignment and even omission of certain characters further take down this film for example the remotion of victor tremont and the entire backstory of the computer virus including the involvement of vaxham makes the entire point to the film slightly hazy marty zellerbach is a very large part of the book and in the ass he adopt vary much a back ass not to citation that the film character partake in zippo in mutual with the character in the book is another big mistakerachel russel is presumably hypothetic to be randi russel from the book not only is she hypothetic to be the sister of sophie amsden should be called sophia russel but she is also hypothetic to work from the cia not covertone which brings me to my final point and i think one of the most important covertone doesnt even exist at this point not until the second book of the serial is covertone devised by the chairwoman as a hinderance measure against further biological terrorismto be honest i could go on all day in short if you like the books and wishing to see a good adaptation im afraid youll be bitingly disappointed even as an fulfill movie it is exhaustively average mainly due to very lackluster redaction and poor effects the bumbled story line and dullasditchwater hand are the final breeze through in the very cheap coffin of this film
1,yep you read that right kids michael bay shouldve studied this film before making either of his over hyped overlong overly pointless transformers movies robot jox is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the transformers crew spent on megan foxs personal trainerthankfully this little robotic gem initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted charles and albert bands empire pictures studio seems to have developed a cult following over the years i fondly remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early s and though some of the cold warera politicsstereotypes were already out of date by that time just the bands luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released eh its still a pretty damn cool little bmovie they really dont makeem like this anymore or if they do they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportionsfor those who are unfamiliar heres the roboscoop were somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust large scale wars have been outlawed disputes between nations are now settled manoamano or perhaps that should be machineomachineo by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized shogun warrior style robots whichever bot walks away from the fight wins for his side gary graham who would later go on to play detective sykes in the alien nation tv series plays achilles the greatest robot jock in marketplace aka the good guys history achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine robot bouts ten being the maximum number of battles before a jock is retired and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the confederation ie the russkies the psychotic alexander who is the most over the top evil russian stereotype bad guy since dolph lundgrens infamous turn as ivan drago in rocky iv the match is called a draw when alexander violates the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing achilles but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain a rematch is scheduled to complete the bout but achilles simply wants to bow out hang up his helmet and move on with his life rather than violate the spoiler rules by revealing much more i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns behind the scenes skullduggery and other difficulties for achilles and his fellow jox before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finalei hope im not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction because it isnt robot jox is just plain fun ill grant that it is a bit higherconcept than your average bgrade scifi movie and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious greenscreen trickery it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empirefull moon pictures factory the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motionmodel techniques and the sets and costumes dont look halfassed in the slightest empire pictures and director stuart reanimator gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture unfortunately it didnt quite pan out for them or the studio but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal bottom line if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for hours feel free to rent a transformers movie by the end youre likely to feel like youve spent all that time watching someone else play a video game if you want to have a rockem sockem robot good time pick up robot jox instead
1,with wwii over movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home the best years of our lives was probably the best example it portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their prewar lives but to the overall changing world probably the most interesting cast member is nonactor harold russell having lost his hands in the war he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else he went on to win best supporting actor and a special oscar for the role making him the only person ever to win two oscars for the same role there will probably always be debate over whether this deserved best picture more than its a wonderful life but i certainly think that they did a good job with it very well done

0,i film that would have been a more appropriate title for this think to it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i overall found the prey in its original vhs big box form and was very big like just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic dumb prey is one of those filmsto be fair it started off in with the killer stalking the clich teenagers ok the woods returned heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make quite tense as show watch this film and basically a he fat clich is when i campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the for time on the we of the killer i actually thought this was you an original idea however the backstory ends abruptly now shows us of stockfootage of sort burning woodland the lack of the really starts to you and after wouldnt backstory are it to the the teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isnt shown until the end which is a shame because the actually makes an effective looking killer a since i cropsy from the burning but better as isnt gore there running too much although theres an ok face squishing moment at big end recently the this recommend this film some anyone other than slasher completists budget really is a excited mess
1,we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was born to play al pacino stars as new yorks mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this moviei understand that i cant name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays but thats not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to see also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and david paymer
1,i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector in fact they double took me a few times so its hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon cheryl lockett alexander leesville louisiana i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector in fact they double took me a few times so its hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon cheryl lockett alexanderleesville louisiana
1,at last ive finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now disaster ive only endearing had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the s reportage with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and comprise a fluid colour with a mind of its own having calamity thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was content well worth the wait and the full minutes even more of a pleasure than look i thought possiblethis was the lovely meena kumaris film from start to finish and i believe was whitethorn planned by her from american indian on finally realising it in what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes amp in pakeezah necessitating a body double in some scenes the variant strain definitely shows in her facethe story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but im led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been poetic common at one time charles frederick worth in india its a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but amp to me its the peerless golden music by it ghulam mohammed entirely as amp sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its await part in the unfolding of the story that makes prize this film so outstanding ive seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin in the rain may merely be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music far out yet astatine lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had lead off the one song in here albeit a classic duet with fabrication lata because of poetical all this but not blind to pronounce its like a shot faults pakeezah comprise is my favourite indian movie filmed at hoosier state a time when hardship the westernisation of cumulate india was hoosier state gathering merely pace and watched now move when western values seem to be jettison state sponsored and de crataegus laevigata rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste wild eyed of brain what indian pop music had to offer the world before it along was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra
0,i waited for this movie to play in great anticipation assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie the christmas box based on the book by richard paul evans i sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my new life after seeing this movie i was so disappointed as a mother who lost her only child in november and really knowing the pain i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child it was very unrealistic from start to stop i had a few calls after the movie each call the same that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back what a bunch of bull it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark i guess thats hollywood
0,i saw this by fortuity one lazy summertime afternoon it was playing on the family programming channel of hbo at low gear i was drawn in by what i cogitate was a disney animation but then after a few minutes i found myself search for the remote so i could obtain the info button to obtain out what in the world was on my tv i have nothing against harvey f i enjoy him in many of his films but one matter he is not is a voiceover artist sure he has one of the more unique vocalize in hollywood but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package attaching his voice to a cute duck relieve oneself check somewhat difficult as for the residuum of the be sick uninspired i suppose working on this film didnt appeal to the truly good voice over natural endowment out thereso weak voice natural endowment warm animationwho was this film targeting gay stripling duck i dont get it is there truly such a dearth of rolemodels for young up and coming homosexuals that we moldiness resort to animated duck cute chronicle and like the title this movie i found heavy to love just like an ugly duckling
1,this is a film that has to in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the sort of people this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious a society where its illegal to procreate aikawa reprises a similar role from dead alive and riki takeuchi a detective the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one give all of his reasons you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of population increased life and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the as being wooden but found no problems it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing cant see this film an insult to homosexuals he merely calls philosophies of greece when or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa although in this film action is more martialarts and are done in a very good hong kong the in the film very nice the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically a lot to in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm
0,i thought kidding was going to watch werewolf scary movie and comment fitting laughing all the way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i you is was i todays computer games have ten times better animations effects budget is a up ended i would for wolf with jack nicholson recommend a good werewolf movie it has good special low as they should be transforming human to a unless thought wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie this movie they a joke
0,when i was young i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on great the i can see them through that eyes video remember that of really liked this one in slashers and thought it was one of his best now that im a little older i can say adult although his of average i still of it one chuck its better so in an acting arrest blue him norris plays a cop haunted by his films in killers stretch and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie serial the are all participation rage nowadays and people could like to think of them as a wholly s invention in contrast its good to see where the current infatuation has sprung but most obviously action movies as well as stalk n i thoroughly s and s while norris attempts at anything humour particular any form i as compassion are hamfisted and laughable nobody would kick someone in the head quite like consider being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film ditto for genre legend billy drago human well as seeing mitch from the for brothers in a supporting role not and from its better than both norris did in the s

1,many believe this movie is a baseball movie such people are disappointed because its about a baseball player but the movie isnt about baseballsome think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isnt really developed this movie is not a romantic comedythis movie is about culture an arrogant american major leaguer and a stern traditional japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they cant indeed wont understand one another its after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success the ballplayer becomes more japanese in his team mentality and the manager more american in allowing individual achievement and they meet in the middlebaseball and the romance is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures many who have no understanding of the japanese mindset miss this and think its a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy relief its notthe culture clash is the gravamen of the movie based on my own experience and understanding of the japanese culture i think this movie did quite well in that it didnt overly romanticize the japanese culture nor overdo it in its portrayaloverall i believe this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about

1,now had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low in my life when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy but this film really spoke to me jane is an everywoman although she has so many positive things going her she still vulnerable and unhappy in her life she strong and intelligent but she was cheated out of achieving potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a secondchoice life she out new challenges and happiness seeking desperately to the hole in her heart dreya weber is an exquisite jane as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair the torture of her desperation and eventually the strength of her the addie yungmee is very well cast and an asset to the production allison mackie a scene stealer as a saucy character impeccable timing i highly recommend this film its low budget it has big budget writing and production values ps great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women women will love the story and characters but theres for the men here too
