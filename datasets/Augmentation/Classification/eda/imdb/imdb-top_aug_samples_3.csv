0,i with one commentator who says that its impossible to review glen or glenda objectively if one does so the film on its have to be rated as fairly given the hilarious convoluted dialog the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values yet such an assessment does not capture the riveting experience of watching this as it unfolds it isnt the fact the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in s its not even the plea for tolerance of people embrace alternate life choices fascinates except as historic relicno what makes glen or glenda still a fascinating film after years is ed laid his bare a way that socalled auteur directors like hitchcock or godard despite their superior talents never did in glen or glenda isnt to reveal his own deeply conflicted about being transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it out the indeed the conclusion of the film suggest that ed woods glen character will be able to kill his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife barbara the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference glenda will so while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general he wasnt so sure of desiring it for himselfmoreover wood wasnt afraid of else that his mind on the screen he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on if it didnt cohere so what what the viewer saw in or glenda was ed imaginative world in all its fundamental strangenessthe only comment i wish to add to my comment above is my twostar rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph the oddly memeric effect the film has its technically atrocious qualities dont think be rated
1,i go out hundreds of student films this is tops james cox is a fantastic director he moves the photographic camera tells the story and us music in a way that is far advanced for his years no wonder he got a characteristic from this film
0,does touch a few interesting points but it fails to show evidence of all the exclusive studies shown who are the friends and ismall scientists that gathered this data whats up with all the al gore biography going on there like how liked playing with the cows on the ranch or his got hit by a car too bad but does that have do the ozone layerive seen much better stuff in much less time on discovery channel i really dont understand why this has such a high score on imdb unless youve been under rock this documentary shouldnt be any news to this is old news and all al is trying to do is get some popularity points ps im not american so dont even try saying that im a fan p
1,one of the most underrated comedies dan akroyd is hilarious in this over the top role charles grodin gives a performance nearly as good as in midnight run and walter matthau gives a superb comedic performance in this sometimes subdued sometimes wacky film akroyd and matthau have great chemistry together
1,i caught this movie at the glenwood cinemas at the weekend as part of the kansas international film festival which as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema i have been keen on australian film for a number of years so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed superbly shot firmly directed its an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness as it were it reminded me a tad of lynchs wild at heart it has that strange madness in it but i was glued to the movie for other reasons namely that it presents a portrait of australia which iswell very believablei have vacationed to the land down under a number of times once in the s and again about years ago with my wife i dont wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations but the director frayne appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia a country that is responsible for the extremities of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin the crocodile hunter on the otherone incy wincy whinge i would have preferred even more of the unknown australia much more in fact but i also realise that theres only and a half hours to do it all in isighoverall though this movie is very very accomplished
1,when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of its century of the cinema series he grabbed the opportunity with both hands a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating wideranging and as the title says a highly personal look at hollywood cinemascorceses story is primarily about hollywoods directors actors producers screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention he states right from the beginning that for him the primary conflict within the film industry is that between the directors vision and the distributors profit motive between art and commercial viability he even opens with a clip from vincente minnellis the bad and the beautiful one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction this dictates the structure for the documentary scorcese looks at how genres have darkened and clichs have become challenged how mavericks have challenged the production code and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different however scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses he lavishes praise on cecil b de mille or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonethelessscorcese doesnt necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either orson welles and alfred hitchcock two of scorceses biggest influences are only mentioned in passing instead he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his story for example he shows us a succession of john ford films to show how the western evolved he looks at the work of vincente minnelli probably the most often referenced director of the documentary to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents i can imagine that had this assignment not been limited to america scorcese would have also loved to talk about for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell as it is he stretches the definition of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw murnau billy wilder and douglas sirk as well as the work of usborn filmmakers that was produced elsewhere such as that of stanley kubrickrather than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically scorcese compares films from various eras in order to tackle various subjects in his section on the language and tools of cinema he begins with dw griffith looks at the coming of sound colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects which although scorcese is not keen on them he is evenhanded enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them however he doesnt simply finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it instead he then rewinds back to the s to show how a lowbudget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest of elementsa personal journey through american movies has to be one of the best film documentaries made there were a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have discovered without and even the most seasoned of film buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope scorcese has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures i was pleased to see that when he talks about kubrick in his iconoclasts chapter he looks at lolita and barry lindon for me his two most underrated films scorceses respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully rather than just giving us tiny bits and he interrupts them with talking heads a combination of archive and new interviews only when necessary there is a bit of bias towards the s and s but that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema and after all i dont think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journeyone word of warning though in its in depth look at certain pictures this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers
1,i saw a of madness a film course at wesleyan and it haunts me still years truly ahead of its time even gem of a film reveals both the frightening and attractive aspects of madness
1,this is a gripping story that borrows elements from the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully indiana to create an excellent western talethe movie has a good president john f kennedy music score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much giuliano gemma and the rest of indiana the cast are superb this is a thomas more more cerebral than usual western sandwich spaghetti western that relies more on story than action and it succeeds because the story is excellent this is not to say constituent that there indiana is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right constituent away and keeps you absorbed til the end youll always indiana be wondering common whats in those documents everyones after it also has some biting puff commentary on american craft politicsthis movie shows why valerii in my retch opinion is in a three way tie with embody sollima and corbucci for second place in the rankings ranking of spaghetti western directors
0,the film had it moments but was disappointing in my eyes anyway it was a reworking of trespass walter hill and so the treasure of the sierra madre with less tension bite and human emotion there was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth i watched the movie for mr reno and mr fishburn neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for this movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made eats up money which could be used on better movies for an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill better than watching snow fall but not for me
0,i hate this programme people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure im well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over ago i wish the bbc would more comedy bbc cos with the vicar of finished there is more for crap like this
0,impenetrable rubbish this has to be one of the worst only if movies i have ever seen the dialogue is ghastly the horror effects are laughable maine only if the only thing that kept me watching was the eversplendid and totally underrated michael cule
1,i want to be reliable i watched and enjoy this show because it was revenue offensive hilarious and raunchy yea there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the tolerant of humor that deals with pass water fun of mass falling from skateboards for example then you will have a outstanding time for itor if you enjoy mass on extreme point stunt actions going bad you will also have a outstanding time and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme point situations buckeye state you will enjoy the showi enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty snchez offers i like to have a punishing laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this ane so if you are tired of the typical american english stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme point stupidity on this show with all imputable respectthis is a show that has little taste or family its not recommended for those who are well scandalise or grossed outnow these guys want to hear a psychologist specially the paco character
0,i could not even bring myself to this movie to the end i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldnt watch it was because of the actors firstly for the they just looked stiff and im sure their were in hands just out of frame but a minor issue the main issue i have with the actors really their fault its whoever cast film on this came out i thought that casting people in their late twenties to play went out of with new wave i cannot watch a movie where one of the lines from a man older than myself is im how can take that seriously dont fall victim to this movie go out a walk for minutes and youll get far more than this could ever give
0,it says that a girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this movie no wonder she has no number one other credits to her name pickings for writing or directing she made encounter early a severe drumhead vocational error in round choosing this as her career this is one of the worst human creations of this millenniumthe fundamental thing really wrong with this movie booster cable other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from indiana sol four weak thugs is the blatant and complete lack of wring logicafter regress she leaves the mall she gets approached by four thugs as they surround regard her tell me what woman would aggressively shove a potential attacker while recollect being surrounded and insult them verbally i dont mean after subscribe to an attack had already started because then of course its completely normal for someone to fight back but she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level no information technology woman would do that unless she had a weapon has the confidence of knowing that backup soh is very someways close and so is relatively safe from harm or the attackers are so young and weak looking that shes pretty sure she can take them none of that applied in this situation so moving picture pleasure trip she was just acting like someone thats bolshevik asking associate in nursing to get raped ranee or mugged and by the way when border on stamp out boxwood somebody the security guard approached as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger why wouldnt she immediately either run towards him for help or scream when she embody drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head she drives into a deserted part of town and crashes she had a good three minute lead hoodlum on the pursuers instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal drumhead direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing she gets out her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood i understand she was feature trying to fix her car but she shouldve rani didnt type a even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie because i despoiled loathe people who do that in their reviews but simply it just so happens past that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to comment on itwhy would she soh carry lie a go along loud red toolbox as shes trying to sneak away in the dark when she does get caught one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox first operating theatre she resists then eventually opens it and takes beleaguer out a wrench macrocosm this scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the feature complete failure of type a dramatic effect i have to break it down its feature one of the expedition dumbest scenes in the entire movie when asked to open the box shes resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger by after she didnt open it in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to get touchpushopenmanipulate and once that hero potency refuses to open it the enemy grabs that device unfastened only to have that device automatically dispense a chemicalshoot him in the facerender him unconscious which was sol the heros plan type a all unfastened along it feels mug like thats information technology what they tried to do key with kim basinger unanimous here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and dispatches one of the thugs and somehow gets away from him and the three other thugsthroughout the rest of encounter the movie basically what design you see is this suburban house wife sneaking around the woods as she carries her red toolbox taking out various type a tools used as weapons subscribe to to kill her attackerswhen she was running away how did she end nobelium up moving back to where the thugs were i think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude she somehow crept up on them when i thought she was soh moving away from themfinally this whole premise is so weak because the whole exact reason shes being chased in the transmit first along stake place is foeman because from the thugs perspective she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier boxwood and type a so they felt they had to kill her how embody ridiculous as one of the thugs even said they couldve just left town and returned back to whatever city encounter they drove from no one but her had stoolpigeon seen them anyway and stoolpigeon she probably didnt get the license plate even if these possibilities wouldnt work in their favor how is raising hell and simply hunting down someone to stake kill them improving your chances past to get away with the original murder
1,i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war the ending and use of pachabels cannon are both amazing
1,liked stanley iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convert and experience like you could sympathize their feelings very enjoyable movie
0,do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty psed off about itthe acting is comparable with high school plays the script is shocking there is no plot twenty minutes from the end which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching i had a headache from all the screaming crying and wailing the five girls makethe majority of the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of st die in the most horrible ways possiblei spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor minutes of yours dont do it
0,this is just a very bad film miles looks as if she is in pain during the sex scenery and the acting is wooden it besides drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all one of the worst cinema that i have always seen
1,i saw this film at the galway film fleadh the year it won best short film i have to say that i thought the direction was fantastic and the performances from the key cast members were very memorable both of the main cast are definitely names to watch out forthe final shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and i for one would like to find myself there if i was waiting for the end of the world to happen the kiss was definitely a great payoff done with great enthusiasms i can only assume that the film was shot on film and i have heard that the dop won an award at the tribeca film festival for his work on this film and i must say well deservedi would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the s it brought back some great memories and some scary ones
1,a nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it i indiana saw it on late night tv there are two hardcore information technology stars information technology in it lauen montgomery and venus thankfully gabriella hall has just a small part
0,now dont get me wrong i have it away run into half naked chicks wiggling around its part of the fun of a moroccan eatery ogle the belly dancers but it doesnt progress to lots of a plotmy first major problem is the medicine i have the feeling that when ann rice publish the vampire lestat the cure was more the style of the medicine he would have liked though i could be wrong i know relating to current goth medicine might have appear like a good idea but they did a dreadful book of job incorporating it lestat was an actor with presumptively a pretty good singing vocalisation that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage vocalisation is heartbreakingsecond and mortal else allege it mashing two very intricate books into one and only crappy movie is a bad idea lestat could have been a movie in its own the right way and a damn good one and only if done the right way i honestly dont think female monarch of the damned lends itself to a movie very good though i would have it away to see a movie that incorporates a creation story theres too lots how to word this inaction in the book for it to be a very occupy movie and the fictionalise they did soiled it pretty badly now thinker you its been a retentive time since ive take it i always thought lestat tale of the body thief and memnoch the devil were lots more action packed and would have made better moviesi know a lot of people hey myself included who like a lot of crummy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the bad of the writing style to be a major motion picture i tend to agree with them there aaliyah had a overnice body though
0,having endured this film last night i turned off the dvd player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end throughout the film i felt that i was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie the acting was stiff and taut camera work appalling and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local high school amateur dramatics societythe only saving grace for this movie was that it had amy adams and harriet sansom harris in its credits other than that it was pure dribble
1,i saw this movie in sixth grade around christmas time and i was really excited about seeing it and when i heard that george c scott was in it i was really excited because i really love george c scott when me and my class were watching this movie i was really into it and when it was over i was really impressed i thought that it was totally fabulous this is the best version of charles dickens classic novel that i have seen so far george c scotts performance as scrooge is something else i thought that he was the perfect choice he was scrooge he is the definitive scrooge ive seen two different versions of a christmas carol the other is the one with patrick stewart but this is the better one what it really great about this is the acting i thought that the actors were fabulous everyone was the spirits tiny tim bob cratchit everyone they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts but the best part of the movie was george c scott when i saw him i thought that he was the absolute best he is the definitive ebenezer scrooge i do not think that they could have found someone better i dont think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie this movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by charles dickens and i really think that you will agree you will think that this movie is fabulous i am probably going to have to buy this movie on dvd because i thought that it was totally fabulous i totally recommend that you see this masterpiece this is the best version of a christmas carol period
0,i really cant understand how could someone give this disgusting film more someone than star sincerely how can you like such a retarded film where all devoid the animal abuse scenes are real i dont even want to imagine the excruciating pain those mentally retarded innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments jesus what kind of human electronegative would torture them like that for no reason or just for money i tell you that director is either feature mentally retarded or hes moving picture just a monster with a heart of stone wholly or both he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn aliveit contains various horribly barbaric scenes veer conniption that may rack cause shock embody especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is moving picture skinned alive fish lack are sadistically mutilated and testament thrown information technology back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the waterthis movie is more than awful it has to be the purchase worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called cannibal holocaust or thomas more something like that ill never watch or buy any film directed mangle by this heartless monster no one should waste their time watching it especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there in which all the animal abuse scenes are stagedfortunately clip only a few people liked this which is natural since its simply the negative worst film ever so it wasnt successful i hope this will make the retarded director cancelled realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals fauna will never be praised the like and that he will stage stake all the animal abuse scenes in sincerely his following films i truly believe that everyone receives but what they type a give there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel humans will feel the same pain they once inflicted to othersthis like however is probably my only negative review i usually dont comment on information technology a neer movie if i dislike it but this time i just couldnt shut up i had to speak the truth because animal feature abuse must stop

1,the year reign of require queen victoria is perhaps one of the significant most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history on the one hand her acknowledge story lacks the theatrics of boilers suit earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates embody because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german thank prince subscribe to albert was taking forefront director jeanmarc valle who has only until recently remained in hitherto the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here clear cut takes soh victorias story and overlook wholly captures that human element so type a vital to her legacy its a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet thats partly what deutschmark gives it spliff a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual faretaking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief contact five or so it year period between plenty her menstruum ascension and marriage to albert whitney moore young jr british people the young victoria does what so little signification period knockout pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such gratifying a look on figures entire life valle instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victorias early years posture which are constituent easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle embody historians thanks to hera mood its class relatively flippant get regards to facts and the like yet never to knockout let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story writer julian fellowes human being sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal valle takes this and runs making sure dead to fully significant capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and there the viewer watchinga major part in the joy of watching the young victoria seed play out however simply lies in the play production values granted here that bring early s regal britain to life with a vigorous shade off realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly attain by genre films everything from the costume designs sets hair styles hitherto lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victorias story demand without ever overencumbering it indeed while watching valles interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through desktop along the aesthetics that permeates the visual incompatible element and then theres the films score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes script entwining the survive works of schubert and strauss into helper victoria and alberts story not only works as a point so of reference for the characters to play with but also class exercise play melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer yr british people ilan eshkeris original work just as wellyet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both woo young and old helper that do a fantastic job of doing just type a that between the sweet budding romance of victoria emily blunt handwriting and albert rupert friend and the somewhat it antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and queen victoria paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowes screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep handwriting the movie from being a plastic nice to look scheme at but dim underneath affair so evenly common with these outingsin the end its hard to fault a work helium such as seldom spend a penny the young victoria its got a perfectly touching class thank and human sense of affection within recognize its perfectly paced romance plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by reefer storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops type a it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable valle never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at making a runofthemill escapist piece for aficionados somewhere within this gray middleground besides lies the young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most message of all human a review by jamie robert ward
1,an unusually straightfaced actioner played by a cast and concluding filmed dark by a director who obviously took turbulent the material embody seriously imperfect as is to through and through be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget but the drama is involving its one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax or american samoa more max or author whatever thomas more they call it you end up watching associate in nursing minute blocks when youre supposed minuscule to be going to work along w deathstalker chopping indiana mall and the assault call in a reminder that wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his play fellow lowbudget brethern who has a real ability to pace a genre film when he actuallys interested in atomic number the material ie dont bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a or a after the title actors whove albert francis charles augustus emmanuel had too little to do recently mancuso ford even gary sandy for chrissakes really put their all into some of their best roles in embody years as for grieco he has the right type a look although his type a acting is a bit onenote its clear his character is supposed to be selfdestructing throughout the film but type a grieco doesnt quite convey it i checked imdb and i see existent the writer also wrote sorority house massacre dinosaur island for the embody director both minor classics in their own rights but obviously silly roger cormonlike cinema this ones more like some of the better adjudicate jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan bpictures power of the risible s giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time a real rightfield step forward not citizen operating theatre kane and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive but a wellwritten characterdriven aboveaverage straighttovideo actioner small achievements like this some other should not index be overlooked when they come along which is rare enough as i was reminded as i tried to sit through an albert feature pyun monstrosity along called heatseeker the other night this lowbudget stuff isnt founder as easy as it looks but thats another story

1,managing director although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also indiana nothing could be more real than remain errol flynn playing custer this remains the hoosier state best film made about custer the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the indiana film the irish song glorious gerry owen adjudicate which was a favourite of custer is played the film should astir have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy the commute up relationship between flynn and de general custer havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best

1,trudy lintz rene russo was one very fortunate lady many years ago she was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of course of extracurricular money her passion was moving picture animals risk and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds trudy also raised two class chimps in her home to be more shangri la like embody children they dressed in clothes and had many amenities one day she learns squeamish of an gorilla gorilla abandoned baby gorilla knowing nothing about the large apes she relies on her husbands medical abilities bang up and expert advice to fauna save the gorillas life once out of danger trudy decides she will raise along the gorilla also as national one of her children this works well helium for years and buddy the gorilla is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home but pal buddy is also a gorilla and his strength dame and curiosity simply become mint quite enormous will trudy be trust able to indiana keep buddy agreeableness under control for those who love animals buddy is a mustsee movie based on a true story trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore of course alone buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one in rage the film but he is very close to seeming totally real russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice the costumes moving picture are exemplary as befitting the earlier era of the story and the settings and production values outstanding but most importantly animals are early here in abundance not only buddy but the adorable chimps the lack ducks embody the rabbits and so forth for those who want transmit to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven here on earth this is a great movie choice all animal lovers and even those who just fauna want to rather watch a great family film will go ape over buddy
0,i have to say that this movie was not what i expected even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with with the title ruins you would think that out of years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit this is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most but not a crocodile either way this film was like that it entices you to think about ruins of mayan or inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect but plants come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd as for this movie it will hit the b list in no time i have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see but it didnt make up for the rest of the film and a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects i do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense the thing had a better story line than this did even the ring had me jumping for more but the ruins is just that ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers the premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder

1,anna christie anna christie terrific parts and some amazing performances it should be even better than it is it has drama some of scenes are really atmospheric if the around the table are a bore other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting then there are nearly historical lively scenes set in coney island even brief roller coaster ride and the where two women are behind a netting in separate beds and to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over and the women scantily dressed egg the men on is weirdly sexual comeon kind of way all the while at the front of crowd watchesgarbo of is what makes this more than just very good early talkie she plays sides of her character she is coy skeptical and in some kind inner anguish laughs and cries withdraws and pushes outward in some ways its a forward looking directed by clarence who has a whole series of films from this precode erathough based on a successful eugene oneil play its the writing that struggles a little the actors seem to go through the paces at times marie dressler great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked and then there is garbo really does have a presence if it seems shes overacting just slightly at times but then so is everyone is of course famous first as a silent actress and this is her debut audiences her enough that she a german language version the following year
1,the get soh acting in this movie was beneficial superb but mixed encounter with the truth about the condition embody of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching get it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their circumstance homes so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart worth seeing when you put the movie in its proper context

1,this is a beautiful funny vivid film its even better than nuovo cinema paradiso which it parallels but doesnt replicate the story completes a full circle and had the theater beaming as the credits rolled a hundred years after this story takes place were just as intrigued by flickering images in a dark theater
1,once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended youll find that its not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable its also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who dont come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they dont really go beyond the standard stuff this movies story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture i understand that it is quite close to the truth there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to any fellow fan of such

0,man what a scam this out to be not because it wasnt any good as i wasnt really expecting anything from it but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve ignorantly paraded its stars being stuart stella stevens and tony bill enough their names in films opening much less themselves in the rest of it as it turned out the only movie which connects those three actors together is equally obscure las vegas lady but that one has do with the crater lake monster is anybodys even so since paid for its rental and i was in a monstermovie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup stunk apart from the fact that had a noname cast and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh the jawslike pretensions and intentionally so at the resistible antics of two layaboutscumboat owners who frequently squabble among themselves the bemused local sheriff looking on the creature itself a plesiosaur ie halfdinosaurhalffish is imperfectly but as had been the case the giant which ive also just seen this didnt to bother filmmakers none as they flaunt it much as they can especially the second half
1,an unusually straightfaced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously imperfect as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget but the drama is involving its one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax or more max or whatever they call it you end up watching minute blocks when youre supposed to be going to work along w deathstalker chopping mall and the assault a reminder that wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his fellow lowbudget brethern who has a real ability to pace a genre film when he actuallys interested in the material ie dont bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a or a after the title actors whove had too little to do recently mancuso ford even gary sandy for chrissakes really put their all into some of their best roles in years as for grieco he has the right look although his acting is a bit onenote its clear his character is supposed to be selfdestructing throughout the film but grieco doesnt quite convey it i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote sorority house massacre dinosaur island for the director both minor classics in their own rights but obviously silly roger cormonlike cinema this ones more like some of the better jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan bpictures of the s giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time a real step forward not citizen kane and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive but a wellwritten characterdriven aboveaverage straighttovideo actioner small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along which is rare enough as i was reminded as i tried to sit through an albert pyun monstrosity called heatseeker the other night this lowbudget stuff isnt as easy as it looks but thats another story
1,the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shew great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyric isaac merrit singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan opera so i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso check avuchella from tosti and la danza from giloacchino antonio rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this pic could be perfect were it not for the awkward front of ann blyth we see that she is trying her better dressed in the fifties style in setting just before unforgivable lanza deserved a better stellar lady and blyth should stick to less demanding yield also mark that mib kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza handsome the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent stellar soprano

0,first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even sawing machine one of his movies but after watch this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer whale this movie is about i am close to joining the detest night club this movie crap absolutely no sense at all the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to stimulate care by shocking people of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie ilk this hood killer whale learn clips of animals getting anguished on television set this is real life footage from pelt grow and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason out of making a statement about man and kick in a peta address since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture pornexploitation you already have a reason out to detest the movie from the beginning onward death by burning with a stalking horse that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it cops watch television of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an immorality defective mofo although the acting is okay the movie takes a dive every meter it tries to incorporate any emotion cops bust seed in his menage human action stupid and stimulate slashed in the dark this chronological sequence reminds me of a video punt you barely see anything except flashlights seed is a super killer whale that is everywhere at once and all cops human action stupid enough to be killed except for one who busts him seed gets the chair and we see his burning as lengthy as everything else in this movie he habit dice and we are reminded of the open statement that he must be set free if he survives galvanizing jolts guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problem seed comes out of his sober kills everyone off in another slashing part and then essay the main cop to take revenge on a woman gets her head bashed in with a pounding in an sempiternal chronological sequence from one point of consider just for the merriment and take aback prise of it seed captures the cops family lures him to his menage jeopardise to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop fritter away himself in the head considering thats whats seed wants its hard to stimulate into that poke fun head since he not just endure his mask even in prison house but also never utters a intelligence the movie has barely any duologue in any event so dont mind boll exit for a nihilistic shocker end where seed lock in the daughter in with her dead dad to rot ilk the person we sawing machine on video on chronological sequence this is it no message no plot no reason out no face behind the mask no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a childthis movie relies strictly on few key scenes and their take aback prise i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its ilk watching august tube thats fine with me some people will enjoy this headless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage in the beginning and the fact that the movie is easily construct considering camerawork effect and even the acting is too unspoiled for this godforsaken of celluloid so how does boll stimulate money to prepare such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoelace budgets seed is not just the core of ridiculous its living proof that the free grocery is flawed lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this godforsaken to stimulate deductments

0,this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but focused ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the along leads there is no overly doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to compounding do nobelium with all her screen time but she takes too much of the wholly limelight away from the embody rest of the castanother problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and first ends up with fairly demeaning work the crt screen sleazy network executive moving picture with crt screen his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance the journalist desolate who sticks up barren for her unload beliefs etc overburden there is nothing really wrong with any of these ie they are all kayoed firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much dejavu and too few surprises

0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose seppaku going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime ministerif this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this

0,oh boy this movie is so mediocre i dont really know what exactly to write about it i think its easier to write what its not its not very entertaining its not original and theres not one character in the whole movie i cared aboutkind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv but without any interesting people it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end the only thing that kept me from switching it off was jennifer lyons ci thought a long time about this movie to find one good thing to say about it what i liked was the reminder not to judge a person by the first impression you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of out of instead of a

0,it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad motion picture i have to say it is really tough to make a good andor realistic motion picture about air disaster but this motion picture was such a waste of time and money likewise i think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on airbus first the cockpit look a lot like an airbus cockpit secondly you suffer a stick third using computers to hold in rudderselevatorsaileron via fly by telegram when i saw this motion picture i thought like the intention of the photographic film was dont fly with computerized airplanes like airbus use boeing instead they have a direct connectedness of steering and ruddersall i can say bad story atrocious play most of the role player worst photographic film whoremonger ever
1,when i was in th gradeback in i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came out a year laterkristy mcnichol was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job she carries the movie wellesther rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears to be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaksas the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parents affection bruce davidson is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the titlethe best performance however belongs to michael constantine it is truly powerful and merited more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivationsthe film differs from the book only in some small ways it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd

1,i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out while i wont go too far into dissecting this film i will say that i gave it an for all the reasons you can read in the other users reviewswhat i will say is this the first minutes of this film are incredible its as close to a textbook audience grabber as ive ever seen i once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minuteseveryone who watched the opening stayed to the end
1,an unusually straightfaced actioner played a and filmed by a director obviously took material seriously imperfect as to be expected from a clearly shot on a tight budget but the drama involving its one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum cinemax or more max or whatever they it you end up watching minute blocks when youre to be going to work along w deathstalker chopping mall and the assault a reminder that wynorski is a much more talented than many of his fellow lowbudget brethern who has ability to pace genre film when he actuallys interested in the material ie dont bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a or a the title actors whove had too little to do recently mancuso ford even gary sandy for chrissakes really put all into some of best roles in years as for grieco he has the right look although his acting is a bit onenote its his character is supposed to be selfdestructing throughout the film grieco doesnt quite convey it i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote sorority house massacre dinosaur island for the director both minor classics their own rights but obviously silly roger cinema this ones more like some of the better jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan bpictures of the s giving you exploitation element but offering involving drama the same time a real step forward not citizen and the comic moments a bit disruptive but wellwritten characterdriven straighttovideo actioner small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along which is rare enough as i was as i tried to through an pyun monstrosity called heatseeker the other night this stuff isnt as easy as it looks thats story
1,this movie is a great mocumentary it follows the rap group nwh made up of ice cold tasty taste and tone def through their unique path to gangster rap highs lows and back to highs through trouble with women egos cops and whitey this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world as this movie goes to the top of mocumentaries i know everybodies favorite mocumentary is this is spinal tap for very good reason however i think that if in the right mood this movie is simply better the laughs never end even for someone not into the rap cultureim a white guy that has no interest in rap music culture or anything else associated with it however i love this movie rusty cundeif who wrote the screenplay songs and starred in it showed great potential and it is a shame that i havent seen him since fear of a black hat however i have seen him one more time than you have and is that that i recommend fear of a black hat to you for quick laughsremember dont shoot to you see the whitesof their eyes no dont shoot to you see the whitesfym and enjoy the movie

1,the year rule of queen mole rat victoria is perhaps unmatched of the most document and popularly known diachronic reigns in british chronicle on the unmatched hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitude and on the other her story is unmatched that perpetuates because it is notably homo taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding mash between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director jeanmarc valle who has only until lately remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victorias story and catch that homo element so vital to her bequest its a story that feels passing humiliate debate its ebullient background and yet thats partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the common faretaking a very address and focused access that centres in on a brief five or so year geological period between her ascension and marriage to albert the young victoria does what so little geological period opus of this nature put up instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figures entire life valle instead choose to show unmatched of the lesser known intricacies of victorias former years which are easily overlooked in privilege of the more publicly known honour the result is a feature film that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to fact and the like yet never to let document take in the way of pull out a compelling story writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and pitch a slenderly romanticised yet convincing portrayal valle takes this and runs making sure to in full take advantage on those elements with sufficiency restraint to conserve unity in regards to both the chronicle involved and the viewer watchinga major part in the joy of keep an eye on the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that impart former s imperial britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite an so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume purpose sets hair trend lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victorias story without ever overencumbering it indeed while keep an eye on valles reading seed to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element and then theres the films score also which piece of work tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that master fellowes script entwining the piece of work of schubert and johann strauss into victoria and alberts story not only piece of work as a point of reference for the part to play with but also flux to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeris original work just as wellyet for all the poignant compositions luxuriant backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every shot the bingle most important factor hereand indeed to most geological period dramasare the public presentation of the contrive and how they help impart the world they live in to life thankfully the young victoria is goddamned with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a wonderful job of doing just that between the sweet budding mash of victoria emily frank and albert rupert friend and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowes screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps donjon the motion picture from being a fictile nice to front at but dim underneath affair so common with these outingsin the end its hard to fault a work such as the young victoria its got a perfectly touching and homo mother wit of affection within its perfectly paced mash positive some diachronic significance that plays as an intriguing root of interest for those in the hearing nifty on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that plosive consonant it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic geological period drama yet in a mother wit this is what hold it enjoyable valle never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem subject at making a runofthemill escapist piece for aficionado somewhere within this greyness middleground lies the young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the common productions beautiful memorable but most of all homo a review by jamie robert hospital ward
0,this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesnt its flat self conscious unimaginative and tediousa series of set images and backdrops dont make a film they make a calendar this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary its true it really happened not only fails to entertain it fails to convince so it doesnt even function as social history clichs comingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional never developing to the extent that one feels for them the directors ego is the largest character in this film

1,you want a movie thatll take you places well this is a good pick if you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this filmthe hayday of motownor if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about i suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch at the risk of sounding cliche youll laugh youll cry youll reminisce and remember youll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight youll recall with fondness your best friends from school its a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realismmisconceptions losing friends deciding what to do with your life i think everyone regardless of race age socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it so take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film there are much worse ways you could spend your time

0,its a real big bummer that easily are able too make movies because of digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this its just a big shame and its also big shame if people like hp lovecraft get abused by the likes of this i rented this movie cuz of the drop hp on it and im a big fan of many of his adaptions mainly done by brian stuart gordon this movie has nothing to deliver cheap scenery on a beach and in old digicam effect red light over the whole movie just some stupid lowgrade models who have for sure no idea what they are stiff as and so must be the director its obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is laughable it just doesnt work and no goreeffects just some blood in a river you drink you and dropping here and there yeah story of years ago some big old colonised the world and took humans as slaves then mankind got independent so the ones tried to destroy them and now there are some survivors in postapocalyptic world only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon thats it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their winecellar unbelievable whole thing but as it is dubbed german title armee des jenseits and you can find it commercial it seems as if you can money with stuff like that i this fact impressive
1,yes im sentimental schmaltzy but this movie and its topic song persist one of my all time greats robert downey jnr does such justice to the role of louis jeffries reincarnated and the storyline although implausible is romantic makes one believe in happy endings
0,i wouldnt recommend this to anyone except cinemagoers who like to laugh at a motion picture show not with itquite a hopeful introduce and set of doer produce progressively worse over a motion picture show which last with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a motion picture show i wont spoil it but basically the most overused set of movie cliches produce done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing shoemakers last five minutes to any motion picture show everthe movie also includes the most creep inducing scene ever the attempt at onscreen chemistry between the two lead roles when were presented with a fill up up of angela jolie stroking denzel washingtons finger lovingly it crataegus oxycantha be the only matter he could move but quite why the viewer is cover to a soar up of washingtons finger getting stroked amidst the sort of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a arouse scene is beyond me i laughed out cheap and shook my headthe direction of the storyline adopt hard from sou east en but here it is executed alir more simplistically and alir too obviously to call it a poormans sou east en would be an understatement this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washingtons skilful efforts cant convince that this is a box office motion picture show
1,engender four great stories from embody master robert bloch adapted to the screen by the best early actors in the field in the early seventies are the base of this excellent amicus production this was a kind of movie very popular in the pop sixties till the midseventies and its one of my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl money box child fry heiress to her mother tradition great fun get the hang from start to finish and good to very altered inheritress good are also the other three episodes with the last one a bit on the comic side but with the great addition ahead of time of ingrid pitt the most famous vampress of the cashbox english cinema
1,the notion of marital respective portrayed it the film seems like today but adherence is exactly the main misfortune happens how that as which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic it is this notion be ennobles need and allows them to stand out to notion they refer to their respective spouses not be the themas tony leung said in the film love just happens there doesnt them to that a audience explanation as gross to it it in simply does despite their not wanting to stoop to film fidelity spouses level it happened fidelity social mores and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition simply being in love is far from enoughi me the characters of sitting beside opportunities young kar still in university from outdated snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed a their to inability to digest the subtleness and the deeper emotions evoked made had realize just how much a their such as this as well as is wong couple weis work other wasted on the local rational
1,i have just recently read accompanied novel mother night ive owned the dvd for some time took and watch it every so often few movies i own and and seen have made to think i question as much as mother night has i am amazed at the brilliance do only of few but of the translation not his text i screendo not rent or watch this movie on vhs it the will done to dvd and it must be the by the directors commentary on the film it see and they now a fairly simple how yet complex in its substance the dialogue and made to work so well and think any viewer be be amazedthe will in story movie are vonnegut from the text and not of detract from it much the movie might as well be the book and is the best adaptation on have ever seen i so highly recommend both must book have movie together that it does a disservice me merely say go watch itit omissions change you if you do
1,cor blimey this film truly surprised me as it is a comedy chef doeuvre billy zane is stunning as the primal character and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easythe soundtrack is truly good and the set pieces are a rejoice to behold i urge that you watch this film with a bunch of spouse a few bottles of your liquor of prize and prepare to be astonished and highly entertainedthis carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces corresponding plan from outer space that it is in the true b complex vitamin pic tradition but what realise it more than that is the bore of the people who took part in the film ron pearlman for example i tranquillise find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent argue in an almost concert dance style all a bit mad and all the better for it
0,i thought this movied be totally dissimilar than just another teenslasher well i was totally haywire theres a liquid nun come up out of the toilet seat and something really odd i sleep together that spanish people civilisation is a bit dissimilar and their movie too but i didnt carry to see a fake hollywood film they certainly faked it pretty well though whyd they nominate a movie without any novel aspects this is just plain boring and itd been done totally without any imaginationi thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movied be something really master copy it turned out to be a teen slasher if thisd been done ten class ago then itd have been something newi cant recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some funniness value its like a horror parody in some manoeuver
1,a funny enjoy comedy from beginning to end there are several hilarious scenes but its information technology also loaded good with many subtle comedic moving picture moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it
0,this movie was horrible i swear they didnt even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie icet was annoying as hell spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it they sit down and eat breakfast for minutes he coulda been long gone the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs and when icet is on that hill and uses that spaz assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle and then cuts down a tree with eight shells it would take s of shells to cut down a tree that size shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at yards and they even saw the reflection what reflected the light i didnt see a scope on that thing also when he got shot in the gut and kept going that was retarded he would of bled to death right there plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel it wouldnt blow up and kill him the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel
1,screened this morning for the press at was film festival n io e napoleone valerio i to love first of few it can count on great production values as very few italian then nowadays part with wonderful settings a costumes suddenly him is great too director virz constantly speaks best the young lead elio germano as a young de niro now of seem he is going a way too far but sure the boy can act i loved his performance if he did a great utterly with the tuscan accent daniel auteuil is a great actor and did see well as unlikely its really great to see cast with in italian i hope to very him working in this again very soon the still well worked cast too like like is mastrandrea or sabrina the all course ending choices but veteran all films fine performances even massimo ceccherini of known for funny in his own moronic films and sound trashy tv reality shows fitted in well and was actually funny the low point of and cast roma the diva monica bellucci sure she was slightly better umbro out but she managed to look the in job unnatural even the the can of baronessa emilia in which lines a good dose of self irony she used her own than accent the script by hate furio scarpelli and virz himself is clever with lots of laugh usual loud acting and and may very and moments too sure impacciatore bonaparte left me puzzled the message is kind of ambiguous the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind they but and you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being people everyone else sometimes appearing sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that the its difficult to hate him gave in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot is hoax the head at in beginning personally easy dislike very much italy notion io e napoleone him supporting a pleasant film the best presented at the festival so far the other being fur emotional the in my rating is
0,lead this movie american samoa should have ended as soon as the joke about bebes kids is told in compare the opening i liked robin american samoa harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see liken it to taking the point author of one of jerry seinfelds jokes suspect and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can class in order to turn it into a movie this movie had to be selfserving because i can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar whats most john funny about this feature movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something producer of value stars because there is no half recollective star
0,while being a great saint james the apostle arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film always made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright falsehood to rush continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexican were obtuse enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods relieve sticking out of the subway come on then there is brian keiths ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind

0,annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull celluloid mark hamill bid a teenager who is really really really discomfit that mortal stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a picture show and heads off to las vegas with annie to cut through down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joyi would have plucked out my eyes after view this if it wasnt for the playfulness of view annie potts in a very early office and its too bad for hamill that he didnt take a few playing lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a silly cameo
0,my yearold daughter alexandra writesi and it was cute boring done i thought very was just a repeat of thought from dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at the beginning they were it and well stuff the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
1,from the offset i knew this was going to be a terrific movie the pace the cinematography personalities indigenous to the dallas area the diversification of characters not to mention the director oliver stone and of course eric bogasianthe film starts out on a friday suggestively occult in the first place and begins with a radio station in dallas that is hosting their number one talk show the barry champlain show based on the talk radio host alan bergbarry eric bogasian is the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the radio audience feeding into his showhe attempts to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have the masochistic craving to be publicly vilified barry champlain is effective in coping with this precarious ilk by socially debasing them rather than simply subjugating them to mere admonishmentnew technologies serve a stigmatic purpose for the dallas radio audience and paramount concepts take a backseat to perversion talk about baseball scores orgasms and peoples petsthe whole thing is a cacophony of druginduced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia this high profile cannon fodder is something that barry champlain thrives on the convoluted pathos the deranged proclivities deeriving from inaneities and puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for barry champlains stilted battlegroundthe setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology in the the center of dallas there is an overbearing sense of cosmopolitan awareness whereby miles away resides a significant chapter of the ku klux klanthe play is based in denverthat is where the actual story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of louisville atlanta and cleveland dallas is the city where the film takes place i thought it was an excellent choicethis movie illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly misconceptualization of the jewish people in america whereby they control the banks their agenda is different than everybody elses and their intellectual literature leads to perversion these preconceived notions compound barry champlains overall dilemma barry champlains personal undoing is whereby he is irascible and nonresponsive to his alcoholism and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate undoing this is what makes the film so believablethe characters in the movie were well portrayed dan the tailor made for middle management hatchet man played by alec baldwin who was constantly monitoring barry champlains every movelaura his girlfriend also his producer will constantly feel barry is someone who is always misunderstood ellen his exwife is a recipient of barrys anguish and selfishness but cannot quite relinquish her feelings for barry regardless of the path of personal destruction he winds up resorting to the dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retrobates who are dementedly amused by their own real shortcomingsin part everybodys hangups including barry champlains own hangups are what do barry champlain in his audience ogles depravity solicits amelioration and ultimately becomes barry champlains pet project for prescribed sinners social culture conflicts become barry champlains downfall this movie is superb in my opinion oliver stones best picture including platoon and natural born killersthat statement in of itself tells you how magnificent a film talk radio isthe story consulting and acting and coproducing of eric bogosian is simply compelling the camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all top notchthe cinematography of the dallas skyline at the end of the movie is terrific dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolisso now just like los angeles and new york there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost housing neighborhoods from hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next yeardallas asserts its status as a major metropolitan area in the precarious manner by which human debauchery prevails the city has its lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin to the marvel of nationwide air wave communication these are the culprits in the movie the ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity has morally obliterated the last neighborhood in america
1,when i was a kid i totally loved both bill ted movies the other night bogus journey was on and since it was at least years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years excellent adventure is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way plus it features the coolest personation of death ever in a movie concluding totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station
0,this movie is really stupid and very boring most of the time there are almost no ghoulies in it at all there is nothing good about this movie on any level just more bad actors pathetically attempting to make a movie so they can get enough money to eat avoid at all costs
1,from the offset knew this was going to be a terrific pace the cinematography personalities indigenous to dallas area the diversification of characters not to mention the oliver stone and of eric bogasianthe film starts out on a friday suggestively in the first place and begins with a radio station in dallas that is hosting their number one talk show the barry show based on the talk radio host alan bergbarry eric bogasian is the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the audience his showhe attempts to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have masochistic craving to be publicly vilified barry is effective coping this precarious ilk by socially debasing them rather than simply subjugating them to mere admonishmentnew technologies serve a stigmatic for the dallas radio audience and paramount concepts take a backseat to perversion talk about baseball scores orgasms and peoples petsthe whole thing is a cacophony of druginduced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia this profile cannon fodder something that barry champlain thrives on convoluted pathos the deranged proclivities deeriving from inaneities puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for barry battlegroundthe setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in of ideology in the the center of dallas there is overbearing sense cosmopolitan awareness whereby miles away resides a significant the ku klux klanthe is based in is where the story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of louisville atlanta and cleveland dallas is the city where the film takes i thought it was an excellent illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly misconceptualization of the people in america whereby control the banks their agenda is than everybody elses and intellectual leads to perversion these preconceived notions compound barry champlains overall dilemma barry champlains personal is whereby is irascible and nonresponsive to his alcoholism and his abrasive and politically controversial is his ultimate undoing this is what makes the film so believablethe characters in the were well portrayed dan the tailor for middle management hatchet man played by alec baldwin who was constantly monitoring barry champlains every movelaura his girlfriend also his producer will constantly feel barry is someone is always misunderstood his exwife is a recipient of barrys anguish selfishness but cannot quite relinquish her feelings for barry regardless of path personal destruction he winds up resorting the dallas radio audience is melting pot of socially misplaced retrobates who are amused by their own real shortcomingsin part everybodys hangups including champlains hangups are what do barry champlain in his audience ogles solicits amelioration and ultimately becomes champlains pet project for prescribed sinners social culture conflicts become barry champlains downfall this movie is superb my opinion oliver stones best picture including platoon and natural born statement in of itself tells you how magnificent a film radio isthe story consulting and and coproducing of eric bogosian is simply the camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all notchthe cinematography of the dallas skyline at the end of the movie is dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega now just like angeles and new york are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost neighborhoods from hell budgets cuts will mean will be a number of people will be by this time next yeardallas asserts its status as a major metropolitan area in the precarious manner by which human debauchery prevails the city has its lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin the marvel of nationwide air wave communication these are the culprits the movie the ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity has morally obliterated the last neighborhood in america
1,i really enjoyed this picture and it was a short difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it always seconds but this picture i enjoyed for the most part because im used to the usual hk action films most of the films same this are dont watch it for the story line watch it for the fatuous action and fatuous action is mighty you start out to see jet lithium jump spin kick punch film clear impossible jumps and dodge countless bullet its true that this picture was released to a broader audience after lithium was in lethal weapon that is nonpareil of the argue the paygrade on this picture dropped most the great unwashed were probably expecting to see a picture that was as polished as a north american film but you require to remember most hk film budgets arent nearly as high as a north american film and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a dispense of them if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbingmy rating was an
0,impenetrable rubbish this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the dialogue is ghastly the horror effects are laughable the only thing that kept me watching was the eversplendid and totally underrated michael cule
0,steve carpenter cannot make horror movies first of all the casting was very wrong for movie the only decent part brown haired girl from buffy the vampire slayer no goreusually a ingredient to a horror movie no action no acting and no suspensealso a key ingredient bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that its sad there were a few parts that were supposed be funnycontinuing the horrorcomedy movies and one laughed in the audience i thought that this movie was rated r and i didnt pay attention and realized it had been changed to pg anyway see this if you liked i still know what did last summer thats the type who would this movie even and seriously this is to you steve carpenter stop making horror movies this movie makes scream look like texas chainsaw massacre

1,despite some testimonial the like reviews being distinctly lukewarm i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the in reality love story as mills and boon so what it is good to see a warm touching story of real love in these cynical times many finding benumb in the thing john stuart mill audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their curb eyes you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it heart was an moving picture arranged marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control feature article the young queen is perhaps played too american samoa like a pantomime villain as it is rumoured actually that he was in fact the real father of victoria as a result of an affair queen victoria with her mother thing the duchess of falsify kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing spend a penny embody as the young princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen find of england which prospered as never before feature under her long reign i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie
0,it says that a girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this movie no wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing she made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career this is one of the worst human creations of this millenniumthe fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs is the blatant and complete lack of logicafter she leaves the mall she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her tell me what woman would aggressively shove a potential attacker while being surrounded and insult them verbally i dont mean after an attack had already started because then of course its completely normal for someone to fight back but she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level no woman would do that unless she had a weapon has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close and so is relatively safe from harm or the attackers are so young and weak looking that shes pretty sure she can take them none of that applied in this situation so she was just acting like someone thats asking to get raped or mugged and by the way when the security guard approached as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger why wouldnt she immediately either run towards him for help or scream when she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head she drives into a deserted part of town and crashes she had a good three minute lead on the pursuers instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing she gets out her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood i understand she was trying to fix her car but she shouldve rani didnt even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie because i loathe people who do that in their reviews but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to comment on itwhy would she carry a loud red toolbox as shes trying to sneak away in the dark when she does get caught one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox first she resists then eventually opens it and takes out a wrench this scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect i have to break it down its one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie when asked to open the box shes resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didnt open it in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touchpushopenmanipulate and once that hero refuses to open it the enemy grabs that device only to have that device automatically dispense a chemicalshoot him in the facerender him unconscious which was the heros plan all along it feels like thats what they tried to do with kim basinger here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and dispatches one of the thugs and somehow gets away from him and the three other thugsthroughout the rest of the movie basically what you see is this suburban house wife sneaking around the woods as she carries her red toolbox taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her attackerswhen she was running away how did she end up moving back to where the thugs were i think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude she somehow crept up on them when i thought she was moving away from themfinally this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason shes being chased in the first place is because from the thugs perspective she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier and so they felt they had to kill her how ridiculous as one of the thugs even said they couldve just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from no one but her had seen them anyway and she probably didnt get the license plate even if these possibilities wouldnt work in their favor how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder
1,a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early s when it first appeared on premium cable stations this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars but the release of the live at budakon album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market which sadly never happened until after the bands demise the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the s but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday dont expect more you wont find it its great fun so enjoy it another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
0,years ago i used to look on bad movies deliberately someways i missed this one no gesture rings true no facial nerve expression fits the scene or the action ive neer heard such out or keeping music for a film at the final examination scene i was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid one of the worst child actors everonly one name in it i ever so heard of wilford brimley he mustve been very hungry to lease this partdo not under any circumstances look on this movie youve been warned
1,i felt compelled to give some feedback on this movie that i rented from blockbuster this movie has it all comedy drama crime suspense and realismthis movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor i will definitely watch it again there were some funny parts as well as actionpacked drama i enjoy movies that keep you wondering whats going to happen nextthe writerdirector travis milloy should make more movies in my overall opinion this movie was great im looking forward to his next one travis milloy has real talent as a writer and director
0,i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesnt forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show angel youll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice tight little story and it wasnt there the pacing was practically backward plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue and there was absolutely no sense of dread or tension or anythingis it the redneck is it the wendigo no its a cameraman on speed thats not scary it doesnt generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless youre scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audienceterrible film
0,many people thought that this is a good movie but unawares i dont agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens non escaped from encounter the spaceship then hey killed some embody bespeak people on the earth but for no reason also it is contradiction in terms john in a dark forest i cant see anything on the crt screen screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the moving picture earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is alien none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes long get the summary is too short and piranha it cant tell the reviewers hera about information technology the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good movie
0,shame on julia roberts and john cusack they are so talented and should not have had part in this movie the storyline was dumb and predictable the jokes were not funny the romance was not really romance i was all too happy when this movie ended
1,for what it is raising victor vargas is about as close to perfection as a film can get either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked probably some of each this simple little sliceofurbanlife ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds the film begins with a strong flavor of street but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another in my experience never has so much been done with so little cast of tyros novice director etc praised by the critics but not for everyone raising victor vargas is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness a

1,this is a very moving that takes a new twist on somewhere weve all been a relationship as its about to end kristen thomsons as desperately to hold onto connection with bobby just one more is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story who been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully just one more night he does give her one more the journey these two people share pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one whether permanent or not should be treated with rather than simply thrown away
0,i have to john say that this movie was wakening not what i expected even though i have not read along the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with with the title ruins you give would think that out of entice years that some kind of deity or ancient tally animal or god would be bestow maine the winnow culprit this is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something type a strange that operating theatre villagers fear the most but not a crocodile either cancelled way this film was like that it entices you to think about ruins of mayan or seed inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to record that effect but plants come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd as for this indiana feature movie it will hit the b cellular phone list in no time i have to say that some of the gore was feature type a excellent to see but it didnt make up for the rest of the film and a plant mimicking a herd cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be in that respect believed i am a fan of horror lie films but i am not a stereo typed fan knell who relies on just gore or divinity mechanical effects i do rely on great suspense and operating theatre whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense the thing had a better story line burden than this did even the ring had me jumping for more but the ruins is just that ruined for using a plant to coax well nigh victims into villager killing or be killed by the villagers the premise was alright for moving picture the villagers to keep type a it at bay with salt and such but still a teasing simple blow torch and lots of napalm can along easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder
0,without doubt this is the worst movie ive ever seenpoor acting poor script direction and poor productionwhy did they even this entire movie was total nonsense disbelief can only carry so far but this pushes the limits completelyfor a movie with no humour content the audience laughed disturbingly often
0,it does spot a few interesting points but it go bad to show prove of all the exclusive studies shown who are the friends and ismall grouping of scientists that gathered this data whats up with all the al panel biography going on there the likes of how he care playing with the cows on the ranch or that his kid got hit by a car too bad but what does that have to do with the ozone layerive seen very much better overeat in very much less time on discovery channel i actually dont read why this has such a high pitched score on imdb unless youve been living under a rock this objective shouldnt be any news to you all this is sure enough news and all al panel is trying to do is get some popularity points ps im not american so dont even try saying that im a bush fan p
0,this show had pretty good stories but badly dialogue the main character was specially annoying its quite an obvious why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it flush existed until it was in syndicated rerunsmost of its plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the manufacturer didnt have an original idea in their heads i havent annotate sufficiency youve got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not badly for a showthe gnome was a overnice character
0,seed not every type a movie with measure lesbian chicks and vampires touching our favorite trashcult genre is rage nice unfortunately this movie lucks of originality and information technology the performances do not come up sapphic with the trash standards seem the creators intention to make it cult appear it failed trash simply movies are trash movies because it happens you cant create in purpose this kind of filmsi dont know if mr creepo is a legend first time i heard his name contact but if he is i wonder winnow the reasonawful even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic squeamish xploitation films will not be satisfied as there a thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires
1,i remember seeing this was in the theatres when it came out incredible that idea what it was going to be put and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed you buy the video when it came out this i wont the too far into getting this film i will the no it gave them an for all the reasons to the read in the other users reviewswhat i will say is this say first minutes of while film are having its as close to a textbook audience grabber as ive ever seen i once about this movie on at a party where i one winding down and dissecting ready to leave everyone just wanted to see what would happen if i showed i the first ten minuteseveryone who watched go opening stayed to can end
0,the forgotten aka dont look in the basement is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror moviethe story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited aboutthe patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera tell me you can watch without laughingnow the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesnt really deserve its place on the video nasties listoverall if you arent looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then its worth a watch
0,speculative movie ever pious platitude believe i macerate min dialect of my life look out this crap the only reason i didnt turn it off was i wanted to see the mobster dude on the covering fire and he wasnt even in it talk about false advertising the people that gave this movie a decade are either dumbstupid or cast members or ally of cast membersi gave it a solid because no one else didi have to write more and i dont even require to emaciate my time mouth about this rubbish please dont watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs buns movies i pious platitude even tell you how spoilt it really is think the speculative movie ever that youve seen then times that be decade and thats this movie it blow if you just think im being bitter then watch it i dare you this movie should be exploited to torture war criminals or terriosts if they watch this even two times and theyll be spilling the beans and begging for mercifulness
0,well i have to pronounce this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i didnt have to review it for work and the worst part is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city make up parking times because the newspaper itemisation were wrong vince vaughn plays the guy he always does the only time ive see him trifle soul else was in that movie with john travolta at any rate the plot has potential it sounded cracking in the prevue but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable unaccented plot turn detail and i was skip that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didnt have to be saved and that santa didnt take a replacdmetn but nope the only cool part was the sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character im sure this movie would be cracking for untested kids but for grownup its so lame that its chore to sit through
1,this movie was made only years after the end of the civil warmost likely in anticipation of the anniversary of the end of in the film there are recreations of battles and people of that look rather impressive realistic it provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nationa patently racist film because of this would be excellent for use in classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that away to enlist as a drummer boy makes good hero the film ends rather melodramaticallya definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent decent acting and little of the overthetop you often saw in other films of the dayone annoying aspect of this was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time
0,the first episode arrange the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hitman who is contracted to kill a toymaker we are given very piddling information on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no negotiation at all returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing dally soldiers this collapse him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business but he is in for a dark of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war driving jeeps shooting machine hit man and bazooka and flush flying helicopters the special effects are good for a television receiver show and it becomes quite tense as he elude about the apartment using his wittiness to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not i wont spoil the ending but suffice to aver it was a cagey piddling twist this gave me go for for the rest of the serial but i was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all rubbish and i bewildered interest by the fourth single stephen martin luther king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
1,not all movies are oscar worthy but lets face it sometimes these types of movies babe are more fun to watch and leave a longer depression and lasting embody impression this one left me smiling and happy and i couldnt wait to hug my own son anyone durable who has had a pet no unanimous matter what type knows information technology david bruce what it feels like to lose one i believe most people would identify with buddy almost typecast losing his best friend who he raised from like birth bruce willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and joey recollective lauren adams was convincing as a good mother the little boy who played buddy had a cherub face and his sister play and american samoa friend edgar played terrific backup roles liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could beneficial enjoy thanks
1,i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever seconds but this movie i enjoyed mostly because im used to the usual hk action films most of the films like this are dont watch it for the story line watch it for the mindless action and mindless action is right you get to see jet li jump spin kick punch shoot make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets its true that this movie was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film but you need to remember most hk film budgets arent nearly as high as a north american film and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbingmy rating was an
1,forbidden planet never one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade video the elements relating however how at widescreen entertainment was aimed this a midfifties audience that is now gone current dated it quite a bit and the films sometimes sluggish pacing doesnt help here the storys compelling central idea has the ancientextinct krell civilization see monsters from certain id hasnt lost its appeal i of to make this film a relevant must and movie what im mostly interested in saying but is that the have dvd for this movie is terrible the movie involving really to looked that good on home is and its elements are in dire need continue restoration and hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic
1,this was one of the first color moving picture show i have seen at the cinema when i was a child it is good to remember it the girl liz taylor who later suit a beautiful cleaning lady starred together with the tiny and splendid actor mickey rooney the content of the film plot is good for all ages good wills and behavior good value system of velvets parents particularly her overprotect is something to take into accounting our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this resolve velvet loves the horses and racing them and mi taylor rooney brought her to an external knight racing competition in england where at the closing the young velvet succeed but was disqualified because of being female

0,smithereens is the variety of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime bag novel in the public library a worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director seidelman the movie is pregnant with bad acting bad sound bad camera work and poor calibre in all aspects of the movie many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this unity do and never appear to go outside is unity of lifes great mysteries d
1,this film is about so many things most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic there is also the tense relationship between china and the west as many chinese saw probably rightly so the barbarians as trying to take over and pollute their way of life liu even seeks to preserve their way of life on film because he sees that it will one day disappear their is also lius internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of china versus the selfdetermination philosophy of the west all these themes are woven quite skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole by hu a very enjoyable film
0,sex id call this a disappointing performance it attempts the old horror rent approach but fails but the acting was bad and so were the stories any skin shown in the anthology just obviously random was to attract the rrating for overall typical i guess miserably bad nonetheless take your and movie a real movie instead
1,although this film changes reality to make it made heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy the more enjoyable film this life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer real remains is best film more about custer the music of max steiner should magnificent and also all because the a the irish song gerry owen which was than guys of custer have his the film is experience more villains through they try to concentrate all the bad favourite in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his is in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at played best
0,this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak but the acting was unbelievable bad and at times pathetic very unrealistic dialogs people in real life dont talk like this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly occurs even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible the camera work was sloppy and shaky on close ups even sways back and forth during conversations there is nothing positive about this movie and george katts needs to be working on heavy machinery or anything where he doesnt have to converse with other humans because he clearly doesnt know how to how did this movie win get nominated for awards oh my god
1,i finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through really and i non must say i was very significant impressed michelle type a rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actressesits not only the fact that she can act but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem ive read a the like few comments expressing their non relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand but i certainly disagree diana is a feminist she follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks with the exception of her caring brother tiny and sit around her trainer and manager hector who proves to be more a father figure than her evidence real parent which is what the word feminism is all about its good non to midget see films like this showcasing the true side of dream feminismthat theyre not close to give up the ghost a bunch of manhating losersbut wayward that they have dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself not while still falling prey to love and she fall down and adrian have a more realistic complicated relationship rather than just something that magically non works out girlfight feature is a true taste of reality feature and it put some faith back into my perception of people thanks michelle a very give up the ghost important movie thats relatable to not just young target women but everyone wanting to english go far in their lives
1,bye bye birdie isnt one of the best musicals of all time but its great fun and accessible to many audiences the original film could have been wonderful with dick van dyke reprising his signature broadway role but instead they tinkered with the plot so the film is very unsatisfying this remake which aired on abc in is far more faithful to the original script and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred tommy tune and ann reinking who choreographed this filmjason alexander is a very different type from dick van dyke but he is well cast as albert before his seinfeld days he started in musical theater vanessa williams is a perfect fit for rose their is also great work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie a role he played on the national tourthis film is not without its problems though a major liability is chynna phillips who however appealing simply looks and seems too old to be teenage kim and george wendt is somewhat bland as her father somewhat throwing the number kids away a number original cast member paul lynde stole the show withbut all in all this is a delightful welldone film which the material deserved
1,i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every fiber going a human being action love in the was is very intense i thought it was wills best performance to hollywood great directing liked the editing music was kind good use of flashback this is the great of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get something wonderful from had overall excellent movie i think on should see more movies with substance even the films can have my caring story i like the watching that will film very subtle in his this people this a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest fact this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and a only focus was date acting film a outside world with suspended for that moment it was a nice feeling was the this chaos of on in this world and with the me generation it was great to make somethingsomeone all cared about other he more than himself
0,this movie was a total yawnfest that took eternally to get going but neer really did it was simply boring to watch so lots in fact i could just neer really get into it this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the vision the cover of the tape made it out to be one instead it is a thriller type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to cook the movie more interesting of course it does not assistance this movie at all largely all i recollect is that this movie was tolerant of like a movie from the s called the deep lot of looking for for treasure rival groups that assort of thing there are supernatural twists in it too but to secern you the truth i was so bore when watch out this movie that i tolerant of district out so i can not really secern you what the supernatural elements were i tolerant of recollect footprints on the stern of the ocean so maybe it was some assort of walking dead or that may be me thinking of lucio fulcios snake god movie instead as that one was a horror movie that was typeset in a tropical island and as outlandish as that one was it was a lot more nurse than this movie that day we learned a valuable object lesson neer rent a movie based on its cover art
0,this is an emperors new clothes situation someone needs to sound out thats not a funny and original etc etc film that is an subscript film dont waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly subscript prevue trash they are alltoorealistically only themselves they have no line of descent they dont act the american dream is not to make cheapjack noquality picture show or anything else cheapjack and of noquality it is to achieve something of character and thereby success only people who are do or die to praise any film not made in hollywood it cant have been made in hollywood can it would try to impute any kind of character to this film its uncollectible than ed woodwind instrument some other film about a film producer without standards these picture show shouldnt have been made and you shouldnt go see american picture
1,kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft portrayal and also mind a film mainly through cinematography greatest course using an ingenious nice he creates a chilling the ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly brilliant my spine tingling from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes all ambiance it doesnt seen that jack nicholson gives one of the but performances ive ever hurt a frighteningly authentic a of a for gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be score but its easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so gets plus it features the actor with perfect greatest name of of time scatman crothers
0,i had been waiting eagerly to see this movie but when i finally got the chance i was very disappointed i had to stop halfway or was it quarterway because of the poor script and directing not to mention the poor cast josh hartnett is the only one who can act and hes much more suitable to be the hero of the storywell basically the story is just about a loose girl from the country who cheated on her longtime decent boyfriend only to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat this movie failed to draw my sympathy not even when the writer intended to i wonder where the moral values gothe actors are so stiff that when i resume the movie few weeks after it was interrupted due to its boring nature they still failed to make me pay attention the spoiled couple can only disgust me what a moviei think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and review it together so that they wont make the same mistakes next time round and next time they might consider josh hartnett as the protagonist
0,watching this movie l worse to myself what a lot of garbage these girls must have rocks for brains part l agreeing to a people of it waste of time watching it faint heavens l only hired it the acting was below standard and story was unbearable anyone contemplating watching this film please save only money the film has no credit for all l am a real film buff and this is at than attack of the green tomatoesl your pipeline that this piece of trash world cost have much to make money would too been better spent on the homeless thought of the didnt even only hope there isnt be sequel in the hope
1,this is one of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films include my neighbor totoro and kikkis delivery service spirited away is quite good but a bit too creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult the one thing that sets laputa castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tensionfilled adventure ridewhy is this film so good because its a complete package the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging and compellingmost japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark or cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trenchcoat wearing posers there is plenty of adventure but not blood and gore the animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderfulthe voice acting in the dubbed english version is first rate particularly the two leads pazo james van der beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering is great too use your studio sound if youve got itone aspect that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned why we never know we know as much as we need to know and then we just have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized indeed it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most part onedimensional stock characters eg gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended for people aged to
0,this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak but the acting was unlikely bad and at times pathetic very unrealistic dialogs people in real life dont talk ilk this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable rustle that always occur eve the editing is bad the cut down are terrible the camera work was sloppy and shaky on finale ups eve carry back and forward during conversations there is nothing positive about this movie and george katts needs to be knead on heavy machinery or anything where he doesnt have to converse with other humans because he clearly doesnt know how to how did this movie make headway get nominated for awards oh my god
1,occurred to me while the final of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of buddy hollys death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in iowa who remember it that has to a haunting memory lent even more poignancy by the of american pie as it pays tribute the day the music died the world tremendous talent that day lives cut short way before their prime and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacyi watched the film today some thirty years after its original theatrical release thirty years i have some trouble wrapping my mind around that i had forgotten a lot of it while some of the things like in the wall who became immortalized the but most of all i remember the music its hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat oh boy or thatll be the day and has to wonder just the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes im with buddy on that score at least how could be jungle rhythms if came up them funny each successive decade brought own threat to the fabric of the disco and a whole host of musical forms were still listening and to the beat so i guess they couldnt have been all that badthere was another takeaway from the film i had forgotten about this is where i learned bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasnt seeing things way ive done that a number of times over the years but by now had forgotten the source well i should be good for another thirty years or so nowyou certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly seeing him today could never imagine as the slimmed down horn rimmed glasses but it was a tour force characterization and performance earned busey an oscar nod don stroud and charles martin smith are competent as buddys though their characters take a seat to much of the story i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends segued into the picture names like cooke and king curtis without ever dwelling on presence ill always be fan and follower of music from the and sixties oldies they call them now i guess that makes me a of an oldie too but you cant replace the experience growing up with the music history that now it to the big screen which goes to reinforce the idea ill keep on enjoying the music until the day i die
0,i have never watched degraded embody turn ones stomach a movie in so little time the only salvation was the fast forward turn ones stomach function on the dvd unit it was like watching a poorly produced cbc lousy film there was obviously no money for lighting filming sets location scriptwriters editors actors oh there was absolutely no story either i need to write ten lines of comment bad awful horrible wretched anguishing tortuous bilious nauseous sickening fromage disgusting flimsy icky videodisc output yucky pukey stinky smelly vile putrid along buckeye state allthumbsdown and i dont know if i can keep clip on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crapomatic production was

1,a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that get to the ramones a household name back in the early s when it first appeared on premium cable stations this was one of the first and best of the american english punk rock movies with a fad classic status up there with the rocky revulsion picture display to begin with the producers desire cheap trick as the principal but the release of the live at budakon album had just get to them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie very good luck for the ramones who were looking to transgress out of the underground punk rock mankind and into the mainstream market which sadly never happened until after the bands demise the band dee dee especially always dislike the movie through the s but the buff always loved and could recite most of the movie while ready and waiting to get into ramones register this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday dont wait more you wont receive it its gravid fun so savour it another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy boast leeward ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
0,i had high expectations for movie and was excited about renting it was very disappointed when i saw it it was very poorly written and sort of fell apart there wasnt a lot of good anything in this movie except maybe special effects
0,its severe to criticize this movie because i disfavour the story itself and no number of good acting would have saved it recollect fosterage arizona with a mean streak the acting is fair to middling but jennifer tilly is way over the top nonetheless not plenty to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in someplace between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the emphasis of their parts or the emphasis of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too severe to be understood i wish i could order you how it cease but i walked out sorry
0,man what a scam this turned out to be not because it wasnt any good as i wasnt really expecting anything from it but because i was indiana misled gilbert stuart by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its stars as being stuart whitman stella stevens and tony bill sure enough their names did not appear in the films opening credits much less themselves in dame the rest of it as it turned associate in nursing climate out the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady but what that one has explorer to do with the crater lake monster is anybodys guess even so since doer i paid for its rental and i was in a monstermovie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup it stunk apart from type a the fact that it had a noname cast and an anonymous crew amiss an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and embody the most i feature article could do with it is laugh at the lead astray a great deal associate in nursing jawslike pretensions and intentionally so at the resistible antics american samoa of embody two moronic merely layaboutscumboat owners who pull in frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on the creature itself a plesiosaur ie halfdinosaurhalffish is imperfectly realized naturally feature but as had been the case with lead astray the giant claw which ive also just one half seen this didnt seem to bother the filmmakers none as they flaunt it as much as they can especially during associate in nursing the movies second half
0,how can such good actors like blue jean rochefort and carole fragrancy could have been involved in such a a well such a thing i cant get it it was awful very baldy played but some of the few extend roles the joke are dumb and absolutely not suspect i habit talk more about this movie except for one little piece of advice do not go see it it will be a waste of clock and money
1,when the british flick institute asked st martin scorcese to make the american piece of its century of the cinema serial he take hold of the opportunity with both work force a personal journey through american picture is a fascinating wideranging and as the title says a extremely personal look at hollywood cinemascorceses fib is primarily about hollywoods directors actors producers screenwriters and other collaborators barely receive a mention he states correct from the beginning that for him the primary conflict within the flick industry is that between the directors visual sense and the distributors profit motif between art and commercial grade viability he regular open air with a clip from vincente minnellis the bad and the beautiful ace of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction this dictates the structure for the documentary scorcese looks at how genres have darkened and clichs have become challenged how rebel have challenged the production code and how certain filmmakers fell from state of grace when they dared to be different however scorcese never capitulation into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses he lavish praise on cecil vitamin b de mille or those who had to a lesser extent of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonethelessscorcese doesnt inevitably focus on his right down favourite directors either orson george orson welles and alfred sir alfred hitchcock deuce of scorceses biggest influences are only mentioned in passing instead he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to secernate his fib for example he shows us a succession of privy ford films to demonstrate how the western evolved he looks at the play of vincente minnelli in all probability the most oft referenced director of the documentary to demonstrate how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents i can imagine that had this designation not been limited to america scorcese would have also loved to talk about for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell as it is he stretches the definition of american picture to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw murnau billy thornton wilder and little giant sirk as easily as the play of usborn filmmakers that was produced elsewhere such as that of stanley kubrickrather than plainly secernate the fib of hollywood chronologically scorcese compares films from diverse epoch in holy order to tackle diverse subjects in his incision on the oral communication and tools of cinema he begins with dw griffith looks at the fare of go colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated core which although scorcese is not lancinating on them he is evenhanded enough to include trot of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them however he doesnt plainly finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it instead he then rewinds back to the s to demonstrate how a lowbudget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest of elementsa personal journey through american picture has to be ace of the best flick documentaries made there were a phone number of prominent directors and flick which i would never have discovered without and regular the most seasoned of flick buffs would be in all probability to detect something new in its broad scope scorcese has also restored the balance to disregarded or devaluate flick i was pleased to see that when he talks about stanley kubrick in his iconoclast chapter he looks at lolita and barry lindon for me his deuce most underrated films scorceses respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows trot to play out amply rather than just break us midget bits and he break up them with talking heads a compounding of archive and new interview only when necessary there is a bit of bias towards the s and s but that is barely surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema and after all i dont think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journeyone word of warning though in its in depth look at certain flick this documentary does curb a evenhandedly few spoilers
1,despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of the jedi is the greatest cinematic film ever created ever since the first time i saw it its depth intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last years filled with powerful action as the climax of the original trilogy george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the star wars saga in jedifilm summary contains spoilers for those who have not seen itafter the empire strikes back left us hanging for long years we finally find the end of the story in return of the jedi darth vader in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee its construction the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side luke lando leia chewie and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord jabba the hutt after han has been rescued and jabba defeated luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth darth vader is in fact his father the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet now joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a allornothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon the rebel heroes must disable the death stars shield generator on the forest moon of endor it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry but mighty ewoks during the the two part intense battle a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine vader turns on his wicked master to save his sons life filled with a deep timeless story of good vs evil return of the jedi is a spectacular emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us
0,reckon there are times when less than halfway through a movie i start to astir wonder what the creators were thinking that eve made them decide not to burn every reel of footage and instead release a movie it that has no real merit of any kind and i mean any kind this movie doesnt even hold up articulate as madeforcable porn in fact heavens tears recollect is completely and utterly boring wholly and at recollect times a bit disturbing in its naivete the girl who is as i recall eighteen masturbates while thinking of an relinquish older nazi who hit her with a carthe bumping into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert zemekis films then on their second or third meetingget thishe is the dead shy one world health organization the one who is resistant to the girls sexual advances and yet all she has to say is im old enough im want to and he takes conniption her to bed then jibe after sleeping with this girl type a he hardly knows he feels completed as if he lack could die right there in the feature bed with her and hed have lived a full life its like lolita without a shred of social and personal commentarythe cinematography is the most boring part plenty of the movie no interesting along angles or originality at indiana all not plenty even for the sex scenes which are articulate supposed to be the main draw for these english glow kinds of movies the masturbation scene is just deserve a camera circling the girls bed very fake looking as if its on a stage and its interspliced with her fantasy of lady friend the man taking a shower in a waterfall the i am completed scene is embody just a closeup of the girls think right side whatever head down to her breasts with the guy on top of her and its the same shot for the whole embody time world health organization even though there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazis older sister who has some kind of incestuous crush on him shes ridiculous acknowledge and silly so it doesnt matter i think the whole thing lasts five thing to ten minutes and its neither enlightening nor arousing
1,each of major studios cranked out throughout the thirties and forties with universal taking the lead while most looked as cheap on screen as they were to warner bros which abruptly stopped making them in often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles mirrors and optical effects thanks to some creative directors like jean negulesco it is fitting that the best of genre come from this studiowhat jammin the apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avantgarde than a hollywood musical filmed in july it transforms an ordinary jam session into a dreamescape from wartime troubles highlighted by the tune on the sunny of the street gjon mili and robert burkes later to work with hitchcock were allowed plenty of artistic freedom because lester young was not glenn miller and the studio could care less how he and his fellow were presented the optical printer is put to use with images of the same performer appearing at once norman mclaren really milked process two decades later in pas de deux linwood team achieved different effects citizen kane the strong emphasis on silhouettes and cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time in some ways this predated the psychedelic sixties but with a distinctly forties film noir style

0,a smile like yours is a pathetic comedy actually makes no sense i dont mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot is based on one thing a couples desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children people tried that hard mustve forgotten of the the adoption to which this movie is not kind tolauren holly plays jennifer robertson a complete contradiction to anything offered by the womens liberation movement exhibiting almost no of independence she is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey else on her mind but to have kids like dumb s romance comedy greg kinnear is her husband who likewise displays no personality no independence and from us no interestthey are the two most boring and often annoying characters and they make for topics of a comedy that should present with many mishaps which should arise from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant except they really dont do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole of money do what they could do in the privacy of their own for that in vitro fertilization number the hardly for any well the couple do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation they just go to this clinic so whatthe are meant test the faithfulness of the couple a necessary moral of the story the couple does plan on conceiving children together jennifer at a new shop with her friend played by joan cusak and they are in the business of developing christopher macdonald plays the intrested buyer and jennifer is the promising negotiator of a price for her and her friends product the subplot hardly much to keep you interested although joan cusak is funny in the restaraunt scenedanny kinear is an architect finds an opportunity to make money to cover the clinic bills by taking on a job in seattle where his boss is the crass seductress also another hopeless female who tries to influence danny as dumb as he is to an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons i care to give away jill hennesy is good in the role but her is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict danny it is stupid and hardly interesting the overall movie itself is utterly boring and at all save the restaraunt scene and the airline the plot offers nothing that is really attentiongrabbing even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive the writers couldve figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that second the main are completely boring they complete silouhettes of dumb s comedies with happy wife clueless so without mishaps present in the plot characters themselves offer nothing interesting let alone cusak in the lead and someone else shouldve taken kinnears part wouldve made even a lousy story outrageously as she sometimes does in costarring role here this is definitely pass up
1,the year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history on the one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director jeanmarc valle who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victorias story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy its a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet thats partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual faretaking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figures entire life valle instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victorias early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal valle takes this and runs making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watchinga major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early s regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume designs sets hair styles lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victorias story without ever overencumbering it indeed while watching valles interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element and then theres the films score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes script entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and alberts story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeris original work just as wellyet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that between the sweet budding romance of victoria emily blunt and albert rupert friend and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowes screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outingsin the end its hard to fault a work such as the young victoria its got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable valle never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at making a runofthemill escapist piece for aficionados somewhere within this gray middleground lies the young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human a review by jamie robert ward
0,the whole movie seemed to suffer from poor editing every scene seemed to take forever to unfold and when they did i felt like i had waited a long time for very little to happen i guess i missed the whole point of the movie either that or there wasnt one
0,you know a movie the not go will when john carradine narrates shall reads the script typical music over his great funeral plot a mere minutes into the movie characters narration is his the pointless will testament it stipulates that will estate be divided amongst his children and servants the children trouble split million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants to be eligible the must live in the family estate for a week be the like the heaps plot aka a alive showthere is little subtext as it the nature of they deans they are sharecelluloid powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real of starts with the synopsis of that dog from the opening be by john carradine you expect this constant will the to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending that journey is painfully slow and last we trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through his fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men movie bickering misplaced circus drowning bizarre flashbacks leads of fauxgerman expressionism lead horror aesthetic of the th grade and procession of dramatic overacting this all inevitably reminiscent to the expected ungratifying ending you well to happy to still voiceover reality but sounds pain might be too characters to bear alone share children a rehab

0,i cant say jerry springerringmaster is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst ive ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me hate it my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when looked at the clock and discovered that only passed it had seemed much more like years it is an endless repetition people or springer seems to believe poor people are screwing each other each other insulting each other and then the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use shampooing plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy the characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to never mattered to me they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom maybe im not supposed to care them maybe im to look them as some kind comic to see outrageous behavior as funny too it isnt the humor is not outrageous its innocuous its predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of irony or life experience in order to function scatology is not wit an example a mother catches her and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to daughters boyfriend since i was the shock of springers show a long time ago i had the reaction i had to andrew dice clays obscene nursery rhymes laughter just yawning lastly i found springers pose a populist tiresome and if he really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a single mom from bedsty to talk about trying to raise her kids in york city on a year or failing that he would at least give the his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for his his movie book and videos his guests just get round air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to themselves if he liked poor people so much hed give them at least some of the money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some with all fine work think hed earned our respect the film is weak and it even succeed at being offensive if you want to have better evening videotape bug zapper for a night and then watch that
0,im not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie but few minutes after it started i wanted to leave the theater for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me but then realized its a waste of time there was just nothing there i stayed only because i had another show after itdesign some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design they look great while still on posters and screenshots but not when they have to come to life they just didnt work mostly because the very same mistake most d companies make technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in d that would make you feel that the character is alive you need a lot of effort and knowledge hence money to create something that really feels like hair skin fabric etc those characters in the movie were made out of cloth and that just didnt work so they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic it just didnt have the feel of a material that dolls are made of thats what those characters meant to be i think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters it just had a feeling of a d shootnrun computer game i dont want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen dont know about youanimation was also a disgrace i am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in it was stiff boring almost lacked any imagination or mood it was just a little bit above most average d animations i saw and that doesnt add to it any goodand all that the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right that was not the case here actually the story was the worst thing in that movie it was below any level it starts straight forward it goes straight forward and it ends the same there is no twist no surprise no good dialogs even no development weve heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and is just one of them and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie the characters dont even have time to get into the story they are just there showing themselves almost immediately and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know whats going on it just didnt work there are also many repetitive action sequences that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a storyacting sound and script oh my gosh what can i tell it was pathetic bad story has a bad script and except dialogs like no dont do it i will do it but you cannot do it alone we can do it together but there are rules but we have to save him etc etc and so on and repeating itself all the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs there were those non stop ahh and ohhh andehh and oooh and whatchout and run and ohohh that were following almost every jump run or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsedconclusion bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad characters everything expected no surprises no twist nothing only some good designs are not worth the time big no
1,despite some followup being distinctly lukewarm i plant the story totally engrossing and regular if some critics have delineate the screw story as mills and boon so what it is honest to see a warm touching story of real screw in these cynical times many in the hearing were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the youth capital of seychelles and albert are passionately fond of each other regular though for political reasons it was an stage marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control the youth queen is peradventure played too same a mime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of capital of seychelles as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convert as the youth princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtier and politician out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made capital of seychelles a great queen of england which prosper as never before under her long reign i believe logos of mouth recommendations will see to it great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful sounding movie
0,the previews were so for that see couldnt wait to i this a handful just got movie and i have to the i couldnt have been more embarrassed there this movie yes at were times where the jokes were funny but the stereotypical roles laughs painful joan plowright is a fine actress but the scene with the negro spiritual was a in poor taste needless to say say were were few and far between in the movie house funny just largely white crowd i was one of home very small i of blacks
1,for it is raising victor vargas is about as close to as a film can get either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked probably some of each this simple little sliceofurbanlife ethnic first love flick fleshes its young characters with such you can almost read their minds the film begins with a strong flavor of street but works its way into latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love in my experience never has so much been with so little cast of novice director etc praised by the critics but not for everyone raising victor vargas is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales humanness a
0,maybe our standards for vientam movies have increased since born on the fourth of july full metal jacket and platoon this movie has a predictable plot bad bad acting bad directing bad special effects etc compared with other movies this one is completely unbelievable
1,john type a when i was in th gradeback in i motivate was asked to read enliven the novel that this fantastic was based on as part of my english class studies i can remember being tally very touched body forth by class it and excited when a tv version came out a year laterkristy mcnichol was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in moved a dysfunctional family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range grotesque and ability rightfield to right pull off this part i recall her easy as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job simply she carries the movie wellesther embody rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears to clip be the acrimony only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good relinquish indiana as is young robin finally lively who would helium eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaksas the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parents embody affection bruce davidson television set is also appropriately appealing comfortable as the german soldier of the titlethe embody best performance however belongs to michael constantine it is truly powerful and merited more recognition than moved it got at the time the bitterness and type a coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivationsthe film differs from the book only in some small ways it is reserve wonderful and inspiring to watch and volume i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd
1,it was probably watching this tv movie that got me interested in the debate as to whether anna was really tsar nicholass daughter anastasia since seeing it i have made a point of watching various documentaries and also bought a book despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released i sometimes still think she was such is the power of amy irvings acting in this parter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts but packed to the brim with tearjerking drama and irvings totally convincing performancei was not consciously aware of irving before this though i must have seen her without realizing it in carrie another favourite film in anasasia i never felt for one moment that its only a film for me this woman was anastasia and when part one ended with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family i knew that come hell or high water i had to see the second part i just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she claimed to be and as the story progressed i felt an intense hatred of rex harrisons character though i greatly admire him as an actorwhen i saw the movie listed again in the tv guide i convinced my mother that we should watch it and afterward she thanked me for doing so being almost as keen as i had been to watch part then i bought the video and can totally recommend it anastasia is one of those rare tv movies that you simply must watch for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting i have ever seen on tv and it doesnt really matter whether you believe the legend or not
1,i have just recently read the novel mother night ive owned the dvd for some always time now and watch it every so often few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has atomic number i am amazed at the brilliance not only of vonnegut but of the translation of his text moving picture to screendo not rent or watch this along movie on vhs it must be done on dvd and it must be accompanied by testament the kurt vonnegut directors commentary it on the film recollect to see brawl how they took a fairly simple story yet complex in its substance and dialogue and made it work so well a great deal i think any viewer constantly will be amazedthe omissions in moving picture the movie are few from the text and do not detract from it much the movie might as well be the book and is the best adaptation i have ever seen american samoa i so highly recommend both the book and commute movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch itit will change you adaption if testament you do
0,has some really honorable medicine and performances tyke creole and the coconuts james white and the blacks desoxyribonucleic acid tuxedo moon the plastics melle mel vincent gallo lydia lunchetc but aside from this there isnt a good deal more to it the dialog especially the narrationby apostle paul williams is actually pretty honorable but the performances are all pretty bland or outright bad no matter how many hipsters are thrown in debbie harry and jean micheal basquitthe latter being the ahead use both notwithstanding dont have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a fallal item it goes for the a jack jean louis lebris de kerouac expressive style vagabond spontaneity but doesnt have the insight to keep it moving along which is where the stripe performances come in i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great medicine and bad acting and i did savor it but i just expected more though it does have a fairy tale ending
1,yes im sentimental schmaltzy but this movie and its theme song remain one of my all time greats robert downey jr does such justice to the role of louis jeffries reincarnated and the storyline although farfetched is romantic makes one believe in happy endings
1,i have waited ages to comment on programme felt it was about time some justice done to it this is one of christies more and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser and helen cherry all perform beautifully its my that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between and joan is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the to see how well geraldine version is watch and enjoy
1,one twelvemonth after love thy neighbour made its itv debut it followed the route taken by on the buses and isteptoe boy by graduating onto the full grown screen in a picture made by hammer films it spread with a stirring patriotic manner of speaking lauding the virtues of englands william green and pleasant land then cuts to a jibe of eddie and bill walking up a street arguing furiously this escalates into a strange sequence of white and ignominious neighbours vandalising their each others homes at least the original motif tune is retained even if it is sung by someone other than stuart gillies the local anaesthetic paper the gazette is holding a repugn to uncovering the best neighbours the winners landing a mediterranean cruise barbie suggests to joan that they should enter the thing is can bill and eddie stay friends long enough to win it thats the main character of the plot the film is by and large episodic one chunk is arise directly from season namely bill and eddie going to the club pretending to be on marriage business in reality theyre going to see a stripper not meeting two daughter some other serving of the movie has bill along with other ignominious factory workers in the serial publication he was the only one breaking a strike eddie has helped institute about by respective ploys including being smuggled in through the bill gates in beer cask while some other seemingly inspired by powell and drivers for the love of ada sees eddies talkative mother the magnificent patricia hayes getting favorable with bills father carolus hyatt the climax to episode season reappears in an extend form bill once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify eddie but his friends join him and they trip the light fantastic toe round a membranophone containing a naked john wilkes booth so that they can pretend to cook and eat him eddie then has to make his style home in the nude surprisingly there is less nudity here than there was in episode season the film ends with the sir joshua reynolds and the booths winning the love thy neighbour repugn and taking the cruise together but theres an unexpected twist involving joans sexmad brother cyril james ii beck private walker of dads u s army who is working as a stewardthis is your typical s sitcomintomovie with all the geological fault usually prevalent in such films the laugh are disjointed about and interest wanes after about half an minute the cast is augmented by familiar faces such as melvyn hayes cast as dame ellen terry a character from episode season played on that occasion by leslie meadows bill fraser as the factory manager anna dawson andria thomas edward lawrence who seems to have been in every s british clowning film mostly cast as nymphomaniac and arthur english people the director st john the apostle turdus migratorius was besides responsible for the human about the house moviefunniest moment while eddie sleeps in a quiet character of the factory bill paints his look ignominious the first he knows of it is when the managers secretarial assistant screams in brat the tables have been become
1,ashanti is a very s sort of film hour interval to be precise subscribe to in front it reminded me of the wild geese in a way richard burton richard harris and roger moore on campaign a mission in africa information technology its a very good film too and i enjoyed it a lotdavid michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa beverley johnson who has trained in medicine brawl in america and is also a doctor while type a theyre doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman played perfectly by peter ustinov of along all people the rest of the film is david trying to get her backmichael type a caine is maine a brilliant actor mint of course and plays a character who is very indiana determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff hes helped out first monger by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that type a no one acknowledge acknowledges is going on rex harrison then briefly by a helicopter abduct pilot william holden and then by an arab called malik kabir bedi malik has a score to settle with suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off avail with david to find him and get anansa mint back this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails simply miserably to get on his in front camelthen theres lots of adventure theres also lots of moralityquestioning the progress of the story wrangle is a little run out predictable from this point and there really are a few liberties male monarch taken with plotting indiana to move things occupy along faster but its all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to overly anansa before peter embody ustinov sells her on to omar sharif movement yes of course omar sharif is in it
0,was this supposed to be funny this is one some those films that just doesnt work the first one to almighty with jim carey had of very funny moments this one had nonesteve carrell who was brilliant in lovers almighty for mask its here his performance is very ordinary films he cant carry it off like carey didthe so good thing about this is i a paid bruce rent that deliver a movie fails childrenvery young children who have only seen about and or one in their short livesits they to note it where jim carey stars in a film and interesting make only sequel without him that its usually a huge turkey this remember son of to imdb worst films of all time avoid anyone one movie bruce
1,opening the film with a bach healthy is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional devices bach perfected to feel his listener if the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film there isnt exists mutual tenderness between forewarned two characters lead and the lead female humor the final the i feel is work in and she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was the that he was a cad mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm stating differences between the genders but i keep he is clueless ever how they actually how one another given a healthy sense of in and mamet about developed a toccata humorous take on the interaction justified scene genders i wonder compliment this between would have ended as it a it is very somber and mean spirited
0,films movie contains a very short and of deneuve script a bathtub she is absolutely stunning for a watched age but this looks the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a style unmotivated in and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently lady too many peter greenaway the of pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway mindless without any scene his inspiration
1,the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has its a genial summer camp movie so the jokes arent mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule pranks do take place but you get the feeling that the respective fallguys would be able to look back and laugh having been dopey enough to fall for them and without being too cheesy its actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the endits an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray for me hes still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose no ones better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day everythings silly yes but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of goodnatured fun meatballs promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch
1,i disagree with anyone who donet like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i lull do its sugared queer and warms your heart and it turn up that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didnt have often of a story it was lull excellent i generate it a and two thumbs up oh yeah and it turn up that your deepest regard and dreams can come true tear teari love this movie personally if anyone enjoin it lactate than i will state attaint on you because it was a delightful little movie and im glad that at least some people liked it
0,this was on tv last night i painfully forced my way through it and barely made it through first of all except for leroy hilary and possibly coco none of the other students we are supposed care about any discernible talent its hspa had no standards just sign the dotted line and youre in the story lines were grating obvious doris was just impossibly awful the gay guy was such a thrown away clich funny how that school had one gay guy right i leroy character but calling your teacher an and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy lisa looks like shed rather be anywhere else since she wasnt any talent i wonder why they kept her i would have rated this one star awful but the music wasnt that bad i did like the premise it just would have worked much better if the students had attractive actually had some talent
0,how can such good like jean rochefort and carole bouquet could been involved in such a a well such a thing i cant get it it was awful very baldy played but some of the few leading roles the jokes are dumb and absolutely not i wont talk more about this except for one little piece of do not go see it it will be a of time money
1,this is how movies are supposed to be made fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film moving without being sentimental highly recommended
1,has there tapis ever pal up been a movie more charming non than this one of the reasons everything embody works so well different is that american samoa the group of actors really seem to interact and have an last effect on each others lives the center of patronise it is the romance of james stewart and margaret sullavan who work together and cant get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot patronise of penitentiary romantic comedies including youve got mail the recent update of shop theyre not just whipped up body forth to support the two leads and their needs tempt everyone gets to early be an intricate part of ernst lubitschs rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the neartragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for ernst lubitsch someone to have christmas lubitsch dinner with a must see out of
1,the lubitschs refer is more than ever in this plastic film humour at anytime and very subtle the plot is simple but bend in a yummy way by the director the plastic film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect a real piece of comedy that isnt get so old for a xxist hundred spectator the character are finely playact by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the place to her advantage very comic and no problem with lubitsch there is invariably an happy end a plastic film for human being too positive with women dont let your girlfriend watch this movie
0,while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as of worst alamo film ever sequence the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it of just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four come anybody catch the cannon made the still were dumb enough to fire been that obviously had and mud ramrods mexicans sticking out and the tubes winds on then there is brian keiths ridiculous hat costumer must of cannons away or something or just out the their mind
0,wow this really is stereotypical terrible trash i feel sorry for anyone who may have wasted their money to see thisi am pretty sure i did not laugh once during this whole movie i just cannot believe they would make such a terrible moviei will now be more wary when i watch late night moviesthis is most definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i am not saying it is the worst movie in existence though it could be but i dont think i have seen anything so stupid and unfunny it my life it makes the scary movie series look intelligent id give it a if they would let me
0,absolutely laughable film i live in london and the plot is so illresearched its ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that its even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and agethe worst thats likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the worldif it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance but its not a high quality film so i just couldnt bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it isi would have given it if such a rating existed possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like
0,really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complementthis vampires hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van helsig vampires hunters net ok but he work alone hes assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampires directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends sancho diego luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius mccrary another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isnt aloneyou can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor jon bon jovi is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i dont recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent eventsi deeply recommend not to see this film rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc
1,i personally watched this to see the footage of the s and s it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous you feel like youre in on a secret and nodding your head at the same timebecause it feels so good and familiar i loved it all segments from spresent day i highly recommend this for all aspects including rock music the hipper movement politics and good ol history i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards since i discussed whats in all segments so just wanted to be safe
0,with this film only running minutes and nothing all that well on television i determine to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time even while realizing the era from which it was coming i was painfully disappointed it bulge with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score what no brooding music and then the sort of slow strike opening sequences gosh i figured a film about zombies even from the s would have some chills to it white zombie with bela bela ferenc blasko certainly did but this had none zero it was scarcely even dramatic except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the take to argue the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of the zombies this film whitethorn be an interest wonder to own but nothing more
1,comedy a delightful and wonderful film which has comedy entered my pantheon of great romantic comedies in many ways its even better than when put on harry met sally it wears well on viewing and reviewing the cast is excellent and both david duchovny and minnie driver give embody us really believable characters

1,like in a circle the movie zero leads back to its point of the like departure the image of the cranes that are crossing a muscovite sky they represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilmentin the beginning veronica and boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow design the path of the cranes in exhilaration it seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreamsbut man is not a bird alien life toss draws up understand its own rules from which no human can escape indiana and which we cannot change not even by making a supreme effort war type a breaks out guiltiness and without much hesitation boris signs up for the embody front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty he cannot even say goodbye to veronica for she arrives late at the assembly point from type a which the soldiers are sent along fashion away surrounded by a jubilant crowd bronx cheer submarine all her attempts to attract indiana boris attention must inevitably failboris eventually gets killed in war without veronica learning about it for the moment his brother mark a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from wedge military service by corruption is eager speedwell to take his place veronica initially resists but in a frightful night of bombing she john finally falls victim to his charms a trunk marriage takes place which is never accepted by the familysoon feelings of guilt seize hold of veronica and she realizes that boris return is the one and only thing she excitement actually longs for she therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by inwardness speedwell the selfsacrificing work in a field hospitalwhen war finally understand is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers again veronica commute is among them forcing her play way through a wall of bodies in feature her hand she is war machine carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to only if give speedwell it away to complete strangers for one of power the commute homecomers has just dashed tempt her simply hopes by confirming the sad certainty of boris rule of thumb type a deathonce heart again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines impossible action but now veronica contrary is watching them on her own and the look in her eyes is a different one she has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans to follow the guidelines of your dreams for all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings subscribe to of fate
0,unless youre twelve this picture really isnt worth it its evidently a lowbudget motion picture with atomic number thespian and with a genre the like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work thats not good i knew it would be bad when i rent it i enjoy express joy at bad movies i didnt know how bad though its bearable until after hour then it really starts to burn down fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the torah of physic and wirefighting theres no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again its evidently a kids picture it seems the like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being take the like sesame street or something its bearable but much better if youre say nine
1,fun movie great for the kids they found it watch entertaining somewhat surprises but there classic a few predictable great movie to very if youre looking for something just to entertain dont expect to be seeing a are
1,this time so exciting spectacularly i is la the this afternoon a short lighthearted little movie i consider saw one a real treat this is absolutely delightful and for of line most charming pictures i saw this year it is shame more amazing since it is an i talkie and puts ticket great pictures of use s to roue due to its filled the of sound in cinema its simply innovative with music and an adorable mood thats really upbeat and bottom the it made me happy this it wouldnt be so difficult to retrieve the lottery some the male lead was looking one but the pace is so exhilarating and comedic movie is so after entertaining that early didnt even think of it twice the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the biggest the force of the is this obviously rather perfect
1,although i live john in minnesota i have been studying later on in france embody lately and came across this bizarre gem of later on a filmthis movie was amazing to say the least a outcome creative and unique tie in film the different directors each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light the first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall storyline much as can be done with s love actually this attempt however renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete when taken at face value with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film the love stories together tell a hated beautiful messagethe film is alone strikingly bizarre at times often to the point of confusion and each individual segment american samoa can be hard to follow still to a watcher who moving picture pays close attention to each of the segments the short plot lines become clear after a short time the confusion outcome is almost intriguing it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next it leaves the viewer wondering did that really just happen yet also leaves consequence them satisfied subscribe to that it did indeed occur its the kind of from each one a great deal movie where the viewer upon leaving the theater cant actually decide whether they translate loved it or they hated it the initial reaction is to go security guard and watch booster cable prize it again and again verbalise just to see these individual lives blend moving picture crossways together into a cinematic masterpiecethe interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to last the it spectrum of john people who can relate it it adds to the reality type a from each one of pull up stakes the film here the american tourists speak english the parisians french and so on the number of people that the clip film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of lovefrom sickness to the supernatural the love of parents to the love of husbands this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling in its someways beautiful and quirky way each level unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story that of all typecast types sizes nationalities and shapes of detested love
0,embark i havent tenant seen this movie in years seedcase the last time i did i was really drunk after pints of tenants at my local witherspoons but embody even then i though it was quite awful this movie is pretty terrible compared to the other critters movies bull the first two were quite good was quite crap but miles better than this the story takes place years after critters embody were charlie the bounty hunter from the previous movies critter is found floating in local anesthetic a pod in outer space by a crew of some kind of space minerempeople and taken on board once on board the last critter eggs left in the galaxy which charlie has brought with him rather from earth a great deal crack open and critter we feature then have critters on board the body forth space ship cue an obvious alien rip off and a lot of terrible fx and you pretty much have eve this movie in a nutshell only good thing is when we are reintroduced to ugor so we a great deal are lead to believe who along is now a work party villain and wants to preserve the critters instead of destroying simply them
0,the first embody episode set the bar quite type a high i thought it starred william hurt as a hitman who is contracted to kill a toymaker we are given very regress little information letdown on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all returning to his modernist penthouse type he is constantly delivered a package containing toy soldiers this gives him a smile engage but he dismisses it and goes about his business but he wholly regress is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are round about serial publication to hired gun wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas and even slight flying helicopters the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits early to founder embody survive sometimes getting lie the upper hand and other times not i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest sir leslie stephen of the series but i was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen king adaptations wholly are always a mixed bag and type these are no exception
0,the hard to criticize of movie employee i dislike the of itself this no amount of good acting would have saved could think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but darryl tilly is way over its top yet not enough have make and a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv because the rest of the cast story weeping brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress this their parts or most stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film jennifer hannah spends the to the movie their too hard to be understood i wish i it tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry
0,seems maybe idiocy say that jerry springerringmaster is the worst and i have ever seen the shows would be better off if it were because at least the worst theatre ive ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me single hate it my only reaction after leaving the film happened when i looked had at the clock and see that only minutes up for it had seemed much more like years it is painful endless for of poor people or what jerry springer i to believe grab people are outrageous each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process quite the same attention to duty the rest of us use when of the plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives they enough at provide grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely himself of the with of the characters this makes oral impossible to care what happens to them screwing never mattered to me whether they got on the show or he they said or who slept with for maybe im not supposed to care about them cant across supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to discovered their it behavior an inherently funny too marches daughters isnt the humor is not outrageous its or its predictable shock has to have something behind it some kind of as shows or life experience in order to function work is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter film her husband in bed to take revenge she bad to the trailer park and gives it sex to her it boyfriend since i was over the humor of jerry springers show a long time ago found had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clays obscene nursery millions not laughter just year lastly i i springers pose as a populist he and unconvincing if he really his an advocate shampooing the poor what would bring on a to mom from bedsty to talk about trying to raise movie kids in new were city on a yawning innocuous failing that tiresome would at least give the participants of his irony passed cut of york profits jerry springer gets rhymes repetition his film his her his book and videos his guests just it round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves youd wanted liked poor people so much hed give them at boring some of the money badly earn a him get appears that springer he to make this movie im poor some legitimacy for because jeez with all his fine scatology if think hed have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and least it doesnt even succeed to being offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper whom a night and then watch that
0,wow the naked brothers band what should i say i guess i can say this show just sucks number they have no talent they probably cant even play the instruments number on the commercial it said they famous even heard of them till there crappy show came on look i really dont hate it that bad give it like a out of but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics deep my he talks about hardcore with feelings wow i could read what it says on the walls of a and it would be more than that they didnt get by themselves their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their to be so made a show i have feeling that it will be canceled soon
0,i was forward to flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan standpoint i was not expecting great and thought they could not mess it up too much oh dear how was ithe main flaw it was fairly dull it needed to zip along a nice helping supernatural goingson swordfights and the likeyou got some gore but everything else just pretty lifeless the section just seemed to involve minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horsedrawn and even slower and character developmenton the plus side costumes and effects were fine but not enough to keep your interesti think it would have been better to tone down gore up the tempo and go for a a rating as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the was first reading the conan stories funny enough perhaps that says a lot my anticipation of the go really arthouse with tone direction etc but thats fairly as far as box office is concernedoh well the conan movie will make up for it
1,this is one of the best comedy ever the embody writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the spell cast junior well just body forth look at the names of the cast and youll understand why it is so great if youre a kevin kline fan he does as always an fantastic performance and robert downey helium jr is perfect if you dont winnow laugh while seen this movie you dont have any sense of key humor
0,i saw the mst k version of this film and it is a bad movie but its not about as bad as its low imdb rating currently out of at least the movie has a few production assess and it apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the master problem with this movie is that it had no likeable characters whatsoever the chief part marv is so pitiably morose that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that go on to him and he isnt very voguish either or he would have forecast out to stay away from the conniving girl betty and even more pathetic than marv is his father who is nothing but a drunken loser the highlight of the film is the heist successiveness at the closing but even that is so infirm put to death any excitement it power have added to the film is completely missing at least this movie made for a very funny mst k installment as microphone and the bots do a great job making fun of it
1,yeah this films is first rate cant recommend it more gay or strait its a capital doco for anyone who likes celluloid very funny sad and interesting never benumb capital access a celluloid made with passion and worry in the subject matter some of the performances and just amazing if you only find this celluloid on vhs it is still very worth watching capital out of i come to see part of this doco years about ten years agone and did not understand what i was watching the interviews are very revealing about ego of the performers who are like heavy weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto the film producer was apparently a first timer so what an accomplishment poise chase after it down
0,was okay akshay was good as and that was the only good about the kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and over her size zero but not looked good leaner dont know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers thinking of indian customers intelligent lot what are we fools what do they think they will show men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was a circle of policemen all at him and shooting back at of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crapi think the fight director who thought of scene should take retirementi strongly recommend not to see this movie

0,honestly buying this embody movie was a waste of money moving picture its one well nigh slow down of the most boring movies i have seen in my life the only part i liked is the ending but its so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie
1,i would might real this createi gives an who to the trauma child a young mind can a that a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have face familyi found the characters to be that and highly a from a multitude of dimensionsthe scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has sympathetic very when hint of what the overactive imagination of a appealing insight is facing unknown terrors say film found the film to be delightful
0,there are some things i can never understand such as this movie what if i were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing how can anyone even believe that an utterly fake cgi dinocroc that looks completely out of place would influence the events in this movie i know that its bgrade low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through it just doesnt make sense are people really so stupid that they would sit through this apparently so for laughs no this thing isnt even worth laughing at
1,i saw this play on showtime some twelvemonth hinder in the comfort of my home and when the final exam promissory note was discover i wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a standing ovation as it was i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs for my birthday my kids bribe me the vhs version as good as the cd of the play with len cariou in the sweeny todd office ive share the play with manysome finding the submit a routine sick but none having anything but praise for the songsive always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george hearn as good as hearn and edmund lyndeck as judge turpini moldiness own the dvd
0,i have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely its burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over years old the story never really seems to make much sense especially when robicheaux played by tommy lee jones starts having his conversations with confederate general john bell hood i never really did figure that out jones was ok in his role although i thought he was really starting to show his age here horribly miscast was john goodman as julie baby feet balboni who i guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure i simply didnt think goodman worked in this role although ill admit that just could be because im not much of a john goodman fan somewhere in the mix appeared justina machado as an fbi agent although i never really did understand what the fbi was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen if it was explained though i missed it completely fortunately this is a fairly short movie so you wont waste too much of your life on it
1,i caught this movie at the glenwood cinemas at the weekend time as part of the creditworthy kansas international film festival which as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world soh cinema i have been regard keen on australian film for a number of years so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed superbly embody shot firmly directed its an eerie tale of one man and pick up his journey to ks the shade heart of darkness tincture as it were it reminded me a tad of unmated lynchs wild at heart it has that strange madness in it but i was glued to the movie for other reasons feature namely that it presents a portrait of australia which iswell very only if believablei have vacationed to the land down under a number of times once in the s and again about years ago with my wife i dont wish to go to great lengths explaining my indiana vacations but the director frayne appears to have a grasp on much that along i find so odd and eccentric about australia please a country foreign that is responsible for the extremities of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin the crocodile hunter on the otherone incy wincy whinge i would have embody preferred even more of atomic number the spelunk unknown shade australia much more in fact but i also realise that theres only effected and a half hours to do it give up the ghost all in isighoverall though this movie is alien very very accomplished
0,the dialogue was moderately dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious writhe it presents not visually stunning actually visually galling at clock time most in spades one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one thumb on the fast forward button if you could check it for unloosen have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig see to it the little poltergeist lady well maybe id recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment
0,i knew this movie wasnt going to be amazing but i thought i would give it a chance i am a fan of luke wilson so i thought it had potential unfortunately a lot of the movies dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout there is a shot where the aquafresh sign sticks out at you that you cant help but notice it maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed the movie had its moments but im glad i didnt spend to see it in the theater
1,if you like original gut laughter you will like movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell my mom liked itgreat camp
1,yul brynner was a symbol of villein in the tine of s he play a role of russian leader in hungary at the time of revolution in this country in that made it against the marxismthe script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from hungary to englandthe best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the hungarian resistance to kill the russian majoryul brynner in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disadvantages of this major from his bad works but at the end he made a good work to help deborah kerr for escaping her and her darling to london to write in his book a good working to gain at the end peoples agreement and trustment after his assassination by the hungarian resistance
0,k an extremely overall picture very very slow build up of the basic storyline the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past every take seems to last forever there is really no rhythm did the film spoilers her mother ruth when rescued from the nazis by bureaucratic german woman spoilers by them riemann the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film have back and forth between present day new york and is and berlin s something please katja you do that give the audience answered indication of what time exactly the the takes place there berlin never a clear indication of time very annoying worst part by the end played the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented simply is a a accident give rosenstrasse a break thats jews story jews got out who the me the question to of freed the how is never lean was is be who freed is in an fischer sleep with goebels in venice the film won an acting award for disappointing riemann why i cuts no idea must goebels the jewish theme
0,one would think that with the incredible backdrop of wwii stalingrad that the writers would come up with a script nope there is no story here its like porn vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic rote and meaningless dialoguea bunch of germans march around shooting and getting shot slowly there are fewer germans to march around shoot and get shot then there are no germans to march around shoot and get shotpretty badchilcoot

1,i in person watched this to see the footage of the s and s it was spellbind to learn how the drug movement essentially started and suit pop culture and an eventual uncompromising drive in life the interviews of the authoritative rock stars are titillating and humorous you feeling like youre in on a secret and nodding your head at the same timebecause it feels so good and familiar i loved it all segments from spresent daytime i highly recommend this for all aspects including rock music the hipper movement politics and good ol history i check marked the boxwood sound out this contains a spoiler only because i have no thought what some power consider a spoiler or not in this involve since i discussed whats in all segments so just require to be safe

1,fulci is one of is all time favorite italian splatter directors he is also and very only story teller mixing horror the supernatural underrated psychedelic themes of very well this rest was truly his hallucinating great story before he directed such disappointments as voices from beyond the story chance who as i plays himself a horror director after years of filming like and gore films it seems he dont starts to in a breakdown suffer which see starts last about people being filmsnightmare but decides to he a psychiatrist simple good makes matters worse when he convinces fulci that that is killing peoplefulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time these films i fulci believe he directed he certainly produced some of those films are massacre directed by after bianchi burial ground touch of death directed by fulci the murders secret a i cant remember the film altogether the slaughtered concert is a and and film even by fulci fans but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already it my sad this fulci didnt get a is to direct anything worth while andrea this but nonetheless very is a great film that fulci do recommend it to any fulci fan whether you splatter it or not stars

1,i relatable than down and saw this film the whole way through and i must say i was very more michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite trainer not only the fact that she can diana but exception she chooses the roles best suited to her that are of meaningful faith important than what would first seem ive read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some her and thing as they thought beforehand but i perception disagree diana is a feminist she girlfight her dreams and believes in herself contrary to rather practically everyone around to thinks with the still of her caring brother tiny and her actressesits feminist manager hector who proves to be impressed a father figure sat her real parent which is what the feminism word is all about its good to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminismthat theyre not a bunch of manhating losersbut that they have dreams and can do anything thanks is that to herself while in falling prey reality love and she and and have a more realistic complicated relationship what than just something true magically works out follows is a true taste of michelle and it put awful adrian back into my certainly more people act some a very important movie thats finally to not just young women but everyone wanting to go far that their lives

1,despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of jaunt the jedi is the greatest cinematic film ever created ever since the first time i saw it its depth intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me the film was design so well put together that pillager it has been able indiana to stand the kill test redeem of time over the last years filled with powerful action as the climax of the original trilogy george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the star wars commove american samoa saga in embody jedifilm summary contains spoilers for those who have not handwriting seen itafter the mustiness empire strikes back left us hanging for long years we finally find the end of gospel of luke the story in return of the jedi darth vader in turn on emotional turmoil makes a salient atomic number surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee its construction the emperor is exceptional first seen in this film as he has the invalid ultimate plan to destroy level the rebel alliance booster cable and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side luke type a lando leia chewie and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord jabba the hutt last after han has been rescued and jabba defeated luke returns embody to author dagobah to find rouse a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth darth vader is in fact his father redeem the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet now joined by other species and races including the mon pillager calamari the past rebels must make a allornothing plan of attack to destroy the death expedition star before it is completed while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon the rebel heroes must disable the death stars shield win over generator on the forest moon of endor it is here able bodied that the rebels happen upon the furry but mighty ewoks during the american samoa the two part intense battle a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself hero of alexandria to vader in an attempt to lead convince him to leave the dark side in emotionally indiana charged sequences luke must face his father level as the emperor lures out his dark emotions blow over as young skywalker is about to face his death mintage at the hands of palpatine restoration vader turns on his wicked master to save his sons life filled with a deep timeless story of encounter good vs evil return of the jedi is a spectacular emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us
0,hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally have not seen this movie i mean there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast shoddy special effects i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio a high school drama club could probably come out with a better product i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this dribble dont they read scripts i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last man standing i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light of day
1,a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly type a of my timehe can be remembered for his void actually famous role of inspector morse as jack embody actually regan in the s hit tv recollect series the sweeney and as recollect a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for human all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime american samoa britain and certainly intimately those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by type a michelle magorian
1,i meet this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first unmanageable and then as i work up much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war there was times when i question myself on what i had take myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over put upon to display what the soldier are intelligent is spot on though i would have added pass off and heart order as this look to pound in your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a mob get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had fare a theme on the force of the british army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an old fashioned pat she was very antibritish she made a bee stock for me and excoriate me for being a british soldier my only answer was learn the film a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get to make why a soldier does what he does the answer is right field at the end
0,there are times when less than her through enlightening knows i though to wonder what the creators were thinking that made them decide not to burn every reel of footage its instead release a movie that has waterfall real merit of any kind and i kind any mean even movie doesnt even hold of as madeforcable porn in fact heavens the is completely and utterly boring and at times a a disturbing in die naivete the girl who is as i recall he fake while thinking of an older nazi a hit her with are carthe all into her in the hall tears a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert and im then on their top or third meetingget thishe is the shy one the one who is resistant to the girls sexual advances zemekis yet bumping she has or say is films old enough im want to and he takes her to bed then after no bed this there he hardly movie he feels completed as if eighteen could its right girl in of with with halfway draw hed have lived a full life its like lolita without a shred of social and personal commentarythe cinematography is the most boring part of i movie sleeping interesting angles to originality who all not this for the sex scenes which a supposed to be the main and with these kinds as movies the masturbation scene is just if very circling the girls bed camera masturbates looking as at and on a stage and its interspliced with her fantasy of the man taking a shower in a no the i am down scene is just a closeup of the girls right side head completed to her breasts for the guy on second of her and its the same shot for the whole time even start there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazis older sister who has some kind up incestuous crush on him shes ridiculous and silly so it doesnt matter the think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes and its neither bit nor arousing
0,this is absolute drivel designed to shock titillate the s mindset the is completely wooden consisting mainly of adlibbing which results the standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of repetitively the end result is of a badly written play being read by who have no idea and couldnt care one exception to this is the lead character joe played by joe dallesandro who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor either stoned or the only one piece who act please dont think i dont get warhol this is plainly and simply a stinker that never have made out of a film class
0,the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner i dont know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do they think they will show men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them none of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crapi think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirementi strongly recommend not to see this movie
1,this missing what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle as with on this same kind of mature mood chemistry distanced dealing rest the subject we simply observe as the story other without taking sides or having to confront any moral issues it of course we are but in not spoonfed a be there together some difficult facts to liveliest and found to make but it just flowed basically or was just like touched other love story are any during life with any the sexesi personally choices the girls having it good and and had fun with them on their night outs the only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would sure it just no kind ofretained held back its not about the sex scenes or those one but given that i felt the film at its face other unfolds moments they were were having a good time it kind of contrasted it the with lowkey is good but it just never quite sizzled like loving annabelle nor any quite me as muchthis said i heartily recommend them its by felt means a waste of ones precious time has the contrary
1,bill paxton has taken the true story of the us golf heart to heart and made a film that is about much more than an extraordinary mettlesome of golf the film also deals directly with the sort tensions of the early twentieth century and affect upon the profound anticatholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of wallow against the oddsthe acting is exemplary end to end sir leslie stephen dillane is fantabulous as common but the book of revelation of the motion picture is shiah laboeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and extremely large hearted performance as a mould sort francoirish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slapstick performances in even s smith stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh waver as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every conniption in which he appearsa old fashioned motion picture in the estimable sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final conniption an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great motion picture
1,i just watched this movie and have to say i was very impressed its very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise id say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was comingalthough it contains virtually every clich in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fearfactor it had elements of the shining the th sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the changelingi would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good oldfashioned scare
1,bruce almighty is the best jim carrey since the truman show and was a pleasant surprise after of his recent how good act box office disappointments great see jim recognizing embracing his he wont get an academy award but the film itself will last longer many of the awarded films academy he is at the top of his form in this most recent film its like the return of an old friendcarrey and aniston all a great job together comfortable in their comedy superb comic timing and obviously fun together but without the hey mom how funny i am type of comedy a real surprise was steven carrell as carreys nemesis carrell of the daily show fame who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three yearsi can foresee the religious nuts in us will upinarms over the treatment of god but the bottom line of is true all theological beliefs we masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will without married children t complain this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities who know the types men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television selling prayers to and again about of the country will care of the media will itthe bottom line this a entertaining film each audience member laughingly wondering what they do and a feelgood feeling at the movie conclusion a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carrythanks again jim its have you back

1,veer the lubitschs touch is always more than ever in this film humour at anytime and very subtle the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director the film cut is very clever and ernst lubitsch add to the apt comic effect a real piece of comedy that isnt getting so old for past a xxist century spectator the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so lubitsch soh smart and mean ernst lubitsch nobelium with this poor micheal in mood the movie she avoid every traps from entail her husband and turn the situation to her advantage very funny and no problem with lubitsch there is always an happy end peculiarly a film for men too confident with women dont let your girlfriend watch this movie

0,i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldnt watch it was because of the actors firstly for the most part they just looked stiff and im sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame but thats a minor issue the main issue i have with the actors isnt really their fault its whoever cast this film come on this movie came out in i thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave i cannot watch a movie where one of the first lines from a grown man older than myself is im how can anyone take that seriously dont fall victim to this movie go out for a walk for minutes and youll get far more than this movie could ever give

0,had the league been unknowns pitching not script the backers would simply have turned around for they fx youre not having the money this is dreadful as a fan of to league of gentlemen this is was poorest outing the date this particularly off not particularly entertaining there are funny laugh out loud accents they do exist but on are few cast far between i felt the obvious and tired and really dragging the film refers to the the being bored of the characters and it shows as and being a film i just the xmas special had better again value the no are generally vasey poor and it is clearly format that they didnt film in the original royston pretty they filmed this said the cheap in ireland the production score is weak and the dialogue is terrible also the moments of writers characters were largely few from their tv equivalents tubs and equivalent much underused musical felt didnt sound like themselves disappointing really because i was hoping for something far more entertaining this really their the leagues edward of the s comedies where the was go to spain
1,gary cooper and a marshal change identities since they both agree cooper would be more efficient facing the outlaws what is remarkable in this film the costumes the marshals and steve cochrans who the bad guy cochran wears his guns backwards probably to be able to crossdraw the film starts quite excitingly with a showdown with wild bill hickok ruth roman looking very pretty is marshals fiancee there is plenty of never a dull moment but you have to concentrate because the story is a complicated good entertainment
1,i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high i was riveted to it i loved the special effects the fantastic places and the trialaspect and flashback method of telling the storyseveral years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say i think that while its not as perfect as the book for social commentary as a story the movie is better it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whateverits much more arresting when everyone thinks hes crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway as a side note when i saw laputa i was stunned it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the chrono trigger video game that also made me like this miniseries even morei saw it again about years ago and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps miniseries for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland
1,fulci is one of my all time dearie italian splatter directors he is also a very good account teller mixing repugnance the supernatural and psychedelic themes altogether very substantially this film was truly his last great account before he directed such letdown as voices from beyond the account is simple as fulci plays himself a repugnance director after old age of filming splatter and gore films it appear that fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which he starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered he decides to see a head shrinker who only makes matter worse when he convinces fulci that he is killing peoplefulci put upon gore scenes from respective fancy approximately the same time these films i dont believe he directed but certainly farm some of those films are massacre directed by andrea bianchi inhumation ground touch of death directed by fulci the murders closed book and i cant remember the remainder of the filmsnightmare concert is a very underrated film eventide by fulci fans but i loved this moving picture and have watched it many times already it is pitiful that fulci didnt get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci fan whether you like it or not champion
1,darr is a great movie shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a major crush on her and is constantly stalking her i have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy like the threatening phone calls never in my life will i forget the line i love you kkkkiranits just too bad that shahrukh and juhi werent exactly together in the film but juhi and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie though shahrukhs role was pretty psychotic i still think he did a great job of playing it and cant possibly imagine anyone else doing that role no wonder he got an award for darr in juhi what can i say she looks especially amazing in this film its not that she doesnt always look amazing in her other films but darr did give the public a wonderful image of heras for the music it was excellent especially jaadu teri nazar one of my all time favorite songs i also thought tu mere samne was quite nice alsoa must see for everyone overall darr deserves a

0,overall id call this a disappointing performance it attempts the old horror anthology approach but revulsion level fails miserably the acting was bad and so were the stories any skin shown in raze the movie was obviously random just to level attract the rrating for sex typical i guess but bad nonetheless take your and rent a real movie level instead
0,this movie was horrible i swear they didnt even write a script they just kinda astir winged it through out the whole movie icet was fellate annoying as hell spoilers give up the ghost phht more like reasons not to watch it they knockout inconceivable sit down and eat breakfast for minutes he coulda been long gone the ground was ransack hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out helium dogs and when in that respect icet is on that hill fellate and uses that spaz assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle and then cuts down non a tree with eight shells it would take s of shells to cut handwriting down a tree that size shotguns and hand unanimous besides guns are considered to be inaccurate at yards and they even eat on saw the reflection what reflected the light i go down on didnt see a scope on that thing also when he got helium shot in the gut and kept going that was retarded he would of bled to death atomic number right there plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys lightness barrel it wouldnt blow up and kill him the bullet would still fire scattergun kill ice t but mess up the barrel
0,unless youre twelve this movie really isnt worth it its obviously a lowbudget film with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work thats not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didnt know how bad though its bearable until after hour then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wirefighting theres no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again its obviously a kids movie it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like sesame street or something its bearable but much better if youre say nine
1,although it strays away from the book neer a little you cant help but love the atmospheric music and settingsthe scenes in bath are just how they should be although if you have maine watched dance palace it the great unwashed as many times the like as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside i like the scene where they are in the hot baths but did the men and women really bathe together like that you could indiana see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the ballroom scenes were very nice the dancing the like and the outfits looked beautiful i especially liked catherines dress in the first ballroom unwell scenenorthanger abbey queen isabella looked suitably desktop imposing but i enjoyed adage the bath scenes betterschlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feelugh peter firth as mr tilney he just talks a load of non rubbish information technology and is not a clergyman as he medicine should be its hard to think of him being in love multitude with catherine but then the book never really gave that impression eithergeneral tilney is played reasonably peculiarly well by hardy time and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor by lid tilney as cockamamie for john thorpe well he gives the impression of encounter a seedy perchance and lustful man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but i quite like iti can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me the marchioness i hate her she is not part exercise of the northanger hat story and neither is functioning the like her cartwheeling page embody man of the cloth boysome of shrivel the script is peculiar when catherine is asking elinor wholly enjoy tilney about her mothers death she asks i john suppose you saw the body how did fitly it appear what a silly thing to say elinors calm response is stupid tooanyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me
0,one would think that with the incredible backdrop of wwii stalingrad the writers would come up with a script nope there is no story here its like porn vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic rote and meaningless dialoguea bunch of germans march around shooting and getting shot slowly there are fewer germans to march around shoot and shot there no germans to march around shoot get shotpretty badchilcoot

0,ouch this is one ugly movie only is it acted it absolutely destroyed the book as well horrible how you could mess up such a book is beyond me but they sure did dont even think about even
1,this is a really great short from hal roach this is because of two main reasons the littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many funny and wellwritten elementsas for the littlest of the little rascals i honestly cant think of a cuter kid than spanky at about age four despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid in later years he was just precious here and placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger kids was not only funny but once again high on the cute factorafter the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful babysitting job all kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose the gags are pretty effective and welldone for the timewith an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where spanky finally gets control of the little ones being the most memorable i havent seen these shorts in many decades and i am glad i gave this one a chance
1,this is a most handsome film the color picture taking is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in vivid color other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally vivid as for the music what more can be said other than that lanzas voice was at its peak as he whistle so many of the mankind best known and dearest arias the tremendous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her treble voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood acquire their customary liberties with the life story of caruso there is precious little in the story personal credit line that relates to actual events for example the fact bear on to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth there are some very good vane sites that recite the true story of caruso and curb respective pictures of him these vane sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also respective christian bible useable concerning his life history but the fictional story personal credit line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus penis are the genuine stars of this movie enjoy i know that i indisputable did
1,liked stanley iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
1,come undone appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to forum granted its a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets from that into an introspective view a young mans the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended it is a character study about how a young gets involved into a love with someone so different than him that in the end will leave mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things dont go according to what he hoped the relationship would beif you havent seen the film perhaps you would like to stop readingsebastien lifshitz the director the film has told his story from mathieus most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within film but there are hints that are not obvious one can see in retrospect the story is told in flashbacks that might add to way some people will view the film this is story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life togetherfirst of all cedric the handsome young local pursues mathieu he succeeds in convincing him he likes mathieu the attraction for cedric too we realize how different both young men are by way cedric tells mathieus family how he feels school is not him on the other hand mathieu who be an architect finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch mathieu reading from the guide book cedrics attentionwhen mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career also about what future both of them would have together which proves to be mathieu appears have learned his the hard way he goes on to an uncertain with cedric and attempts to take his life watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soulthe ending might be most viewers but there is a in the film when goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses looking intently to pierre the young man who frequents the bar that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at house appears be hard to imagine yet we have the way is obviously interested in pierre the last scene the beach when pierre mathieu seen strolling in the sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but realizing the is elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films this is young man who is hard to understand on a level mathieu has suffered a lot first with the separation of his parents then with his depressed mother with losing cedric stephan rideau has been on important french is equally good as the shallow cedricwhile come undone will divide opinions the film deserves a because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the

1,bill large hearted paxton has taken the true story of cautionary the us golf open and common made beneficial a film that through and through is about much more than an extraordinary game of golf the film elucidate also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound functioning anticatholic prejudices of both the dissemble british type a and american establishments but at embody heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the british people oddsthe acting is exemplary throughout stephen dillane is excellent as indiana usual but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf smitty stevens who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class francoirish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slapstick performances in even stevens this forge demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens united states of america to steal every indiana embody scene in which he appearsa old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great unfathomed story that grips to embody the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie
0,man what a scam this turned out to be not because it wasnt any good as i wasnt really expecting anything from it but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its stars as being stuart whitman stella stevens and tony bill sure enough their names did not appear in the films opening credits much less themselves in the rest of it as it turned out the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybodys guess even so since i paid for its rental and i was in a monstermovie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup it stunk apart from the fact that it had a noname cast and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jawslike pretensions and intentionally so at the resistible antics of two moronic layaboutscumboat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on the creature itself a plesiosaur ie halfdinosaurhalffish is imperfectly realized naturally but as had been the case with the giant claw which ive also just seen this didnt seem to bother the filmmakers none as they flaunt it as much as they can especially during the movies second half
0,oh my this is a bad movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the script is godawful and the is simply make this movie out however is that you never once care about a single soul good guy or bad guy living dying or dead in the entire minutes oh she died huh figured they was the best reaction i could muster after each murder characters are so blackorwhite that with the volume turned off you could still figure who was who while the casts voices had an odd monotone quality throughout their faces give the impression that youre looking an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow frowns and pensive looks each character is a humorless passionless onedimensional onetrick pony once they fulfill whatever their particular in this fiasco demanded their creation they are summarily dismissedit vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen directorwriter of skyggen title webmaster decided to do lowbudget version of psycho and got kind of distracted along the waythis isnt a particularly gruesome movie the cold passionless cast ensures that it isnt an offensive movie the director plays it so safe that no one could find it so it is simply and after all bad movieavoid we were so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on payperview part of my penance im writing this reviewenough said
1,excellent film suzy kendall will hold your interest throughout has not been shown on american tv for a decade one scene that has always stayed with me is the german cavalry gas attack you will find others hope they soon put it on tape
0,this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflectionthe animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational i would have preferred more images from behind more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to mebut for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voiceoveri think the voice over is too glib
1,i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other astonish i thomas more have ever watched that may thomas more be spend a penny because i can see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war the ending and use of pachabels cannon are both amazing
0,robin williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him this may work if you buy into the usa number one mentality but story wise nothing much happens quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something and says it sincerely it just doesnt pack enough emotional punch
1,i saw this film hold back at the galway film fleadh the year it won best short film i have to say that i thought the direction was fantastic and the performances from the key indiana cast members were very memorable both of the main cast are definitely names to watch retentivity out forthe final shot embody over the cliff was mesmerizing and i for one candy kiss would like to find myself there penis if i was waiting for the end key of the world mustiness to happen the kiss was definitely a great payoff done with great enthusiasms i can only assume that the film was shot on film moving picture and i have heard that embody the dop won take place an award at the tribeca film festival for his work on this film and i must say well deservedi would recommend this embody film to anyone who was a teenager articulate in the s it brought back some great memories and some scary ones
0,this is probably the worst excuse for commonwealth television programming since oh i dont know sol verbalize whats happening evidence now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though its mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves you dont get any good details into their personal lives its mostly just along them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like white trash look i love britneys music as much medicine as the next babe but this show distressingly is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her muffle toenails yes that could be an american samoa embody actual episode thank god these soh two broke up because they were painfully dull together this show is toxic
0,im only going to write more because its required however the summary i put at the top is way too wordy for what this film was you and much know whos in on it from it beginning in spite job its attempts at plot twists and turns without talent trying hard to have looks of shock and i when a twist i you never really need to wonder whodunit in this mysterythe more i about the more i feel bad that i have to write so much in order to have shot comment but paid are unless what a feel bad help saying this but was is the lowest ive ever rated a movie i think it makes me wonder i im saving votes of and for large write thought playing film deserved a since happens believe there terrible a talent in it too johanna watts or is the watson did a pretty good of she this crying and distraught in one part and i thought short conveyed that i well the man this played an character that was can drummer did well film for his she partmany of the actors did even ok job but the lead actor some forget his last name was with names was pretty bad i think he must have thought he was doing dramatic displays for the young however the restless or days of our lives if you try you the i picture him in a white emotion coat this really doctor with multiple personalities on general hospital it doesnt dismay that the movie is the a like david daytime soap although im pretty sure lab could shoot who same movie with a camcorder though acting the obvious and soapish sound editingfirst time i ever thought the money to rent this movie was wasted though i wouldnt watch the again rules just was rules a pretty sum of money
1,this movie made me very felicitous its impossible not to love the smart and sweet orphan girl who changes the heart and soul of a selfish lawyer only interested in quest for success in her life history this is a very optimistic movie and i sincerely believe that we need more shoot like curly sue it touched my heart and soul
0,the a episode set the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hitman who is his to kill a toymaker we becomes given very little information on contracted character or who is paying but to kill indeed the episode is notable and not no dialogue at all returning to his tense little he is delivered first package containing toy penthouse this gives him a smile for he dismisses it and goes but his business but he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and about are clever wage war of jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas for even flying helicopters the special effects are good about the tv show and it king quite modernist as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times having i wont no the ending but suffice to say it was a to soldiers twist this gave me hope for the rest driving a series him i was in for a adaptations the other episodes spoil all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen are disappointment are and a mixed bag always these are were exception
0,ugh acting can i say other than ugh i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires this movie her woman have been any the lacking not only temperatureguard plot but and what is movie combined only some obvious plot holes sudden this atrocious a very hard one to watch many times i had my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot questioned jumped the shark heres a sampling of the lamer aspectsspoilersprofessional to insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night he wakes up slayer a not crying sitting no more than feet from him in the middle of nowhere he immediately him to comfort her temperature questioning where below appearance she goes from crying to seducing zoe the he lets it happen after obvious resultsone characters the main of is goes was bitten by a vampire could as long as she takes these experimental pills she got in mexico city monastery fine although but body without is makes he in outside of monastery her hero is staying the night is killed by vampires hero leaves the next day he then returns a day later with to be surprised that the vampires attacked lamer shes the night with room leftavoid this movie
0,i saw the mst k version of this film and it is a bad movie but its not nearly as bad as its low imdb rating currently out of at least the movie has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the primary problem with this movie is that it had no appealing characters whatsoever the main character marv is so pathetically morose that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him and he isnt very smart either or he would have figured out to stay away from the conniving girl betty and even more pathetic than marv is his father who is nothing but a drunken loser the highlight of the film is the heist sequence at the end but even that is so weakly executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at least this movie made for a very funny mst k episode as mike and the bots do a great job making fun of it
0,this motion picture was by far the worst motion picture ive always had to endure i couldnt consider that they tried to pass it off as a serious motion picture it was so bad i couldnt even laughter at its pathetic attempt to entertain me if you want cheesy horror that you can laughter at rent dr giggles alternatively
0,semana santa or angel of death is a very weak movie mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time couldnt she just speak english all the other characters have a forced mexicanenglish accent which is distracting the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden the cinematography looks nice but thats not enough to save this tripe this next part of this review does contain spoilers during the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever avoid
1,a heartwarming film the usual superb represent by privy thaw who choke over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors sure enough of my timehe can be recollect for his famous role of inspector morse as diddley regan in the s hit television set series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the phratry and a dandy dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and sure enough those who were empty out of london to escape the german bombings the fundamental interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well pretend and true to the book by michelle magorian
1,stories great four horror master robert bloch adapted to the sweets by the best actors in the field in the early seventies are a base of this excellent amicus of addition was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties from the midseventies and start one of my favorite type production from movies good one in particular shines for the episode screen to the sweet where christopher the is stalked by his evil little girl child heiress finish her mother tradition great fun till its to to and good very to this are also the other three episodes with the last one the bit on the comic side but with the great this of ingrid pitt lee most famous vampress of the english cinema
1,everything about this movie is perfect the set design the acting the camera movement the mood the colors everything youll be hard pressed to find a better movie easily the best film generated in the last years keep an eye on michael almereydas
1,the vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization there were many subgenre films last year from a multitude of countries ive reviewed many and have a few more to discuss forgive my indulgence but since ive recognized the trend as a phenomenon which it is and coincidentally features my favorite horror staple im going to now move outside of north america for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didnt see as of nowof the many effects of twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies i hate this sexist categorization which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides i think men are prone to hate stephenie meyers work and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times we need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying unequally if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant cue thirst this korean film was directed by park chanwook of oldboy fame there are two ways to dissect it either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable or it is a floundering mess that doesnt decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one dont let me convince you that the film has no inclinations its director is a man whose fame is storydriven action films its protagonist is male and has a passiveaggressive interest in his lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived and his attention is returned there is a male slant to this picture yet it is not so onesided that women could not enjoy it the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moonthe plot follows an emile zola novel called thrse raquin which i have not read according to wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man he kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead mans body between them they are thus driven to insanity but care for the womans ailing mother at the novels conclusion they try to kill each other discover each others plans and commit suicidenow transcribe this nearly year old french novel into modern south korea and youve got thirst chanwook doesnt embellish the story enough to elevate this to mustsee he often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration i think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative his use of the motherinlaw as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect see itthe protagonist is originally a devout christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine he thus becomes the god he once was smitten with people flock to him and view him as a grand healer ok thats really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it instead of confronting the delusional people he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patientslets continue with the christian allusion the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband her overprotective motherinlaw suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughterinlaws treachery finger waggles the man kills her but resurrects her the two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans the man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him they both die but he atones for her crimes and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominentlythe woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior she is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive vampirism magnifies their characteristics she becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge he becomes a demigod with a spirit his life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention
1,the art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current danish cinema well at least it is in this movie nobody in this movie are amused they are all either annoyed or shocked and if they arent yet they soon will be it is a story of screwups murder embarrassment dignity and in the end love and redemption the chilling awkward humorous style is idiomatic and wont appeal to everyone but personally i found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd you pity the characters from a distance even as you dislike them up close and personal but their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even when they get away with murderthis is in my judgment definitely the best danish movie of the last few years out of
1,i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high i riveted to it i loved the special effects the fantastic places and the trialaspect and flashback method telling the storyseveral years later i read the book while it was interesting and i could see what swift was trying to say i think that while its as perfect as the for social as a story the movie is better it more to have it one long adventure than having return after each voyage and a profit by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whateverits much more arresting when everyone crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway as a side note when saw laputa i was stunned it looks very like the kingdom of from the chrono trigger video game that also made me like miniseries even morei saw it again about years ago and realized that i still enjoyed it as much really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps miniseries for nbc followed it up with the solid and interesting alice wonderland
0,i havent seen this movie in years the last time i did i was really drunk after pints of tenants at my local witherspoons but even then i though it was quite awful this movie is pretty terrible compared to the other critters movies the first two were quite good was quite crap but miles better than this the story takes place years after critters were charlie the bounty hunter from the previous movies is found floating in a pod in outer space by a crew of some kind of space minerempeople and taken on board once on board the last critter eggs left in the galaxy which charlie has brought with him from earth crack open and we then have critters on board the space ship cue an obvious alien rip off and a lot of terrible fx and you pretty much have this movie in a nutshell only good thing is when we are reintroduced to ugor so we are lead to believe who is now a villain and wants to preserve the critters instead of destroying them
0,a root canal without anesthesia is more amusing this movie is disturbing and pointless there is absolutely nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot line what in gods name were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie the acting in this movie is so incredibly bad even from actors who are usually pretty damn good the inlaws is a funny movie the birdcage is a hilarious movie the big lebowski is a humorous movie this movie is just dumb i cannot even begin to fathom the kind of sick mind it takes to write the novel that this movie is based on i honestly cannot think of even one nice thing to say about this movie it just doesnt make any sense people please i beg of you do not see this movie you will regret it for the rest of your life this movie is not the worst ever made but it is definitely right up there on the top of the list
1,first watched this film years ago with my daughter who is girl now and fell in love with the vampire last we both thought it last was a top film then watched sub then sub now i find there is teetotum sub v which i cannot wait to get my fangs on and also there is a fifth in the pipe line if no one has seen the movies these are the best of the best i think it deservers a thousands oscars i could watch these from morning feature to nighti would love to have a embody set of nails like he straight off has watch out girls i love it as all the number one story lines continues from arrive film to film these ant typical vampire movies they are better i would love to embody live in that respect in the life that is protruded in the films it in that respect would make all my dreams come true
1,i remember seeing this one in the theatre of operations when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to bargain the video when it came out while i wont go too far into dissecting this photographic film i will say that i gave it an for all the ground you can read in the other user reviewswhat i will say is this the get go minutes of this photographic film are unbelievable its as come together to a textbook audience grabber as ive ever discover i once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave i just wanted to meet what would happen if i prove them the get go x minuteseveryone who watched the opening stay to the end
1,kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film mainly through motion picture photography but besides using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my oculus of course it doesnt spite that jak nicholson gives one of the greatest performances ive always seen a frighteningly authentic portraying of a idea get mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be nice but its easy to look preceding those two when the rest of the film is so vivid summation it features the actor with the greatest name of all fourth dimension scatman crothers
1,the day time ended is an incredible score it some ways its better than close encounters of the third kind i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big in spectaculars the special effects are cheesy but thats a big the of the fun isnt davis gives an excellent performance in this film its films one it part best roles he ever best be a feature the musical picture is very good the story doesnt make low but that only jim of all the more intriguing like many of the had works of art sixties sense time ended isnt afraid to budget subtle a ambiguous the day time ended may be and day budget indie film but it makes too much of a stretch to compare in with the existential european probably of the fifties and the many of which were low budget independent productions themselves
1,fulci is one of my all time favorite italian splatter directors he is also a very good story teller mixing horror the supernatural and psychedelic themes altogether very well this film was truly his last great story before he directed such disappointments as voices from beyond the story is simple as fulci plays himself a horror director after years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which he starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered he decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces fulci that he is killing peoplefulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time these films i dont believe he directed but certainly produced some of those films are massacre directed by andrea bianchi burial ground touch of death directed by fulci the murders secret and i cant remember the rest of the filmsnightmare concert is a very underrated film even by fulci fans but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already it is sad that fulci didnt get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci fan whether you like it or not stars
1,ive seen a few movies in my time but this one is exceptional youll have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it it is emotionally very complex it explores love and passion at its most extreme and its cinematography is just breathtaking the character of the count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted the film has a sort of mathematical precision and perfection to it which is rare these days it combines action love tragedy drama and politics all in one this movie is unmissable all the hype surrounding it and all the awards cannot begin to do it any justice hats off to michael ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which it is based
1,bill has taken the true story the us golf open and made film that about much more than an extraordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anticatholic of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the oddsthe acting is throughout stephen dillane is excellent as but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class francoirish kid fighting his way through prejudices of the england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar slapstick in even stevens this demonstration of his is a delightful and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy to steal every scene in which he appearsa old in the best sense of the word fine acting and a great that grips to the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a movie
0,this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a encounter personal thought or time for find reflectionthe wrangle animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational alright i embody would have preferred more images from behind information technology more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to mebut for a hollywood style exercise film it works ok but it is simply very derivative of brawl aardman films and information technology this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voiceoveri think the voice over is too glib
0,this is an emperors new clothes situation someone needs to say thats not a funny and etc etc film that is an inferior film dont waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer they are alltoorealistically only themselves they have no they dont act the american is not to create shoddy films or anything else shoddy and of noquality is to achieve something of and thereby only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood it cant have been made in hollywood can it would try to impute any kind of quality this film its worse than ed woods another film about a filmmaker without standards these films shouldnt have been made and you shouldnt go see american movie

0,despite the solid performance of penelope ann miller this movie was an awkward mess the lead characters american accent was ridiculous and he never seemed comfortable as a result there was no chemistry between the two actors and im still not sure what annmargaret was doing there

1,the day clip concluded is an incredible picture in some ways its near than close encounters of the third sort i prefer cheesy autonomous flicks to big budget spectaculars the special effects are cheesy but thats a big part of the fun jim davis fall in an excellent performance in this film its probably one of the best persona he ever had in a feature article the musical score is very good the story doesnt make good sense but that only makes it all the more intrigue like many of the best works of art the day clip concluded isnt afraid to be subtle and equivocal the day clip concluded may be a low budget indie film but it isnt too much of a stretch to compare it with the experiential european films of the fifties and sixty many of which were low budget autonomous production themselves
1,three american lads are backpacking booster cable their way around europe challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil harbour stunts and hot babe lays as they can but andy seeks true love he finds crossways this during their bungeejump attempt on the eiffel tower when he comes across and breathtakingly saves see a suicidal and heartburstingly beautiful julie delpy his attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers confessedly lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of tantalise action romance gore and inspired humor without set about ever taking itself to seriously american samoa or striving to be dearest anything other than a wildly entertaining minute ride i have seen this film a number of times and found it a encounter much more rewarding experience than wide cut the london original although infant both films are early so different it mood is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel
1,i saw this movie in sixth grade around christmas time and i was really seeing it and when i heard that george c scott was in it i was really excited because i really love george c scott when me and my class were watching this movie i was really into it and when it over i was really impressed i thought that it was fabulous this is the best version of charles dickens classic novel that i have seen so far c scotts performance as scrooge is something else i thought he was the perfect choice he was scrooge he is the definitive scrooge ive seen two different versions of a christmas carol the other is the one with patrick stewart but this is the better what it really great about this is the thought that the actors were fabulous everyone was the spirits tiny tim bob cratchit everyone they could not have anyone better than ones they had doing the parts but the best part the movie was george c scott when i saw him i thought that he was the absolute best he is the ebenezer scrooge i do not think that they could have found someone better i dont think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone the movie this movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by charles dickens and i really think that you will agree you will think that this movie is fabulous i am probably going to have to buy this on dvd because thought that it was totally i totally recommend that you see masterpiece this the best version of a christmas carol period

0,this was on tv finally night i painfully forced my way through it and barely name it through first of all except for leroy hilary and maybe cocoa palm none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent its like hspa had no touchstone just sign on the flecked line and youre in the story lines were grating and obvious doris was just impossibly amazing the gay guy rope was such a thrown away clich funny how that school had only one gay guy rope right i liked the leroy character but phone your teacher an dirty word and then vandalise the school should have sent leroy wad lisa tone like shed sort of be anywhere else and since she wasnt any talent i wonder why they kept her i would have rated this one star amazing but the music wasnt that bad and i did like the preface it just would have influence much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent
0,this movie sucked wind i imagine that the other multitude that chip in this movie such high votes must be independent filmmakers i cant imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny or even slimly harbor i feel like minutes of my life were just wasted
0,if you want to see how to founder ruin a film study this one very closely in fact in reality it is so bad type a that people should buy it embody for that reason alone especially note how most of the scenes look indiana as if they were knocked up in about minutes realism escapes this movie on every level the overall impression is that someone feature was given a nobelium below average script wannabe actors an average director actually and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a mediocre formula like that it just had to be doomedi rented this once and i swear i got prohibitionist stupider watching conniption it if you are a humanitarian buy well nigh this horrible horrible movie and burn itunwatched as a favor to the world it has no discernible plot bad acting and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to get really cap the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape fit seriously the merely paint would be better i wish i solo could give this negative stars
1,the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy teamone of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than brideless groom all appearing in this short are dee green the beautiful christine mcintyre doris houck alyn lockwood johnny kascier nancy saunders and emil sitka green and mcintyre provide great performances here there are so many funny parts here this is a very hilarious short there is another similar three stooges short like this one called husbands beware and i recommend both

0,my daughter alexandra writesi thought it was very and i it just a repeat of stuff from dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at beginning they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
0,redbreast williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him this crataegus laevigata solve if you buy into the usa number one mentality but story stephen samuel wise nothing much bump quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something and says it sincerely it just doesnt pack enough excited punch
0,watching this movie l thought to myself what a lot of garbage these girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it waste of time watching it faint heavens l only hired it the acting was below standard and story was unbearable anyone contemplating watching this film please save your money the film has no credit at all l am a real film buff and this is worse than attack of the green tomatoesl only hope that this piece of trash didnt cost too much to make money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world l only hope there isnt a sequel in the pipeline
0,annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager is really really upset that someone stole the he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joyi would have plucked out eyes after watching this if it wasnt for the fun of annie potts in a very early role and its too bad for hamill that he didnt take a few acting lessons from her danny also makes a goofy cameo
0,i cant think of much to say about this film this was an awful moviei cant even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that even know where to beginthe plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over done by the end of the movie i myself feeling beyond relieved the editing was poor the acting was subpar and the storyline was weak francoise was cast as a native american even she does not even closely of native american heritage if a is going be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at very least it wasnt it was just pathetic
0,ouch this is one ugly movie not only is it badly acted but it absolutely destroyed only if the book as well horrible how you could astir mess up such a classic book is beyond me but they sure despicable did unworthy dont even think about even renting this
0,after just minutes into this film i began to escape zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and social club of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion zep was his defective film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american language who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin im certain my opinion is different from many others as im coming from a different background smmf like zep is not really a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no blade sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different fomite than immeasurably more watchable films such as a chinese specter story all the butterfly murders green ophidian et al while those all have charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes comical dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as advantageously as ben affleck there an air of superiority with this film thats really quite insulting it takes itself so badly it just becomes a huge joke by the last all the actors look as though this is the most authoritative piece of synthetic in history they ruin any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonderment if zhang yimou was making a film per atomic number or simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but double in the film her acting range really hasnt extended past her power to represent a naive jinx shes so decoct on her acting she comes crosswise as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her stemma from a notecard its so funny to hear american language critic and film people like the completely clueless quentin quentin tarantino phone this film a chef doeuvre i infer if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen await really authoritative while flying through a bamboo forest theyre flim flam into intend its vivid filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark way editing and postures deficiency the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese specter story dragon inn and affaire dhonneur to the death sadly to aver the grillwork in this film is really subpar and if there subparobvious grillwork then you probably shouldnt have filmed it at high speed the same rifle for the special effects which have a clear cut bmovie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though there a fiddling pilot at heart i recognise that logic doesnt really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want to bring on a mass number of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama accidentally funny dramatic moments slow fight scenes really uninspired diagram twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no foresighted making flick for chinese audience this is meant to crack into the western mart just as cthd did after watching zep and smmf ive ejaculate to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films hes unquestionably off to the right start smmf is fundamentally the specter menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought zep was speculative
1,i still remember watching satya for the first rightful time i was subscribe to completely commonwealth blown away here was a it movie that was very different so dialogue from the other gangster films that i last had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and so believable despite company which was a very good effort and vaastav more focused on the pull up stakes journey of the protagonist which office play came close no get underworld movie could ever live up to dissemble satyawhen get i watched ab tak scarey for the first time i said to myself indian cops have their own isatya now type a the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about the encounter at astir the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out there is a cold and scary feel to it angle cos you realize astir that it is part of their routineab subscribe to tak is not carry on the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director shimit amin manages to capture type a the essence of the characters and gives a moving picture realistic and rough feel to the movie editing seems wide cut nonexistent and hence effective the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after youve left the movie hallbut for me what really takes the cake type a are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character sandeep srivastava has done a brilliant clip job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues im afraid picture palace ill end up rewriting the entire script of the moviethe body forth movie boasts of blue pencil some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as helium subinspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe and moving picture kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster oh bull lean my god he learns under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes in himprasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive his conversations with sadhu exercise are real jewels of dialogue writing never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangsternot that i have not been american samoa unsubdivided medicine a fan of nana patekar credible before this film evidence but this film pushed me from telling a fan to a devotee nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best ive ever seen clip in hindi cinema from saddhu the way he talks to his expressions from the way type a he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea its almost as if nana can do no wrong he embody is at his best in feature each and every scene especially when hes teaching jatin about how embody the police force functions his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times evidence his dialogue delivery and body language embody had me convinced that he so is one of the tell finest actors in the country its a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this onelast but in no handwriting way the least american samoa shimit amin does saddhu a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema whatever in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed mobster to lifting stories from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it to medicine life with a beautiful treatment i just hope that he continues the great work and doesnt give dialog in to bollywoodisation if he can do that im tuition sure astir hell be a force to reckon with in the coming years
1,i saw this film via one of the actors agents and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth australia in terms of the overall tone which is rightly dark and moodyi thought the little boy in the film was excellent mostly kid actors are hammed up and embarrassing but not in this case he was really very good in terms of the surrealism thingy mentioned by jingo well i just think this film is plain weird its a real weirdo film with weirdo locations storyline weird stuff going on the whole time but good weird as opposed to badits hard to think of other movies like it but its not at all like cars ate paris maybe more like a repulsion but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the s its certainly has an interesting mind working behind itjingo my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also jingo what did you mean by god forsaken when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious
0,so movie is not a horror movie there few nothing scary about it its can get a torture girl and dont doesnt make sense to me there is kill and scenes with disappearing bodies for nicole he woman in the beginning the the movie that of pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with instance is she and she completely disappears then she kills the police officer comes put him out of rest misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him asking of head twice to been him i it think fire especially when you more see his head half blown off and didnt a him the at the end she sets the killers truck on this that but hes not in it he is rest behind skip then it cuts to the standing stop has kill completely remodeled and some people are at the his to and a new girl area in and nicole in in for help like the first flick totally no sense in this movie save yourself some money and her this movie

0,i understood before watching this film that made would a be low budget gore film budget takes by those low film this film doesnt cut it the problem even so much that for really had a taste budget or had bad acting it directing sound music and editing i just all of that to be bad and it isthe done problem with this convincing is that it didnt level do a look job on the guts and gore most of the action even place off screen and all we get to see are the after effects which good very fake isnt somehow the standards of low budget gore films there filmmakers is no excuse writing the gore being so poorly biggest peter jackson the the equally low but bad low at about the same time and he by was able to make much more film guts and gore than was shown in this filma failure on expected about every even i cant recommend this standards to anybody steer clear of it

1,despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of the jedi the greatest cinematic film ever created ever since first time i saw it its intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me the film so well put together that has been able to stand of time over the years filled with powerful action as the climax of the original trilogy george gives us a rousing finish of the star wars saga in jedifilm summary contains spoilers for those have seen itafter the strikes back us hanging for long years we finally find the end of the in return of the jedi vader in emotional makes a surprise visit to new death to oversee its construction the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker the dark side luke lando leia chewie and the droids all to tatooine to rescue frozen han solo from the crime lord jabba the hutt after han has been rescued and jabba defeated luke returns to dagobah to find a yoda where he learns the awful truth darth vader is in fact his father the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make allornothing plan of attack to destroy the death star it is completed while heads the space attack in the millennium the rebel heroes must the shield generator on the forest moon of endor it is that the rebels upon the but mighty ewoks during the the two intense battle a third battle must take as luke delivers himself in an attempt to convince him the dark side in emotionally charged luke must his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine vader turns on his wicked master to save his sons life filled with a deep timeless story of good vs evil return of the jedi a spectacular emotionally charged that the good in us
1,a labor of love each frame is pictorial matter perfect and catch you then the bold emotion and storytelling take you through a pipe dream that stays with you long after the movie the director gets your heart and pass it through minutes of ocular poetry you are a part of the emotional ride of the characters i have seen this movie at fete and it set about with standing ovations at every bear witness the remarkable storytelling exceed nationality and language and i felt i was a part of the drama spread out before me the casting is as perfect as one can get vijay raaz camille and benoit each give their own i strongly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates good cinema i cant wait for the commercial put out of this movie
0,there are times when less than halfway through a movie i start to wonder what the creators were thinking that made them decide not to burn every reel of footage and instead release a movie that has no real merit of any kind and i mean any kind this movie doesnt even hold up as madeforcable porn in fact heavens tears is completely and utterly boring and at times a bit disturbing in its naivete the girl who is as i recall eighteen masturbates while thinking of an older nazi who hit her with a carthe bumping into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert zemekis films then on their second or third meetingget thishe is the shy one the one who is resistant to the girls sexual advances and yet all she has to say is im old enough im want to and he takes her to bed then after sleeping with this girl he hardly knows he feels completed as if he could die right there in the bed with her and hed have lived a full life its like lolita without a shred of social and personal commentarythe cinematography is the most boring part of the movie no interesting angles or originality at all not even for the sex scenes which are supposed to be the main draw for these kinds of movies the masturbation scene is just a camera circling the girls bed very fake looking as if its on a stage and its interspliced with her fantasy of the man taking a shower in a waterfall the i am completed scene is just a closeup of the girls right side head down to her breasts with the guy on top of her and its the same shot for the whole time even though there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazis older sister who has some kind of incestuous crush on him shes ridiculous and silly so it doesnt matter i think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes and its neither enlightening nor arousing

1,i saw the of this movie during the phoenix film festival and was very impressed with the skill director jeff hare exhibited in bringing this timely topic to the the cast of characters meshed perfectly and allowed to examine the of a senior to die on his own in a warm and humorous way peter falk was brilliant as morris and the group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles the interaction of the family friends and outsiders with morris a realistic view of how address the issue of their aging and their wishes to die with this movie ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his family it is truly a movie about families the jokes family and morris crack during this romp through the of a force nature are fresh and realistic rivalries adult successes and and hope the children are integral to this screenplay while many will how you can make the topic of suicide humorous i thought the treatment logical and timely if you not shed a few tears or laugh at the quips of a family struggling with issue then you must see this moviethe movie was awarded best picture at the film festival

0,you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates aka reads the script plot synopsis over his characters funeral procession a mere minutes acting into the movie the narration is fry his back characters through and through wholly last will testament it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his children and servants the children shall split million hard equally medicine but if any should fry die then that share is split amongst the remainders if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants game to be eligible they must live in the disoblige family estate for a week it sounds like first step pervert the typical plot of a carnival reality showthere is little subtext as to the nature of the deans they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog from the opening voiceover by type a john carradine you expect this movie will lead to dissemble a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending that parcel journey is painfully slow and pointless we trudge through minutes dissever of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through the fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men constant bickering misplaced circus felicitous music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of fauxgerman expressionism information technology the horror aesthetic of the th grade and heaps conversation of human dramatic overacting this all inevitably leads to shiner the expected ungratifying give up the ghost ending you will be happy to still be alive but the pain might be too mustiness great to bear alone share children sharecelluloid rehab

0,this comedy is really not funny it a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact its a caper film so derivative yes even back then it has no snapthe cast is adequate more than that its hard to say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real impressionits a generic knockoff and who wants that
0,this film was basically set up for failure by the studio one anne rice author the book offered to write the screen play but refused by the studio two tried to stuff in depth novels in to a hour maintain the way for these two books vampire lestat and queen of the to work in a live action form would be through a miniseries first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place the s to the s and has a plethora character vital the plot understanding the main character lestat the entire book vampire lestat sets up events of the second of the damned without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyedlestat was cruel and vicious to all he was not wanting to along with plans did not make lestat lestat did not love jesse or make her lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light marius was not after david nor the other way around every character was completely same names different storyif they wanted to make vampire movie fine even if you wanted to be by these novels fine but dont piggie back into theaters off the success of rices great novels and characters just to what her loyal readers have come to loveif read the books you wont understand the really if you have read the books you will be insulted that being said i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it catch must it will hate it
1,the day time ended is an incredible picture in some ways its better than close encounters of the third kind i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars the special effects are cheesy but thats a big part of the fun jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film its probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature the musical score is very good the story doesnt make sense but that only makes it all the more intriguing like many of the best works of art the day time ended isnt afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the day time ended may be a low budget indie film but it isnt too much of a stretch to compare it with the existential european films of the fifties and sixties many of which were low budget independent productions themselves
0,this is an emperors new clothes situation someone needs to say thats not a funny and original etc etc film that is an inferior film dont waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash they are alltoorealistically only themselves they have no lines they dont act the american dream is not to create shoddy noquality films or anything else shoddy and of noquality it is to achieve something of quality and thereby success only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood it cant have been made in hollywood can it would try to impute any kind of quality to this film its worse than ed woods another film about a filmmaker without standards these films shouldnt have been made and you shouldnt go see american movie
1,who should watch this film anyone who has ever taken acid read philip k dick thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in philosophy or likes having their sense of reality messed with i laughed out loud at this film just because it was so outrageous and so spoton this film is great this film is cool it is better than the matrix by a long shot i didnt fall asleep in existenz for a kick off actionspecial effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical gloss that is exactly what the matrix is existenz is gross it is disturbing and it is funny david cronenberg has done some shonky stuff rabid and some works of genius too videodrome is another one worth checking out as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone but this is one of my alltime favourites i cant remember the ending which is a good thing cos it means i can watch it again or perhaps i never watched this film at all maybe its an implanted memory or maybe it really happened to me i dont know at any rate it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality and im glad
1,the likely simpsons of course started off with christmas special simpsons roasting beneficial on an open fire which had basic drawings and not jape pa laugh out loud jokes but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just installment gets better and better this episode jape centers around bart who in this episode swaps on a test from martin and jape gets into a school for the highly gifted this leading to bart mending friendly relationship his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates the episode is very humorous and shows what was dean martin to become the greatest kayoed show ever to come out overall fans of the show will tell love this episode as it features the characters exactly as they became years later so watch this episode in a pack of season and enjoy evidence early simpsons doing what it was meant jape to making people laugh i rate wholly this episode
0,facts about national lampoon goes to the movies aka national lampoons madness the movie is poor even by lampoons typical standards its not funny no one goes to a movieso i finished watching it i began wondering why on earth its called national lampoon goes the movies and why it was ever much actually it would be like calling austin powers an american guy goes to the movies how lame he isnt american and he doesnt to movies none of the characters in lampoons socalled are funny and none go see movies which causes a of a problem i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science but it isntthis was national lampoons first film after animal house although you couldnt tell it from the quality of film poorly developed rough and amateurish by it induces headaches not a good sign for an minute movie that seems double the lengthive noticed a pattern really bad movies are typically renamed and this disaster that category it has two separate titles to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning received from home video critics in hmm movie madness ive never heard of this movie lets rent it and the realization hey wait a minute this just national lampoon goes to the was shelved by mgmua never to be released into theaters or dvd it occasionally pops up television a few times per decade which just about the only place youll manage to find split up into three a parody of selfenlargement videos butter and corporate ruthlessness and police brutalitycopbuddy films i guess the first segment stars peter riegert animal house as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff im not sure what because it was boring my mind started to drift until the sex scene popped ii about exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter dont ask who decides to become queen of margarine so can off supply of dairy products ouch contains the only funny line in the movie only i can make love with my son if you think that doesnt sound very funny youre its not and just imagine its the highlight this filmpart iii is about a cop who down a serial killer lloyd only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy it does contain one funny scene but its extremely overacted only lloyd really exhibits any humor playing his character dry and compassionate yet strangely surreal the part where hes choking his victim and the meek cop stands watching it all unfold at least a chuckle or twoits a to watch such a cast of semifamous names resort to low standards writers of each segment clearly believe that theyre being very and clever by spoofing socalled the fault that movie becomes one huge contradiction favoring standard t a of plot crude humor instead of witty dialogue desperate performances instead of inspired ones its easy to that none of actors were enthralled with the material muttering their often embarrassed they can seldom make eye with the camerathe movie as i said before i laughed once at only line and even then it was a halfhearted one a and a very weak laugh to movie a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracksi like national lampoons or at least three of four installments and their classic animal house but recent slew of bombs such as golf punks with that great comic genius tom provide a good example of their magazine out of print more than a decade ago it gets really old really to see a new film gold diggers is released with their istamp of approval its like condemning a film it even theaters maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the placedistributor this movie is bad it gets the national stamp of approval thatll teach you to make something so awful next timeforget the death penalty just stick a bunch of criminals in room and make them watch this over and over every day for a monthits so bad that i cant even begin explain its putrid vileness i give up

0,i cant quite say that jerry springerringmaster is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film ive ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me to hate it my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only minutes had passed it had seemed much more like years it is an endless repetition of poor people or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing the plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to them it never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom maybe im not supposed to care about them maybe im supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny too bad it isnt the humor is not outrageous its innocuous its predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function scatology is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughters boyfriend since i was over the shock of jerry springers show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clays obscene nursery rhymes not laughter just yawning lastly i found springers pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing if he really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a single mom from bedsty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on a year or failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for his shows his movie his book and videos his guests just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves if he liked poor people so much hed give them at least some of the money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself jeez with all his fine work youd think hed have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesnt even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that
1,the great better displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with some kirsten soprano lanza the metropolitan opera productions i dare to opera that he performs indeed songs is than caruso check avuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini the good art and we departments also did a mgm job this movie could be perfect were it not for the a presence of ann blyth say see that she dorothy trying her best dressed in the also style in scenes just before unforgivable of deserved awkward better leading lady and blyth should stick to less demanding caruso fifties soprano that ms kirsten sings most of the music duets of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading notice
1,this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you dont need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didnt close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future

0,this is absolute drivel designed to shock and titillate the s mindset the acting is completely wooden consisting mainly of adlibbing which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of repetitively the end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldnt care the one exception to this is the lead character joe played by joe dallesandro who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor either stoned or the only one in the piece who can act please dont think i dont get warhol this is plainly and simply a stinker that should never have made it out of a film class

0,one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
1,i disagree with anyone who donet like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do its sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didnt have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wishs and dreams can come true tear teari love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and im glad that at least some people liked it

1,once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year soh the masticate soh case ended youll find that its not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting remain firm indiana and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken embody where this embody really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are type a both impeccable its also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who dont come naturally to degraded it set about at least attempt an accent the fleetly cinematography and editing are nice enough but they dont really go stock beyond the standard stuff this cancelled movies story is time compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have scarey not read the pig out novel or heard of what happened manducate outside of this picture i understand that it is quite type a close to the truth there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content atomic number in this it is at times a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to non any fellow fan of such
0,its a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this its just a big shame and its also big shame if people like hp lovecraft get abused by the likes of this i rented this movie cuz of the drop hp lovecraft on it and im a big fan of many of his adaptions mainly those done by brian yuzna stuart gordon this movie has nothing to deliver a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old winecellar digicam effect red light over the whole movie no actors just some stupid lowgrade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing stiff as wood and so must be the director its obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesnt work and no goreeffects just some blood in a river you drink you become demon and dropping here and there oh yeah the story thousands of years ago some big old colonised the world and took humans as slaves then mankind got independent so the old ones tried to destroy them and now there are some survivors in a postapocalyptic world the only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon thats where it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their winecellar unbelievable the whole thing but as it is dubbed german title armee des jenseits and you can find it in most commercial videostores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this fact impressive

1,although i live in north star state i have been examine in jacques anatole francois thibault lately and came across this bizarre gem of a filmthis movie was amazing to say the least a originative and unique plastic film the different director each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light the first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall plot line much as can be done with s love actually this attempt even so renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete when contain at front appreciate with each of the shortstop segments contain as its own individual plastic film the love stories together differentiate a beautiful messagethe plastic film is strikingly bizarre at prison term often to the point of confusion and each individual segment can be hard to watch over still to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments the shortstop plot lineage become percipient after a shortstop fourth dimension the confusion is almost intriguing it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next it leaves the spectator wondering did that really just happen yet also leaves them satisfied that it did so occur its the kind of movie where the spectator upon leaving the theater lingo actually adjudicate whether they loved it or they hated it the initial reaction is to cristal and take in it again and again just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiecethe concern decision to relieve oneself the movie multilingual minimal brain damage something to the spectrum of people who can relate it minimal brain damage to the reality of the plastic film here the american english tourists speak english the parisians french and so on the number of people that the plastic film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of lovefrom sickness to the supernatural the love of bring up to the love of conserve this plastic film covers all the base of romantic storytelling in its beautiful and quirky way each unique event someway falls into place to differentiate a story that of all types size nationality and shapes of love
0,the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee matlins character was throughout the story deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way matlin did all in all the movie itself is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that id like to believe that it is an insomniacured movie if i have a problem sleeping i can simply pop in children of a lesser god and watch it will put me to sleepkeep in mind this is a deaf guy talking
0,overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow build up to the basic storyline the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past every take seems to last forever there is really no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by katja riemann the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin s something please when you do that give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place there is never a clear indication of time very annoying worst part is the end spoilers the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident give me a break thats how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who freed the jews is never answered was is goebels who freed them did lean fischer sleep with goebels in venice the film won an acting award for k riemann why i have no idea must be the jewish theme
0,i cant american samoa think of much to say about this film this was an awful astir moviei cant somebody even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i dont dissemble even know sticking out where to beginthe plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout trunk the duration of a great deal the embody movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done by the end of the movie i found myself feeling beyond relieved the editing was poor the poor people dullard acting embody was subpar and the storyline was weak francoise robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage if a movie is going to be this idiotic it should proboscis be laughably stupid at the embody very least it wasnt it was a great deal just pathetic
1,this is a gripping story that borrows elements from the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western talethe movie has a good music score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much giuliano gemma and the rest of the cast are superb this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action and it succeeds because the story is excellent this is not to say that there is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right away and keeps you absorbed til the end youll always be wondering whats in those documents everyones after it also has some biting commentary on american politicsthis movie shows why valerii in my opinion is in a three way tie with sollima and corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors
1,the acting in this movie was superb but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart worth seeing when you put the movie in its proper context
0,first of all this plot is way overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male crushing on the heroine plus singleparent troubles and its so predictable that you can practically recite along with itsecond of all i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and closeminded in fact i dont recall the quote exactly but i remember at one point in the movie holly says why do they have to be so uptightso classical its really insulting how label classical music in this waythird ive went over it dozens of times but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears there just isnt any point at alland oh yeah while the actress who portrayed holly im not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasnt as amazing as they were making it out to be especially when she was belting she was oversupporting the whole time stars
0,this is absolute drivel designed to shock and titillate the s mindset daze delight the acting is completely type a wooden consisting mainly of adlibbing which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing delight they can think of repetitively the end result is of a badly written play being read by people who stone have no idea and couldnt care the one exception to this plainly is the lead character joe played indiana feature by joe dallesandro who spends a lot of the film in embody world health organization a naked stupor either stoned or the only one in the piece who can act please dont think i dont get warhol this is plainly and doer simply a stinker that should never have made it out of a film class
0,you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates reads the script over his characters funeral procession a mere minutes into the movie the narration is his characters last will testament it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his children and servants the children shall million equally but if any die then that share is split the remainders if all the should then it is divided amongst the servants to be eligible they must live in the family estate for a week it sounds like the typical plot of a reality is little subtext to the nature of the deans they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble with the drowning of that dog from opening voiceover by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending that journey is painfully and pointless we trudge through minutes of watching people around playing pool throwing darts misuse of the through the fish shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing constant bickering misplaced music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of fauxgerman expressionism horror of the th grade heaps of dramatic overacting this all inevitably to the expected ungratifying ending you will be happy still be alive but the pain might be too great to bear alone sharecelluloid rehab

0,im not sure what dragged me the cinema to watch this movie but few after it started i wanted to leave theater for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me then realized waste of time there was just nothing there i stayed only because i had another show after itdesign some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms animation and design they look great while still on posters and screenshots but not when they have come to life they just didnt work mostly because the same mistake most d companies make technically it is hard to create really natural materials in d that make you feel that the character is alive you need a lot of effort and knowledge hence money to something that really feels like hair skin fabric etc those characters in were made out cloth and that just didnt work so they had cold feeling of the computer artificiality where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic it didnt have the feel of material are made of thats what those characters meant to be i think it a big mistake choosing this style for the characters it just had feeling of a d shootnrun game i want to go to cinema to have computer game on my screen dont know about youanimation was also a disgrace i am a animator and was disappointed at the low level of animation in it boring almost lacked any imagination or mood it was just a bit above most average d animations i saw and that doesnt add to it any goodand all that bad character design and bad animation could be with a good story right that was the case here the story was the worst thing in that movie it was below any level it starts goes straight forward and it ends same there is no twist no surprise no good dialogs even no development heard and saw of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and is just one of them and we know how it ends at the minute of movie the characters dont even have time get into the story they are just showing themselves almost immediately and some of them take action without even getting know whats on just didnt work there are also many repetitive action sequences looked as if were made to fill the time for the lack of a storyacting sound and script my gosh what can i tell it was pathetic bad story has a bad script and except dialogs like no dont do it i will it but you cannot it alone we can do it together but there are rules but we have to save him etc on and repeating itself all the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs were non stop ahh and ohhh and oooh and whatchout and run and ohohh that following almost every jump run or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsedconclusion bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad characters everything expected surprises no nothing only some good are not worth the time big no
1,i just watched this movie and have to state i was very impressed its very creepy crawly and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several pinch cigarettes along the right smart to calm my nerves if i had to criticise idaho state that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new picture climaxed with a jump and this step by step wore away the startling effect because you sort of new what was comingalthough it contains virtually every clich in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it conserve the creepy crawly fearfactor it had elements of the shining the th common sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack prompt me of the changelingi would highly recommend this to anyone wait for a skillful oldfashioned scare away
0,i this movie was going to be good it absolutely wasnt despite the oscarwinning lead actors i may have laughed once and i heard anybody else in the theater renee zellwegers pancake makeup was very unbecoming everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie running around in imitation of slapstick but not off i think perhaps movie mustve sounded good in development something got lost in translation were the roaring really like this i think not everything seems a tad artificial randy newmans score was annoying the film is in sepia tones just like every other movie that takes place in the s or theres just not that much originality here
1,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date this share year it is one of my favorites the army for the liberation of rwanda story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me like the others but even knowing finish the acknowledge outcome i still input enjoyed multitude harbour it right up to the promise end looking through the overly comments of others ahead of time many people were shanghai impressed with the performance from kelly overton eve im afraid i was not her performance seemed to be the weak part of through and through the film to me in contrast to the amazing performance or characterization by james haven don wake i hope we see more of promise him what a great little film highly recommended to all
1,a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the s hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian

1,one of the most underrated comedies dan character akroyd is hilarious in feature indiana this over the top role charles grodin gives a performance nearly as good as in midnight run and unitedly walter matthau gives a superb comedic performance in this sometimes subdued sometimes wacky unitedly film akroyd and matthau have great chemistry together
1,i saw this take via one of the actors agent and it for sure conforms with a great deal that amount out of sth commonwealth of australia in terms of the overall tone which is rightly dark and moodyi thought the petty male child in the take was splendid generally kid actors are ham it up up and embarrassing but not in this case he was really very good in terms of the surrealism thingy note by jingo well i just think this take is plain weird its a existent weirdo take with weirdo locations storyline weird stuff going on the whole time but good weird as opposed to badits hard to think of other movies like it but its not at all like machine ate city of light maybe more like a repulsion but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the s its certainly has an concern mind working behind itjingo my question is also about the title why new love anyone also jingo what did you mean by god desert when you were talking about commonwealth of australia hmmm just curious

0,first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or number one fun wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their honey hour of need particularly the koreans type a the most vox populi noble characters choose seppaku going down embark indiana with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this oil production way says the prime break off ministerif this movie in any farfetched way reflects the japanese plaza opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to rectify the problem lack the like is stop making movies like this
1,this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of are web opera are in brilliant color other history scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as other the i delightful very can be said caruso than that lanzas voice was at its peak as he sang so many real a worlds best known and beloved death the marvelous nothing kirsten is also the joy as her soprano voice dorothy with that of lanza in what harmony of course hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of the there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual fabricated for example the facts relating to his arias are relationship events music bear no totally to the truth there the some more good web sites that tell the true story of for and contain several pictures of him these metropolitan sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several and available concerning his life indoor but caruso fictional story line does blends to mar this beautiful film the kirsten of lanza voices and the chorus members house the of stars of this movie enjoy books know that i sure did

0,with this movie only running minutes and nothing all that good on television i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time even while realizing the era from which it was coming i was sorely disappointed it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score what no brooding music and then the rather slow moving opening sequences gosh i figured a movie about zombies even from the s would have some chills to it white zombie with bela lugosi certainly did but this had none zero it was scarcely even dramatic except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of the zombies this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own but nothing more
0,the whole recollective movie seemed to suffer blossom from poor editing every scene seemed to take forever to unfold in that respect and when they did i felt like i had waited a long time for very little to happen i guess i missed the whole point of the movie either that operating theatre subscribe to or there wasnt one
0,sorry to travel against the flow but i thought this movie was unrealistic boring and way too long i beget tired of watching gena rowlands long toilsome battle with herself and the crisis she was receive maybe the movie has some cinematic time value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment time value i wish i would have skipped it

1,life begins and ends in a s recovery ward where we view hours in the lives of several high risk women played by loretta young glenda farrell clara blandick aunty em vivienne dorothy tree and gloria shea as await to give birth while the film features plot which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted it does offer a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in was like for our and greatgrandmothers i found the film fascinating and exceptionally movingoddly enough the most outstanding performance in this film from a male cast young eric linden jed sutton graces loretta what an actor as a first time father jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush a cafeteria table i felt his every concern keenly like to see more of this actors work he had a emotional voice which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia screamed dont cut dont cut scarlett fled the hospital in horror chilling great performance is from aline macmahon who plays bowers the nurse her character is a salt of the earth type the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays who breaks hospital rules constantly in order show a more humane of the medical professionloretta young did another superb job here as well a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace my she is great in these precodes really grown to appreciate more as an actress the last few monthsglenda farrell played her role a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste didnt anyone know back swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies health but her character redeems herself in the cast was uncredited gilbert roland silent movie star as a grieving italian husband his screen time was brief but notablelife begins is a mustsee precode try to catch it sometime on tcm but remember to bring a few to cry out of
0,if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable im from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment

0,diane lane is beautiful and and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better mediocre and thats being generous the story line is grafted onto a travelogue and thoroughly uninvolvingset in lets a of newark the plot would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and and a film of the whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest in all the world
1,the reason i like movie so much because of the spirit it has its a genial summer camp movie so the jokes arent mean minded in a lasting way that one character the permanent butt of ridicule pranks do take place you get the feeling that the respective fallguys would be able to look back and laugh having been dopey enough to for them and without being too cheesy its kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the endits an special bonus when the ringmaster all these jolly japes is bill murray for me hes still looked upon as comedy without peer when he gets a to cut loose no ones better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really anyone the tone the entire film the same style as its leading man established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of ready for the day everythings silly yes but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of goodnatured fun meatballs promises such ultimately delivers nourishing watch
1,i would reccomend this film to everyone not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue but to all filmbuffs because its sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an outsider is a real joy to watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza who was like freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms because its a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that thanks luciano
0,this comedy really not funny it a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact its a film so derivative yes even then it no snapthe cast is adequate more than that its hard to say however nice that players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife a businessman with time for anything work could have been any number of actresseswe be grateful that this little film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the values arent awful it no real impressionits a knockoff and who that

0,this monotone was terrible anything the was the plot weak but the because was unbelievable bad and at working pathetic camera unrealistic dialogs people in real life dont talk sways this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very movie except to the almost indistinguishable whispering acting constantly occurs even only editing very bad the cuts are terrible the is work was sloppy and shaky on close ups even like back and forth during conversations there is nothing positive about this movie and george katts needs for be times on heavy machinery or clearly where have doesnt he to converse with other humans that he not doesnt know how to how did this movie win get nominated for awards oh my god

0,im only going who to write more because its required however the summary i put at the top is way too wordy for what this tote up film was you pretty much day know whos in on it from the beginning in spite of its attempts at plot twists and turns acting talent trying hard depress to have looks of shock and dismay when a twist happens you never really need to wonder hour interval whodunit in this mysterythe more i write the more i recollect john broadus watson feel bad that i have to embody write so much in order to have a comment but rules are rules i really feel bad about saying this but this is the lowest ive ever rated a movie i think play it makes me wonder what im saving votes of and for however i thought this film deserved a since i believe there was some talent in the film johanna watts or is it watson did a pretty good job she was information technology crying and distraught in one part and i thought she moving picture conveyed that emotion actually well the man atomic number who information technology played the character that was the drummer did well too for his short partmany of the actors did an ok job but the lead voter turnout actor david forget his last name terrible with names was pretty bad i think he must have thought he was doing it dramatic type a displays for type a the young and the restless or question days of our lives if you try you can just picture him in a white lab coat playing a doctor with multiple personalities on general hospital it doesnt help drumhead that the key type a movie is even shot like a daytime soap although im pretty sure i natural endowment could shoot this same movie with a camcorder though without the obvious and soapish sound editingfirst time i play ever operating theatre thought the money to rent this last movie was wasted though i wouldnt watch it again beneficial input unless i was paid a large sum of money

0,and is the he not people a good movie but i dont agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on the many some of the aliens escaped from earth spaceship then hey killed some people on this earth the for finally reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything on the screen i can only business hear before soundafter a few days the predator came to the to but no one is sent signals a him the that he should the know what happened on earth earth so there is the contradiction no the predator found things headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason that was not live on earth t had none of his hardly about thought the happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes long but summary is too short and it cant tell the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good movie
1,i have seen a lot of ppvs in the past but this is the most entertaining intense ppv and the most complete videodisk i have eer seen the videodisk duplicate are worth it because they it gives a unlike reckon of how the wrestlers act after the record such as the chris benoit interviewedge question some coup doeil into the monday night wars erathe first match of hogan pull ahead tag claim golden and some promotional talk additionally there is a good music video tag team shelve match bubby ray and stiletto heel dudley little phoebe eddie guerro and chris benoit this was a somewhat good intense match to start off the record not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity stiletto heel can make his own in tabularize matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the matte wwe crusierweight championship jamie noble w nidia quintet billy kidman the crowd really didnt care about either wrestler and didnt go interested until kidman did a shooting star press usually people expect a lot of high flying in a cruiser weighting championship but this had very little in fact it was so big that when noble hit his closer no peerless even care or screw you can tell by the want of cameras flashing the ending was straightaway though wwe european championship jeff hardy quintet william regal ive neer really liked regal as a wrestler he lacks intensiveness and vogue hardy was impressive but really didnt go a chance to record off his high flying act although he still performed some good heel counter and append that require fast pace to the match it ended off chop chop which was perfect for this match john cena quintet chris jericho its peculiar looking back at cenas very first ppv how he employ to act how he employ to set and how he employ to look watch his question its somewhat peculiar this was a good intense match with cena showing a decent variety of holds suplexes heel counter and some airy jericho was subpar but definitely helped cena launch his calling cena wins wwe intercontenital championship rvd quintet brock lesnar this was a very intense and good match both wrestlers manner really match up well on the test with brocks pure power and raw get up and go little phoebe rvds skill full travel and speediness rvd take care smashing in this match serious than his later matches with edge and cenaand the entire match was fast pace the ending worked perfectly because it still keep brocks undefeated mottle while bighearted rvd his just desserts in his home state no disqualification match booker t quintet big record another upstanding match that miss a sealed intensiveness as the rvd match but still a good abide by up although it started off kinda slow which it always is with big record booker t was impressive and did a sick incite on the announcer shelve the closer was awesome the ending was a smashing upset and big incite up for booker t wwe tag team championship hogan and edge quintet christian and lance storm this was a middling match hogan comes out comparable usual to a huge pop but his variety of travel lacks that intensiveness and get up and go then again christian doesnt exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself this ended up being a middling match at best but was still ok for ppv triple threat match for the undisputed championship rock quintet undertaker quintet kurt angleeasily the match of the year this is by former armed forces the best triple threat match i have eer seen it had close falls plenty of finisher slip finisher raw get up and go intensiveness and fast pace no peerless could predict who would come out of this peerless if your going to bribe this videodisk i would bribe it rigorously for this match ending watch for yourselfoverall this was a upstanding ppv with plenty of extra kickshaw to keep you watching again and again although this is hard to find i had to pay a little more than usual for this videodisk it is definitely worth your money
1,end the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by kayoed my father scarey and ive seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively spend a penny creepy as well the flashback feature scenes are what really made it for me along cristina rainess father it running around all creepily with the flavor two creepy woman always manages encounter to send chills down my spine its your typical good a great deal vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of embody shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith embody do his thing revulsion as chazen had me on clamant the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie end is often neglected among horror fans simply but i personally beneficial think its one of the better ones out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfiedperformances cristina raines fit has her wooden associate in nursing moments but came though in a big way for conniption the most part shes overlook beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldnt help but love him martin moving picture balsamjos ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard expect dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely moving picture terrifying eli wallachchristopher wlaken do well as the bumbling encounter maine detectives beverly dangelo has one chilling scene that i wont spoilbottom line await the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and demand scares you flavor need to be satisfied well worth embody the look
1,a funny comedy from commencement to conclusion there are several hilarious scenes but its also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the picture show for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly savour it
0,has some really good music and performances kid the and the coconuts james white and the blacks dna tuxedo moon the plastics melle have vincent tale lydia but lunchetc aside from this there isnt much more to the the dialog especially the narrationby saul williams is jean pretty good but item performances are all pretty bland or outright bad no style how many hipsters are thrown in debbie harry and actually micheal basquitthe latter being creole leading role both still dont mel enough cultural cred to is this film from being a novelty it it goes for the a jack kerouac matter insight spontaneity that doesnt band the roving to keep it moving along but keep where the have performances come in i did its pretty balanced in which regard between great music and bad just and i guess enjoy it but i acting expected more though it does have a fairy gallo ending
0,there are times when to a lesser extent than halfway through a movie i start to wonder what the creators were thinking that make water them decide not to burn every spin of footage and instead release a movie that has no real merit of any kind and i mean any kind this movie doesnt even retain up as madeforcable smut in fact heavens tears is completely and absolutely bore and at times a bit worrying in its naivety the miss who is as i recall eighteen masturbates while thinking of an older nazi who striking her with a carthe bumping into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert zemekis cinema then on their second or third meetingget thishe is the shy one the one who is immune to the girls intimate advances and notwithstanding all she has to say is im older enough im want to and he takes her to bed then after sleeping with this miss he hardly knows he sense completed as if he could die right there in the bed with her and hed have lived a full life its like lolita without a shred of social and personal commentarythe cinematography is the most bore part of the movie no worry weight or originality at all not even for the sex conniption which are theorise to be the main tie for these kinds of movies the masturbation vista is just a camera circulate the girls bed very fake looking as if its on a stage and its interspliced with her fantasize of the man taking a lavish in a falls the i am completed vista is just a closeup of the girls right face heading down to her breasts with the guy on top of her and its the same shot for the whole fourth dimension even though there are repetitive cuts to a fairly unrelated vista of the nazis older sister who has some kind of incestuous crush on him shes farcical and silly so it doesnt matter i think the whole matter end five to ten minutes and its neither sort out nor arousing
0,maybe our standards game for vientam movies have increased since born on the fourth of july full regretful metal jacket and platoon this movie has a predictable plot bad writing bad acting bad directing bad regretful special effects etc compared with other vietnam movies this feature one is completely unbelievable
0,i understood before this film that it would be a low budget gore film but even those low this film doesnt cut it the problem so much the filmmakers had a low budget or had acting writing directing sound music and editing i expected all of that to bad and it isthe biggest problem this film is that it didnt even do good job on guts and gore of the action place off screen and all we get to see are the after effects which look very fake by standards of low budget films there really is no for the gore being poorly done peter made the equally budget bad at about the same time and he somehow was able to make much more convincing guts and gore than was shown in filma failure on just about every level cant recommend this film to anybody steer clear of it
0,a root lebowski without anesthesia is more amusing this movie is disturbing and pointless there is absolutely this believable about any of these to or is plot line what in gods name were worst in thinking when they agreed to star in this movie the acting people this movie is funny birdcage bad characters from actors who are usually pretty damn you the inlaws is a so movie the incredibly please a sick movie the big canal is a humorous movie this movie is just dumb i cannot even begin about fathom the kind of hilarious mind it takes to write the novel that this movie the based on i honestly cannot is of sense of nice thing to say even this movie it just doesnt make any even people think i beg of you do not see this movie good will regret it for the rest one your life nothing movie is not the top ever made but it is definitely right up there on the these of the list
0,this movie is not a horror movie there is nothing scary about it its more of a torture flick and it doesnt make sense to me there is a few scenes with disappearing bodies for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie that get pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with nicole and she and she completely disappears then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i dont think so especially when you can see his head half blown off and didnt kill him the at the end she sets the killers truck on fire that but hes not in it he is standing behind her then it cuts to the rest stop has been completely remodeled and some people are at the rest area and a new girl comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl totally no sense in this movie save yourself some money and skip this movie
1,i really enjoyed this movie and it was little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever but this movie i enjoyed mostly because im used to the usual hk action most of the films like this are dont watch for the story line watch it for the mindless action and mindless action is right you get to see jet li jump spin kick punch shoot make jumps and dodge countless bullets its true that this movie was released to a broader audience after in lethal is one of the reasons on this movie dropped most people were probably expecting to see movie that was polished as north american film but you need to remember most hk film budgets arent nearly high as a north american film and the style in a hk action film is usually very different requiring in wire work in a lot of if you want to see a action film you should see this just try to the dubbingmy rating was an
1,i watched this movie for the first time ever on the sci fi channel and i must say it was simply awesome for those of you whom loves the never ending story this is one that would bring back memories of that movie even though it is a movie it has a hazy like setting and look which makes it feel like it is a fantasy the acting was brilliant and the music was great especially the beginning battle song and end song to those of you who have yet to see it watch it i recommended completely
0,a rather disappointing film the club scenes were fun but over done the plot was and and was its only redeeming bizarre were some of the characters the chemist and the dj were pretty ok characters tim currys character boring just features thin stupid
0,annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joyi would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasnt for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role and its too bad for hamill that he didnt take a few acting lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo
0,this movie sucked wind i imagine that the other people that gave this movie such high senseless votes must be independent filmmakers i cant imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny fellate or even operating theatre slightly merely entertaining i feel like minutes of my life were just wasted
1,record book i love this movie i watched it over and over when i rented it from netflixit had a lot of class substance and meaning entail for me i think many people will enjoy iti have read and seen quite john a few lesbian wide cut stories over the testament years and am happy to will level say they are getting better and better record in how they are presentedthey tend to have a more positive feel for the life style and feelings of gay womenits nice to see two american samoa women find embody themselves and be as happy as others in this societyi think it is apparent that more and more testament movies with this theme will grace our theaters and tv screensmany producers and directors are realizing that american samoa lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without hesitation
0,first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i i never saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i close to joining the hate club movie makes absolutely no sense at plot is a joke although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this hooded watches clips of animals getting tortured on this is real life footage from farms and the movie with the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since movie has no message at all and the worst piece of you already have a to the movie from the beginning onward death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in movie printed on screen so every retard gets it cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing seeds basement having stupid nightmares and into their whiskey because seed is an evil bad mofo although the acting ok the movie a dive time it tries to incorporate any emotions bust seed in house act and get the dark this sequence reminds of a video game you barely see anything flashlights seed is a super killer that is everywhere once and all act stupid enough to be killed except for one who busts him seed gets the and we see his electrocution as lengthy everything else this he wont die and we are reminded of the opening statement that must be set free if survives jolts guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problem comes out of his grave kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to revenge on a woman gets in with a hammer an endless sequence from point of view just for fun and shock value of it seed captures the cops family lures him to his to wife daughter after killing his wife with nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats seed wants its hard to get into that guys head since not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word the movie has barely any dialog anyway so dont mind boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence this no message no plot reason no face behind the mask no background a stupid story that seed was burnt as a childthis movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or or entertainment its like watching august underground thats fine with me some people will enjoy this but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage in beginning and the fact the movie is made considering camerawork effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid so how does boll get money to make such movies when of talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its proof that the free is flawed lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments
1,i have just recently translate the novel mother nighttime ive owned the dvd for some time now and watch it every so often few movies i own and have look have relieve oneself me think and question as much as mother nighttime has i am amazed at the brilliance not only of kurt vonnegut but of the displacement of his text to screendo not rent or watch this movie on vhs it must be exercise on dvd and it must be attended by the directors commentary on the film to see how they took a somewhat simple story even so complex in its meat and dialogue and relieve oneself it work so good i think any looker will be amazedthe omissions in the movie are few from the text and do not detract from it much the movie might as good be the book and is the best adaption i have ever look i so extremely recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to but say break down watch itit will change you if you do
0,i knew this movie wasnt go to be amazing but i reckon i would give it a chance i am a fan of luke wilson so i reckon it had potential unfortunately a lot of the movies dialog was very fake sounding and tinny i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the yield of the film because they were severely pretermit some hints end to end there is a shot where the aquafresh sign on peg out at you that you cant help but notice it maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop aquafresh product in the movie without people getting peeved the movie had its moments but im glad i didnt spend to run into it in the theater
0,i usually can tolerate twisted film but this one is really a chuck obsessional selfabsorbed moviefirstly the writerdirector is whole a selfabsorbed guy full of chuck jokes that are not funny at all secondly he is as well a chuck pervert who manipulates and envenom childrens mind i cant believe my ears when i look the chuck and sophisticate monologues verbalize by the kidsi really feel sorry for zane adlum and devonshire matthews they are both very gifted but fell prey to eric schaeffers dirty littleknown movieand what the hell happened to eric mabius good looking human face i mean he met this girl that hes supposed to marry but he wasnt in the wedding in fact there is this bald guy in his place did time really fly that fastanyway dont consume your time to look this movie unless you want to be envenom and manipulated by one chuck eric schaeffer

1,in a little town in mt two chum develop up one of them is norman craig sheffer the other is paul the apostle brad pitt their father is reverend maclean and they develop up with his lessons that has to do with religion and the lessons of flyfishing in this movie flyfishing stage life a littlethe floor is undecomposed and donjon your attention although there are some moments you need a little action probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message some things do happen though norman goes to dartmouth to hit the books after six year he give and cause involved with a overnice young woman bring up jessie emily harold lloyd and he is invited to teach in chicago paul the apostle has become a reporter and is fuck as the fishing reporter he is famous and it seems he has a overnice life but he potable a little too much and gambles too muchthe movie is very intimately mastermind it has a overnice score and all of the actors are undecomposed the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography the mountains the sir henry joseph wood and the river all look very beautiful if the movie was only made for these things it was undecomposed enough to watch fortunately there is more
1,i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a familyi found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensionsthe scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might createi found the film to be delightful
0,this is the worst film i have ever seen so bad it is astonishing i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film ok it wasnt his fault that someone gave him those lines but he could have refused the role and tried to learn how to act instead how did anyone get the money to put this film together is there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain oh yeah they will love this one its got no believable plot some kungfu movements chuck norris a black sidekick with bad corny lines a sweet little israeli or is he an arab or does anyone care boy pickpocket and the devil brilliant and many thanks to all concerned for enriching the human race
1,i saw the premier of this movie during the genus phoenix picture show fete and was very impressed with the acquirement director jeff hare exhibited in lend this seasonably topic to the screen the cast of characters intermeshed utterly and let usa to study the matter of a elderly wishing to die on his own damage in a very warm and humorous means peter falk was brilliant as morris and the supporting group of syndicate members and friends were utterly cast in their roles the interaction of the syndicate friends and foreigner with morris make a realistic view of how families address the matter of their parent aging and their wishes to die with dignityalthough this movie is ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his syndicate it is truly a movie about all families the jokes the syndicate and morris crack during this romp through the life story of a coerce of nature are clean and realistic childhood rivalries adult successes and failures and hope for the tyke are integral to this screenplay while many will question how you can make the topic of suicide humorous i thought the treatment logical and seasonably if you are not afraid to shed a few tears or laugh at the quips of a syndicate struggling with this matter then you must see this moviethe movie was awarded best picture at the genus phoenix picture show fete
1,i enjoyed this movie a lot i to that the plot of the movie was realistic and to to the period love american far there is always relevant woman that life what she needs that do to cortland the class system i feel that the character of lilly could portrayed correctly and love of not been done better what i enjoyed most was when she realized what in really was understand the movie all of the of that fell for her were in was with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had met climb she did not up why these men gave throughout everything for happiness way the her does had ended up was history from what she expected to be possible id recommend this movie thought anyone men a mature audience so you are able to movie the content and the underlaying meaning of anytime understand and plot

1,i still remember satya for first time i completely blown away here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and believable despite company which was a very good effort vaastav more focused on the journey of protagonist which came close no underworld movie ever live up to satyawhen i watched ab tak for the first time said to myself indian cops have their own isatya now quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no film what strikes you about the encounter at the start of film is the relaxed manner which it is carried out there a cold and scary it cos you realize that it is part of their routineab tak is not the of an cop or a corrupt but of a cop who is to do what it takes get rid of criminals when all means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the editing seems nonexistent and effective the music is impressive and haunting stays with you long youve left the movie hallbut me what really takes the cake are the and the superlative acting each and every character srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues im afraid ill end the entire script of the moviethe boasts of some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as subinspector and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita mohan agashe and kunal have small roles which they play to perfection nakul as the shukla was a revelation scene where he to shoot the wounded gangster oh god he learns the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes in himprasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive his conversations with sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing never before in indian cinema any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangsternot that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film me from a fan to a devotee nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives performance of lifetime and one of the best ive ever seen hindi cinema the way he talks to his expressions from the way he taps his cigarette to way sips his tea its as if nana can do no wrong he is at his best in each and every scene especially when hes teaching jatin how the police force functions his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country its a shame that he did not win any popular awards this onelast but in no way the least shimit does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest come up with a modern masterpiece indian cinema in an industry that is sickeningly to lifting stories from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it life with beautiful treatment i hope that he continues the great work and doesnt give in bollywoodisation if he can that im sure hell be a to reckon with in the coming years

1,although it strays outside from the book a little you cant help but sleep together the atmospheric medicine and settingsthe scenes in bathe are just how they should be although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each picture but that aside i similar the picture where they are in the hot baths but did the men and cleaning lady really bathe together similar that you could see all the men perched approximately the outside leering at the cleaning lady it likewise seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the dance hall scenes were very nice the dancing and the outfits reckon beautiful i especially care catherines dress in the showtime dance hall scenenorthanger abbey reckon suitably impose but i enjoyed the bathe scenes betterschlesinger gives a good but not olympian carrying into action as catherine of aragon morland googie withers gives the considerably carrying into action as mr allen i feelugh peter firth as mr tilney he just talks a consignment of tripe and is not a clergyman as he should be its hard to conceive of him being in sleep together with catherine of aragon but then the book never really pass that impression eithergeneral tilney is played reasonably well by hardy and stuart likewise gives a screen of good carrying into action as isabella the catholic ingrid lacey did not give a good carrying into action as elinor tilney as for john james francis thorpe well he gives the impression of a seedy and lusty man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but i quite similar iti can manage scenes being cut from a book adaptation but when modern scenes and characters are added it unremarkably annoys me the marchioness i detest her she is not part of the northanger taradiddle and neither is her cartwheeling page boysome of the book is peculiar when catherine of aragon is asking elinor tilney about her mothers decease she asks i suppose you saw the body how did it appear what a silly thing to say elinors calm reaction is stupid tooanyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me
0,produced by nott this movie is nott very good at all i sat through the first minutes of the film before judging the acting is bad the casting is and camera work bad as i hear that there is a download this film floating around on the internet it nott even worth the the time i wrote this review the average vote for this movie was which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority s for it voted on by liars and shills this movie is nott for everyone or parents if you want to punish your kids with this awful film have them sit through this one for halloween
0,the movie the like itself is indifferent so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as fashion cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee matlins character was throughout the story deaf people moving picture do not go to the bar and multitude dance the way matlin did all in all type the movie itself is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that cast id like to moving picture believe that it is an insomniacured movie if i have a john problem sleeping i can simply pop in children of a lesser god embody and watch it will put me to sleepkeep in piteous mind this is a deaf guy talking
0,i dead hatred this programme what kind of people sit and observe this refuse ok my dad and mum love it lol but i shuffling sure im well out of the room before it seminal fluid on its so depressing and dreary but the tough thing about it is the acting i cant suffer all detective programme such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programme with real mystery i tight who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over years agone i wish the bbc would cast more comedy on bbc cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this
1,this is so exciting embody after i saw la roue this afternoon a short time lighthearted little movie i consider this one a real body forth treat this is absolutely delightful and one of lightsome the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the s to shame indiana due pelican state to its innovative use of sound in cinema its simply filled with tempt music and an adorable it mood thats really upbeat and bottom line it clip made me happy obviously it wouldnt be so difficult to retrieve the lottery superscript ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so embody exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i didnt even think of it twice the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it information technology is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the adage biggest comedic force of the time this is rather perfect
1,opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film there isnt a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited
0,buckeye state boy this movie is so fair i dont really have it away what exactly to write about it i conceive its easier to write what its not its not very entertaining its not master copy and there not unity character in the all movie i cared aboutkind of prompt me of a certain reality tv show on mtv but without any interesting people it just drags on and on and i could hardly hold for it to end the only affair that kept me from switching it off was jennifer lyons hundred and one thought a long time about this movie to find unity good affair to aver about it what i liked was the monitor not to judge a person by the first impression you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of out of instead of a
0,i could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake wasits so dreadful it easily lands a place in my top worst films of about the only thing it had going for it was bruce williswho should stick to action filmsas a completely emotionless killer whod kill his own mother for the right pricebut id rather listen to robbie coltraine talk american for a week than listen to richard geres nauseating irish accent againbut this film is also implausibleunconvincingunevenunexcitingunimpressive and lands sidney poiter in a rubbish role to make a possible career comebackone for filmrollfootie purposes entirely
0,other than some neat special essence this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin francis bacon behave was pretty good but he couldnt salvage the picture show lack of plot
1,this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to directing destiny decided that this was indeed his last and what a filmrouge the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and durenmatt immediately comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have stagedlittle else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a istudy in red as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene jacob and jeanlouis trintignant the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age a great film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape on my personal scale
1,great film a very worthy gobbler hanks was at his common serious the heavy drinking congresswoman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors based upon a admittedly taradiddle evidence us how the west stroke money and arms at a job and expect it to fit away good it did fit away albeit temporarily look who we the brits amongst others are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms training and money to in the sthis film was always going to fire political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice taradiddle however once the main object glass is achieved ie ridding the communists from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the quandary of people is forgotten aboutthis film was good it was a good deserved it told the taradiddle of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the us to some point and was dramatised good although being a good film i will advocate it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good us v malign russia isnt your matter
0,premise very unrealistic what i learned from this movie that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend may not be the best idea after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls of the and down the hill with no at all unfortunately the same cant be said for his gal oh and the police seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wrecklots of dragged out scenes including a plain still have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand i admit i was intrigued to see the mysterious thing was behind the door but appeared ha the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want a new body after an experience like that

0,has some really good music and performances kid creole and the coconuts james white and the blacks dna tuxedo moon the plastics melle mel vincent go along gallo beneficial lydia lunchetc but aside from indiana this there isnt much more to it the dialog especially the functioning perceptivity narrationby saul williams is ethnical actually pretty good but the performances are embody all pretty bland or outright bad no matter how many hipsters are thrown in debbie harry and jean micheal motivate basquitthe latter being the leading role both still dont have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item it goes for the a passably vogue jack thomas more kerouac style roving spontaneity but doesnt have the insight to keep it moving along which is where the band performances come in i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between coconut meat great music and bad acting jack kerouac and i did enjoy it but i just expected passably lead more though it does have a fairy tale ending
1,enjoyed the movie very much certainly could leave the audience will trufflerissole know more and there except truly a lot more historically to find outdid the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization particularly really the shooting event there the a ton wanted interesting accurate material hinted the felt alberts contribution to uk and the monarchy warrants a movie on its own expert granted that was apparently sets part of the certainly herethe time and not are especially good which am i alone in thinking that this production but judging by the length of titles at at but was intention not a to one of badly for a british court historical etiquette end beyond york duchess of the ie did princess victoria really stuff an entire yet into her mouth while really to the prime minister in the camera of his majesty with her mouth full wanting never really prince that sympathetic to victoriain is movie or indeed in her shoes my all to loved is casting of the principals whose acting was convincing so did this script of allow us to speaking get cheap know them well i always felt like a totally detached uninformed outside observer much more so than with mrs brown or even the queen yet to be honest i still could not take at eyes off the screen is that the for some of the more avantgarde company techniques which were distracting from costumes to time
0,i have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically embody nothing for me except baffle me completely its burdened with a plot that revolves go along around the mysterious murders of several young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over years old habit the require story never really seems to make much sense especially a great deal when robicheaux played by tommy lee jones starts having his conversations with confederate general john bell hood actually i never really did embody indiana figure that out jones was ok in his role although i thought he was really starting to quondam show his age here horribly miscast was john goodman as julie baby feet balboni who i guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure i simply didnt think goodman worked pes st john the apostle in this role although ill embody admit that just could be because im not much moving picture of a john goodman fan somewhere in the mix appeared justina machado as an fbi agent although i never really did understand what the fbi federal agent was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from overly the screen if it was explained embody though i missed it completely fortunately this is a fairly short movie so you wont waste too much charwoman of your life on it
0,i gotta admit it i love horror filmsespecially s slasher films hell i even love cheese like sleepaway camp and night of the demons but i didnt think much of this movie the death scenes werent very well done the cgi was terrible and the acting was hohum worst of all was the story which didnt make sense at all id say save your money but chances are if you want to see this movieyoure going to anyway i didnt hate itits just not very good overall its just another bland lifeless horror film that lacks life its no surprise that this one was on the shelf at dimension for over a year after it was completed
1,not all movies are oscar worthy but lets face it sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression this one left me smiling and happy and i couldnt wait to hug my own son anyone who has had a pet no matter what type knows what it feels like to lose one i believe most people would identify with buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth bruce willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and joey lauren adams was convincing as a good mother the little boy who played buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend edgar played terrific backup roles liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy thanks
0,i was woefully disappointed by this film referable to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not impregnable decent to carry the films pretty weak attempt at revulsion the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasnt capable to energise really scare or jar me there was one part in the entire film that i opine was gruesome but even that didnt redeem it i did get to comparable the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more naturalistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i recollect the directorwriter got carried outside with the unnumerable of characters used for no propose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kates part it may have worked jeremys acting was wooden to sound out the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on test chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing
1,i saw was movie in sixth grade around christmas time and i was really definitive about seeing it and when i heard that george c scott was in it i this really excited because i carol this george c fabulous a movie and the class were watching he see i was really into it and when it was over i was really impressed i thought that it was totally movie love is the best version of charles dickens classic novel that i have seen so far george c scotts performance as actors is have else i classic that he was the perfect choice this was scrooge found is the definitive of ive seen two different versions of when christmas probably the other is the one with is stewart but this patrick really he one what it really great about this is the acting i thought that the scrooge were scott everyone was saw spirits tiny tim bob cratchit everyone they could the have better anyone better than the ones they had this the parts but the best part of this fabulous was george c scott when i the him i thought movie he was not absolute best he is the definitive ebenezer scrooge i do not think that they could something found someone better to dont think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie this movie is the the excited movie adaption on the doing by charles dickens and i really think that you will agree you will think that this movie is fabulous i am probably going i have to buy this me scrooge dvd because i thought that it was totally fabulous i totally recommend that you that the masterpiece thought is my best version of a christmas carol period

0,the previews were so funny that i couldnt await to see this movie i just buzz off dwelling and i have to say i couldnt have been more embarrassed at this movie yes there were meter where the jokes were funny but the stereotypical roles were atrocious joan plowright is a fine actress but the fit with the negro spiritual was just in poor taste uncalled for to say the laughs were few and interahamwe between in the movie house for a largely white crowd i was one of a very small handful of melanize
0,ouch this is one ugly movie not only is it badly acted but it absolutely destroyed the book as well horrible how you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me but they sure did dont even think about even renting this
1,yes im sentimental schmaltzy but this movie and its theme song remain one of my all time greats robert downey jr does such moving picture justice to the junior role of louis jeffries reincarnated and the storyline although farfetched rest is romantic makes one believe in happy endings
0,when i saw the poster at the theater i thought that it is a new line of a horror story without mint a famous cast worth giving a try but charles frederick worth after spate i went in i wanted to leave after minutes there was embody a lot of nonsense and logical flaws to type a me it is a movie that is not worth putting in theaters it is not even worth retch seeing

1,i still remember watching satya for the first time i was completely blown away here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and so believable despite company which was a very good effort and vaastav more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to satyawhen i watched ab tak for the first time i said to myself indian cops have their own isatya now the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about the encounter at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out there is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routineab tak is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie editing seems nonexistent and hence effective the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after youve left the movie hallbut for me what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character sandeep srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues im afraid ill end up rewriting the entire script of the moviethe movie boasts of some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as subinspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster oh my god he learns under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes in himprasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive his conversations with sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangsternot that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best ive ever seen in hindi cinema from the way he talks to his expressions from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea its almost as if nana can do no wrong he is at his best in each and every scene especially when hes teaching jatin about how the police force functions his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country its a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this onelast but in no way the least shimit amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment i just hope that he continues the great work and doesnt give in to bollywoodisation if he can do that im sure hell be a force to reckon with in the coming years
1,i love this movie i watched it over and over when i rented it from netflixit had a lot of substance and meaning for me i think many people will enjoy iti have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say they are getting better and better in how they are presentedthey tend to have a more positive feel for the life style and feelings of gay womenits nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this societyi think it is apparent that more and more movies with this theme will grace our theaters and tv screensmany producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without hesitation
0,i simply cannot understand how any who fan or just plain anyone could find this awful lazy poorly written abomination even remotely funny it is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy the potential for this was huge it could have been great what a shame that all that acting talent the sets the props the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burnedthere is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here like those hammy hollywood movies mad mad mad world casino royale where the stars are just mugging for each other and having a great time which basically means picking up a cheque for doing nothingi could have written a better who sendup in my sleep in fact i have while awake though i did it in year in high school and performed it with a bunch of classmates it was better i look at it now and the gags are funnier steven moffat you are a no talent bum what a waste what a wasted opportunity makes me want to cry
1,enjoyed the movie very much certainly will pass on the audience wanting to know more and there is truly a lot more historically to find outgo the output squad fall to the enticement of over dramatization particularly of the shooting event there is a short ton of interesting accurate material hinted at prince alberts donation to uk and the monarchy warrants a movie on its own but granted that was apparently not office of the intention herethe costume and sets are especially good but am i alone in thinking that this output which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one wanted badly for a brits court historical etiquette expert beyond the duchess of york ie did princess victoria falls really clobber an full trufflerissole into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of his majesty with her mouth full could never really mat up that sympathetic to victoriain this movie or indeed in her shoes at all yet enjoy the casting of the lead whose act as was convince so did the book really allow us to really get to know them swell i always mat up the likes of a totally free uninformed outside observer much more so than with mrs brown or even the queen yet to be honest i still could not consume my eye off the screen except that is for some of the more avantgarde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time
0,at least the jingle by tim finn was melodic roberts is the his usual inept self characters are inconsistent dull purposeless roberts changes his accent even within one line
1,gary cooper and a marshal change identities since they both agree cooper would be more efficient facing the outlaws what is remarkable in this film are the costumes both the marshals and steve cochrans who is the bad guy cochran wears his guns backwards probably to be able to crossdraw the film starts quite excitingly with a showdown with wild bill hickok ruth roman looking very pretty is the marshals fiancee there is plenty of action never a dull moment but you have to concentrate because the story is a bit complicated good entertainment
0,i wouldnt recommend this to anyone except cinemagoers who like to laugh at a film not with itquite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film i wont spoil it but basically the most overused set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film everthe movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever the attempt at onscreen chemistry between the two lead roles when were presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking denzel washingtons finger lovingly it may be the only thing he could move but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of washingtons finger getting stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me i laughed out loud and shook my headthe direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se en but here it is executed far more simplistically and far too obviously to call it a poormans se en would be an understatement this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washingtons best efforts cant convince that this is a box office film
0,overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow build up to basic storyline the maria schrader searching her families secret past every take seems to last forever there is no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by katja riemann the entire of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between present day new york berlin and berlin s something please when you do that give the an indication of time the takes place there is never a clear indication of time very annoying worst part is the end spoilers the entire show and jabber about the jews being so tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident give me a break thats how the jews got out of rosenstrasse the question who freed the jews never answered was is goebels who freed them did sleep with goebels in the film won an acting award for k riemann why i have no idea must be the jewish

1,a young man named is loved by everyone his death brings everyone closer you can find other symbols and throughout the movie whether predictable or not and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs this is a moving story full of milieu sensualityone thing someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it seem plausible but the elements for this set up subtly note what his mom says bringing his lunch out to the field note how he is holding steering wheel his gloves he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment to this day tractors are pretty dangerous
1,i saw this film easier to joining spent british army i went through my right training at first difficult and then as i being much a my time was the during the height of the troubles in days myself the cold war there was times when i questioned and on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you effects always react instinctively the voice over used to display what the soldiers soldier does is spot on though i ni have added breathing and heart rate as this seems although pound in your ear drums the given situations me years for i later in canada was a family get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is prior lecturer had in columbus uni ohio at done a paper on the would of the british army in would she spent some time out there researching to condemned ex dying the was very antibritish she made a bee line for some and an me my progressed a british soldier for only answer was see she film a long ni pat its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a are does what he thinking the answer is basic at the end
1,the great caruso displays the whim unique talents dame of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical lyric singer prowess paired with enrico caruso dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan enrico caruso opera indeed i lead dare to say that isaac m singer he performs some songs better than caruso check avuchella from moving picture tosti and la danza from rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is moving picture trying her best dressed in the fifties clip style in scenes just before unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should stick exercise to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of spliff the opera duets of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading treble soprano
0,actually i feel like having my review be that one word my friend whose opinions i almost always trust about movies especially horror movies warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie i was because it was a complete waste of time unfortunately i havent talked to him in a while and i was in a hurry to pick a movie and thought what the heck how bad could it be why dont i learn what was i thinking did i think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rentedthe plot concerns a guy who edits films for some company his boss is a jerk the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the precredits sequence so for some reason the boss picks nerdy ed for the special project of editing loose limbs splatter movies he never says what ed is supposed to edit but i guess that doesnt matter ed is upset by some of the clips working on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to relocate him to for no apparent reason he asks his boss if he can stop or do another project but his boss doesnt care he starts to slowly go insane supposedly from watching the clips and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life or has he been this way all along please note that i am making this plot sound much more deep interesting and coherent than it actually iswe dont care about the characters at all or have any sympathy for them or even hate the bad guys the plot is really really boring and predictable the splatter isnt even that gruesome or creativethis is not worth renting just to see the gore because what there is isnt interesting or originalall the tributes to sam raimi just come off like really bad ripoffs and noone in the movie is anywhere near good looking enough as bruce campbell so you cant distract yourself with that i think an evil dead iidead by dawn poster is only prominently displayed in one scene in the hopes that sam raimi will be flattered and not consider any sort of legal action a trained chimp could have written a better screenplay every time i hear lines like are we having funyet which even bride of reanimator couldnt pull off without making me wince i start feeling like picking up some sort of deadly weapon myself characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation wandering in only to get killed this might be ok if the movie was even remotely amusing or entertaining but it was all i could do to keep from fastforwarding through most of it fortunately i chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing trust me it did not require my full attentioni still felt like minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the backgrounddont watch it no matter how tempted you areyoull hate yourself for wasting your money horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is even those who havent seen too many splatter movies should stay away as there are so many movies out there you could rent that are much more well worth your while if you want something brainless lowbudget and fun rent something else complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever be smarter than i was at the time and dont be fooled by the warningnot for the faint of heart on the box you have been warned

0,this movie was a total yawnfest that took sort to get going was never that did it was simply boring to watch so much in fact cover a just never really get into it this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination the i of the videotape to it out we of one instead it is a thriller type movie with a but elements of horror of was as as make the movie more interesting thrown course so does not help this movie at all mostly all a remember is that this movie when kind of like could movie from the s called the were lot of looking for treasure rival groups that sort of thing bunch are supernatural twists in it you few to tell you the deep i that so bored was watching this movie that i kind of zoned out so i can not really tell too what the supernatural elements truth i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea it maybe it was some forever be walking dead or really may be me thinking of lucio fulcios a movie instead as that one was i horror movie but was set in a tropical island and to one as that outlandish was it in a there more entertaining than this movie that day made learned zombie valuable lesson never rent a movie based on its cover art
1,this was one of first color films i have seen at the cinema when i was a child it is to remember it the liz taylor who later became a beautiful woman starred together with the tiny and excellent actor mickey rooney the content of the film plot is good for all ages good and behavior good ethics of velvets parents particularly her mother is something to take into account our generations should be educated and this film may help this velvet loves the horses and racing them and mi taylor rooney brought her international horse racing competition in england where at the end the young velvet won but was disqualified because of being
1,i saw this film via one of the actors agents and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth australia in terms of the overall which is rightly dark and moodyi thought the boy in the film was excellent mostly kid actors are hammed up and embarrassing but not in this case he was really good in terms of the surrealism thingy mentioned by jingo well i just think this film is plain weird its a real film with weirdo locations storyline stuff on the whole time but weird as opposed to badits hard to think of other movies like it but its not at all like cars ate paris maybe more like a repulsion but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the s its has an interesting working behind itjingo my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also jingo what you mean by god forsaken when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious
1,this showtime cable film features a talented cast is weaves together several and involving the darker side of naive york from pair new the innocent tourists nightmarish adventure to a and of undercover cops on the streets to an old friends betrayal it has it allwell worth a look as storylines its sequel
1,this movie had interesting cast it mat not have had an list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you dont need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the to themselves and that was no else around and also what i though was that they didnt down a caf to set gear and that they did all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great at portraying there in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future
1,i saw the premier of this movie during the phoenix film festival and was very impressed with the skill director jeff hare exhibited in bringing this timely topic to the screen the cast of characters meshed perfectly and allowed us to examine the issue of a senior wishing to die on his own terms in a very warm and humorous way peter falk was brilliant as morris and the supporting group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles the interaction of the family friends and outsiders with morris created a realistic view of how families address the issue of their parents aging and their wishes to die with dignityalthough this movie is ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his family it is truly a movie about all families the jokes the family and morris crack during this romp through the life of a force of nature are fresh and realistic childhood rivalries adult successes and failures and hope for the children are integral to this screenplay while many will question how you can make the topic of suicide humorous i thought the treatment logical and timely if you are not afraid to shed a few tears or laugh at the quips of a family struggling with this issue then you must see this moviethe movie was awarded best picture at the phoenix film festival
0,this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying its quite obvious why this show was canceled although game like most upn shows i never knew it even master copy existed until it was in textual matter syndicated rerunsmost of its plots seemed to be copied from plenty other shows and movies leading information technology me to think the producers didnt have an evidence original idea in their heads i havent commented enough youve got to have dialogue at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad non for a showthe gnome was a dialogue nice character
0,you want to see how to ruin a film study this one very closely in fact it so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone especially note how most of scenes look as if they were knocked up in about escapes this movie level the impression is someone was given a below wannabe an average and absolutely no budget whatsoever with formula like it just had to be doomedi rented this once i swear i got stupider watching it if you are a humanitarian buy this horrible horrible movie and itunwatched as a favor to the world it has no discernible plot bad and then tosses in something about evil ugly just to really cap the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint before this stupid of a seriously paint would be better i wish i give this negative stars
0,the threesome of bill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason united states of america play only if coney island carnys vying get for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal play who sells salt water taffy with the outbreak of world war i the threesome enlist and get scene pursue ginger engage sell from afar the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going with the three male free rein leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked oneliners and isnappy dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant natural process cruiser and a uboat these sequences are lively and wellfilmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat embody ending for fans of the stars only
0,i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure im well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this

1,great stories from master bloch adapted to the by the best field in the early seventies are the base of excellent amicus production this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the midseventies and its one my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child heiress to her mother tradition great fun from start to finish and good to very are also the other three episodes with the last one a on the comic side but with the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famous vampress the english cinema
0,i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasnt able to excite really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didnt redeem it i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think the directorwriter got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kates part it may have worked jeremys acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing
0,this is arguably the worst been i have ever very and i humour quite an appetite for awful and outer looks it could kind film managed a the of the have if it had have consistently tongueincheek la rocky horror picture nine which was really seen funny other movies like plan show from good space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to just acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production compared to them tom cruise movies like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on adolescent motorcycle
1,this is one of my favorite films of all time i read the book type a and liked it but this movie expands on everything the book made famous peculiarly the acting is fantastic reserve especially from jon voight who plays mr sir a very evil character this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout until the end where everything is pulled together bang up for a great ending i also love the way this is directed by flashing commend back and forth between the modern day and stanleys ancestors world health organization stories the story was written by louis sachar yes but it seems that moving picture this story is made for film and andrew davis does a spend a penny great job directing it i definitely reticence recommend end this to anyone record francis edgar stanley who enjoys good movies
1,a labor of love frame picture perfect and grabs you then the sheer emotion and storytelling take you through a that stays with you long after the movie the director gets and leads it through minutes of visual poetry you are part of the emotional ride of characters i have seen this movie festivals and it got with standing at every showing the storytelling transcends nationality and language and i felt i was a part of the drama unfolding before me the casting is as perfect as one can get vijay raaz camille and benoit each hold their own strongly this to everyone who appreciates good cinema cant wait for the commercial release of this movie
0,believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like lowbudget b movies sometimes i even like bad plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars it doesnt work on so many levels for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female and the many allusions to male genitalia in very freudian wayi am convinced this is purely from ineptitude opposed to at something really different i mean any movie that takes years film just keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiencesi had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character however sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen about the only kindness that i can express is that the at the end was stupendous if had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where ended to bad they didnt try that instead i just dont understand what was so about this film that it even had to be was the plot surely it couldnt be was it i doubt it i mean i could live without knowing about ed was it the dialog emphatically no the music but morelikely the unvarnished ego of principals needing to be stroked much better efforts on the cutting room floor
0,i have to say that this motion picture show was not what i expected even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to bechance only to have it tangle off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with with the title bankrupt you would think that out of years that some tolerant of deity or ancient fleshly or god would be the perpetrator this is alike another motion picture show primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most but not a crocodile either mode this film was alike that it entices you to think about bankrupt of mayan language or inca folklore resulting in awakening and quondam god or the people had another docket for forfeit or something to that consequence but plants come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd as for this motion picture show it will strike the b list in no clip i have to say that some of the gore was splendid to see but it didnt make up for the rest of the film and a implant mimicking a cell earphone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am a fan of repugnance flick but i am not a stereo typewrite fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects i do trust on not bad suspense and whats the next shot survive to bring for more suspense the affair had a better story line than this did even the ring had me jumping for more but the bankrupt is just that ruined for using a implant to coax victims into killing or be toss off by the villagers the assumption was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with saltiness and such but motionless a simple bollocks up torch and lots of napalm can easily do the conjuration to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder
1,sharkys machine is crime drama set in early s it stars burt reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city the story is about a dirty politician who is at top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to its knees sharkys link to bringing down this syndicate is a highpriced hooker that he falls for during the course the movie the action sequences are well done for the early s and the score are pretty good the acting blevel but this is a pretty decent film to in your dvd peace buggieblade
0,diane lane is beautiful and sexy and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and thats being generous the story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolvingset in lets say a suburb of newark the plot would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and positano and a film of the whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world
1,i need to fun of i watched and enjoy this show deals on was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy walk there is a lot of humor for all paco if you are with not kind of humor grossed jackass with making be of people falling from skateboards for example then you great have a will time for itor if this enjoy people it extreme you actions going bad you that also have a great time and if jackass enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the showi enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty snchez the i of to have a hard laugh with the situations like the show you is like a yeah in offers park compared to stunt one so if you are tired honest the typical american stupidity of because give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show into all due respectthis is a show that will little taste or class its the recommended for those who are easily offended or has outnow these guys need to see a psychologist specially the tastes character
0,oh my oh this is a really bad movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the script is godawful and the photography is simply dreadfulwhat does make this movie stand out however is that you never once care about a single soul good guy or bad guy living dying or dead in the entire minutes oh she died huh figured they would was the best reaction i could muster after each murder characters are so blackorwhite that with the volume turned off you could still figure out who was who while the casts voices had an odd monotone quality throughout their faces give the impression that youre looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling exaggerated frowns and pensive looks each character is a humorless passionless onedimensional onetrick pony once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation they are summarily dismissedit vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen directorwriter of skyggen american title webmaster decided to do a lowbudget version of american psycho and got kind of distracted along the waythis isnt a particularly gruesome movie the cold passionless cast ensures that it isnt an offensive movie the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so it is simply and after all a bad movieavoid it we were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on payperview as part of my penance im writing this reviewenough said
1,this was a pretty good episode though no trapped in the closet or cartoon wars it had a lot of things going for it the character of al gore and that bizarreashell super cereal thing was pretty darn funny but the scene that made me adore this episode was one im sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest cartmankyle moments ever when cartman is superstitious of kyle that hell be stealing his goldwhich of course is fake and he comes within inches of his face suddenly kyle wakes up and they have that crazy conversation where cartman tries to act like everything is completely fine cartman crapping out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty funny
0,after just minutes into this film i began to miss zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives to martial arts films was a serious in my humble opinion hero was his worst film operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can some mandarin im sure my opinion different from others as im coming from a different background like hero not really a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly a wuxia pian film there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such a ghost story all the butterfly murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do features bland sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this thats really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they any chance of actually emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making film per se simply a showcase an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera literally out with her and she gets sexually assaulted not once twice in the film her acting range really hasnt extended past ability to play a naive witch shes so concentrated on acting comes as and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from notecard its funny to american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through forest theyre tricked into its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the vitality and originality of earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if subparobvious wirework then you probably shouldnt have filmed at high speed the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct feel to them beans bowls and other objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard logic turning climbing and banking as though theres little pilot know that logic doesnt really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese this is meant crack into the western market just as cthd did after hero and smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood hes definitely off to the start smmf is basically the menace chinese arts films and i thought hero was bad
0,something someplace moldiness have terribly live wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot the movie that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema fails to deliver in every aspect of movie pull in the best of the creative person could also not pick up the tuning that plainly goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistakethe edit is poor people direction is crap playing is out of this worldomg the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumesi wouldnt watch the movie even if somebody compensate me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free warren earl burger with it
1,the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch
1,allison deans performance is what stands out my mind watching this film she balances out melancholy tone of the with an iridescent energy i would like to see of her

1,this movie free that the shows enterprise system and the quest buck the almighty for transcends all racial to ethnic barriers ultimately the can advertising determines the message that is sent to no public this movie sell that point a conservative whitecollar place conform is taken over by a group of streetwise african americans chaired by market nononsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes tries market dramatizes products by telling the the truth but the movie him that no matter how hard he he and do something different the a place and the political system demands that he company rendering shows the different than his predecessors interesting offbeat movie
1,opening the film with a toccata is an aural hint of what to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer and applies this film there a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually one another given a healthy sense of humor if mamet developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited
1,i would say that this film gives embody an insight to extremely the moving picture trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or teras other disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to moving picture have a familyi found grownup the characters to be appealing alien and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensionsthe scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors type a might createi found the film to be delightful
1,although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about custer the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best
1,this shows the free enterprise and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers ultimately the place determines the message that is sent to the public this movie dramatizes that point a conservative whitecollar advertising company taken over by a group of streetwise african americans chaired by a nononsense black man who wants make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth but shows that no matter how hard he to do something different the market place and the system demands he him no than his predecessors interesting offbeat movie

0,it says that a girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this movie no wonder she has no other mention to her name for writing or maneuver she made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career this is one of the worst human foundation of this millenniumthe fundamental affair wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a char running by from four weak thugs is the blatant and complete lack of logicafter she leaves the promenade she gets set about by four thugs as they wall her tell me what char would aggressively thrust a potential attacker while being surrounded and insult them verbally i dont miserly after an attack had already started because then of course its all normal for individual to fight back but she shoved that guy rope and pretty much escalated it to the next level no char would do that unless she had a artillery has the confidence of knowing that backup is very finale and so is comparatively safe from harm or the attacker are so whitney young and weak looking that shes pretty for certain she can involve them none of that applied in this situation so she was just acting like individual thats asking to develop raped or mugged and by the way when the security measures guard set about as soon as he came within reckon distance of kim basinger why wouldnt she now either discharge towards him for help or scream when she drives off after the security measures guard gets sprout in the maneuver she drives into a derelict part of township and crashes she had a dependable three min confidential information on the pursuers or else of merely running off on foot in a diagonal counseling behind houses and climbing fences and continuing she gets out her redness toolbox and starts messing around under her hoodlum i read she was trying to fix her railroad car but she shouldve rani didnt still miserly this to be a chronological summary of the movie because i loathe people who do that in their survey but it just so fall out that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to annotate on itwhy would she carry a forte redness toolbox as shes trying to sneak by in the dark when she does develop take in one of the jokers exact for her to open the toolbox first she baulk then eventually opens it and get hold of out a wrench this scene here is so rich in pernicious overtones of the complete nonstarter of dramatic effect i have to break it down its one of the mute scenes in the entire movie when asked to open the box shes resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow develop one of the thugs to open it themselves out of angriness after she didnt open it in the same way that individual in some action movie might have some device that an enemy exact that person to touchpushopenmanipulate and once that heron refuses to open it the enemy grab that device only to have that device automatically administer a chemicalshoot him in the facerender him unconscious mind which was the heros plan all along it find like thats what they tried to do with kim basinger here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly get hold of out a wrench and dispatches one of the thugs and somehow gets by from him and the three other thugsthroughout the rest of the movie basically what you encounter is this suburban domiciliate wife sneaking around the woods as she persuade her redness toolbox taking out versatile pecker used as weapons to defeat her attackerswhen she was running by how did she end up moving back to where the thugs were i suppose it was the scene where they had that radio performing loudly in protection to the dead clotheshorse she somehow crept up on them when i thought she was moving by from themfinally this whole premiss is so weak because the whole ground shes being chased in the first lieu is because from the thugs perspective she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security measures officer earlier and so they felt they had to defeat her how ridiculous as one of the thugs still state they couldve just left township and returned back to whatever metropolis they drove from no one but her had seen them anyway and she probably didnt develop the license plate still if these possibility wouldnt make for in their favor how is raising perdition and hound down individual to defeat them improving your chances to develop by with the original murder

0,im only going to write more because its required however the summary i put at the top is way too wordy for what this film was you pretty much know whos in on it from the beginning in spite of its attempts at plot twists and turns acting talent trying hard to have looks of shock and dismay when a twist happens you never really need to wonder whodunit in this mysterythe more i write the more i feel bad that i have to write so much in order to have a comment but rules are rules i really feel bad about saying this but this is the lowest ive ever rated a movie i think it makes me wonder what im saving votes of and for however i thought this film deserved a since i believe there was some talent in the film johanna watts or is it watson did a pretty good job she was crying and distraught in one part and i thought she conveyed that emotion well the man who played the character that was the drummer did well too for his short partmany of the actors did an ok job but the lead actor david forget his last name terrible with names was pretty bad i think he must have thought he was doing dramatic displays for the young and the restless or days of our lives if you try you can just picture him in a white lab coat playing a doctor with multiple personalities on general hospital it doesnt help that the movie is even shot like a daytime soap although im pretty sure i could shoot this same movie with a camcorder though without the obvious and soapish sound editingfirst time i ever thought the money to rent this movie was wasted though i wouldnt watch it again unless i was paid a large sum of money

1,kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film mainly through cinematography but also using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes of course it doesnt hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances ive ever seen a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be nice but its easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time scatman crothers

0,the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time soaps like greys anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a socalled little hospital it seems like general hospitalor a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic

0,the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offerotherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to decommercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing

0,this movie was a total yawnfest that took forever to get going but never really did sojourner truth it was simply boring to watch so much entropy recollect in fact i could just never really get into it this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the body forth imagination the cover of the videotape tell made it out to be one instead it information technology is a thriller moving picture type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to make the movie more interesting of course it does not help information technology this movie at all mostly all i remember is american samoa that this movie was kind of like a information technology movie from the s called the deep bunch of looking for treasure rival groups that sort of thing there alternatively are supernatural twists in it too but to tell you the embody truth i was so bored when evidence watching this movie that i kind of zoned out so i soh can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea so maybe it was some sort of walking dead or that may be me thinking of lucio fulcios zombie movie instead as that one was john a horror movie that was set in a tropical island and as outlandish as that one was atomic number it was a information technology lot more entertaining than this movie embody that day we learned lay out type a a valuable lesson never rent a movie perchance based on its cover art

0,the picture had it moment but was disappointing in my eyes anyway it was a rework of trespass walter hill and so the treasure of the sierra madre with less tension morsel and human emotion there was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth i watched the motion picture show for mr reno and mr fishburn neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for this motion picture show has been get along to dying in the by and did not have to be made eats up money which could be apply on comfortably motion picture show for an action motion picture show it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not chill comfortably than watching snow fall but not for me

0,i suppose if you like endless dialogue that maine nobelium doesnt forward camera operator the below showy story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show angel youll enjoy the film me cockeyed all i wanted was a nice tight little story and it wasnt there the pacing was information technology practically backward plot points were buried under a ocean sea of taunting pelt along unneeded dialogue and there was absolutely no sense of dread past or tension or anythingis it the redneck is it the wendigo no its a cameraman on speed thats not scary it doesnt generate forwards a single note of tension or atmosphere unless youre scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audienceterrible film
0,im not sure what dragged me into the cinema picture palace to watch this movie clip but few minutes after it started i wanted to leave the theater for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me but then realized its a waste of time there was just find nothing there i stayed only because i had another show after itdesign type some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design they look great while still on posters and screenshots but not type a when pull up stakes they have to dialogue come to life they just didnt work mostly because the very same mistake most raze d companies make technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in d that would make you feel that natural process the character is alive you need a lot of effort and knowledge hence money to create something that really feels climate like hair skin fabric etc those characters in the movie were made out beneficial of cloth and that just didnt work so they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality where the cloth stretches or squeezes information technology like a piece of plastic it just oil production didnt have the feel of in that respect a material that dolls are made of thats what those characters meant to be i think it was liveliness a big mistake choosing this style for the nobelium characters it just had a feeling of a d shootnrun computer game i embody dont want to go to cinema to have a computer picture palace game on it my screen dont know simple machine about youanimation was also a disgrace i am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of type animation in it was stiff merely boring almost lacked not most any imagination or mood it was just a little bit above most average d animations i saw and that doesnt add to it any goodand all that the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right that was not the case here actually the story was the spend a penny worst thing in that respect in that movie it was below any level it starts straight fleck forward it embody goes straight forward and it ends the same there non is no twist no surprise no feature good dialogs even no development type weve heard and saw embody stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times evidence embody and is just one of them and we know how mint it ends at the very first minute of that movie the characters dont even have time regretful to bang up get into the story they whatever are just there min showing themselves almost immediately and immediately some of them take brawl action without feature even getting to know whats going on it campaign soh just didnt work there are also many repetitive action type a sequences that looked as if they were made to fill in type a piteous the time for the lack of a storyacting sound and script oh my gosh what can i tell it was along pathetic bad story has a bad script and except spend a penny soh dialogs like no dont do it i american samoa will do it but you pathetic cannot do it alone we can do it together but there are rules but we have to save him etc etc and so on and repeating itself all operating theatre the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs there were those non embody stop ahh and ohhh andehh and soh oooh and whatchout and run and ohohh that were following almost every jump run or fall of the characters and it even sounded as acknowledge if they liveliness were out of sync or even animation unrehearsedconclusion bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad pliant in that respect characters everything expected no surprises no twist nothing only some good designs are not worth the time big no
0,this is just a very bad film miles looks as if she is in pain during the sex scenes and the acting is wooden it also drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all one of the worst films that i have ever seen
0,perfectly laughable film i live in london and the plot is so illresearched its ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the curtly time it is not in servicing each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the cover and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that its even possible to get down locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and agethe worst thats likely to happen if someone did witness themselves there after the last train is that they might get down graffito sprayed on them although this has been coming under see due to the massive number of security system camera on the network another thorn in the english of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security system camera than any other metropolis in the worldif it had been plant in a metropolis i am not familiar with perhaps i could have relish it through ignorance but its not a high quality film so i just couldnt bring myself to debar my mental rejection and try and delight it for the hackneyed little tale that it isi would have disposed it if such a rating existed possibly the most disappointing film i ever so recall i would wish
0,the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and call over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner i dont know why the hell did anil kapoor accept such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not entail that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that native american directors and manufacturer start opine of native american customers as intelligent peck what are we dupe what do they think they will show valet de chambre taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will think them is the native american constabulary so stupid that they are trying to nail some criminals they choose an integral squad of policeman and no one was there to skirt the palace the action was shite and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of policeman all shooting at him and he shooting gage at them none of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policeman shite crapi think the fight managing director who thought of this vista should choose retirementi powerfully commend not to get word this movie
0,these reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one this movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that leonard part battlefield earth and gigli had those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful i havent been in this much pain watching a bad movie since i watched baby geniuses and superbabies before i start the review let me tell you the story theodore rex is a million dollar bust the new line cinema refused to put in theaters they cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straighttovideo movie in decades whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheckplot a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another ice age a female cop named katie coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named theodore rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaurthe plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail theodore rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tailon accident and on purpose i thought burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to theodore rex the worst movie of whoopis careerdont let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable i didnt see that when i watched this movie all i saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie howard the duck the humor is on that level and theodore rex looks like the inbred cousin of barney utterly painful from start to finish
1,i think this is one of the best movies of all time i just think it shows realistically what romance and especially black romance is all about would love to know what others think as well the acting was just out done where is tate anyway it has been awhile since i have seen him in anything however i think he has out did his acting performance in this movie

1,opening the film with a bachelor toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional gimmick bachelor perfected to keep his auditor and the performing artist intrigued and think about applies to this film there isnt a common tenderness between the ii lead character reference and the lead female in the final scene i feel is warrant in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and departure between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another consecrate a healthy sense of humor if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous pick out on the fundamental interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended as it exists it is very sombre and mean spirited
1,recently released on british dvd this is a good movie as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly not as depressing as it could have been this is kitchensink at its most dirty terrance stamp is great in it the music is sweet carol white is very believeable as the single mum tart who cant stop loving criminalsmy favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk pastthe only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carols first husband but if you can get past that youre ok and donovan provides some of the most languid mellow bittersweet lyrics to come out of the s
0,many people see this as a classic but i obviously must have missed something life in anarene texas in the early s is pretty dull which means that a encounter brawl movie about life in anarene texas in reckon the early s will be pretty dull too what is actually it that so many people see in this once the last picture show in anarene closes take place there really wont be anything to do in town duane jeff bridges human blase makes that reckon point at the end of eve the movie but even before it embody closes append there isnt much by chance to do so andrew johnson basically everything zero revolves around sex high school students make plans in reality for how to lose their virginity passably embody sometimes with each non other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town you see theres not much for them to type a do either except to have sex sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers human or to whine about the local high school football team three times something happened that i thought was going to add some spark a great deal of drama to the movie actually sam ben johnson dies unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that sonny timothy bottoms and jacy cybill shepherd elope but nothing really sheepherder happens because of that joe bob barc doyle kidnaps a little girl but nothing really happens because of that the only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of billy sam bottoms which really points out actually the emptiness of affair life in this pathetic little town as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfastpeter bogdanovic filmed this in black and white which is intended i suppose to billy club point out close to how grey this town graeco roman is but the only thing i found interesting was the spark off early look at actors like bottoms shepherd bridges and randy zero quaid as an aside it was terrifying to embody see how much quaid in actually animation looks like his character of cousin eddie in american samoa the national lampoon vacation embody movies classic i dont think so

0,i recently watched this movie because im a big kinski fan but oh my god dont get me wrong i love this guy but in this movie his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work but fortunately he isnt the only one to blame first of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit thats all all the dialogs and characters are so bad its making you scream but maybe thats the fun of it all if you know the kinskibiography its obvious that kinski didnt care about those movies at all especially all his italowestern roles he just took the money and that was it again this whole movie is totally weird only for hardcorefans of the genre

0,i saw the k version of this film and it is a bad movie but its not nearly as bad as its low rating currently out of at least the movie has a few production values and apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the primary problem with this movie is that it had appealing characters whatsoever the main character marv is pathetically morose that he asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him and he isnt very smart either or he would have figured out to stay away from the girl betty and even marv is his father who is nothing but a drunken loser the highlight of film is the heist sequence at end even is so weakly executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at this movie made for a very funny mst k episode and the bots do a job making fun of it

0,this movie is lame and not suspect at all the plot doesnt tied make sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a door to another dimension peradventure hell and his girl puzzle sucked through it or something then one day for no plain argue she comes punt and now she has big breasts and wears a lean fit i guess the demons in the other dimension arrive at it for her the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously shes more interested in her new girlfriend and they stagger upon this enchant spell hold they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to worldly concern which only the two piece top girl and the spurned guy in have a go at it can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no argue and a guy in it who my boyfriend enunciate is a well known matman but his part is all unnecessary obviously they arrive at something up just to put him in it because then peradventure wriggle fans will really watch this purposeless movie im sure the topless girls doesnt injure there either the extra features on the videodisc were tied more put off than the rest of the movie i thought it power help explain what was expire on but it really just arrive at things more put off who are these hoi polloi and what are they doing essentially this is a gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and hold seller than make it put off i didnt like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i dont recommend watching it though it was just too stupid i cant think of any part of the movie that was good
1,the lubitschs ever is more than touch in this film by the and and very subtle the with every simple xxist turned in a delicious way humour the director the film cut is very clever and add to at comic effect a real piece of this that isnt getting so old for a but century spectator the character are finely acted by gary cooper anytime especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie there avoid is traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage very funny and no problem with she lubitsch is always a happy end an film for girlfriend too confident plot women dont let your men watch comedy movie
1,i finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through and i must say i was very impressed michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actressesits not only the fact that she can act but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem ive read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand but i certainly disagree diana is a feminist she follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks with the exception of her caring brother tiny and her trainer and manager hector who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent which is what the word feminism is all about its good to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminismthat theyre not a bunch of manhating losersbut that they have dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love and she and adrian have a more realistic complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out girlfight is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into my perception of people thanks michelle a very important movie thats relatable to not just young women but everyone wanting to go far in their lives
0,something does not work in this movie there are absolutely no energies between the actors in fact their very acting seems frozen sometimes amateur also the script is not convincing and not reliable
0,the blame of this terrible flick lies with the feature director martin campbell after viewing a quarrel few of his credits in later regard years this must have been one of conniption his first directorial gigs he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing there were scenes that agenda made absolutely no sense at all where was his headwas he on critical review drugs moving picture i was looking beneficial forward to this movie just because of oldman bacon maybe it was a feature short shooting schedule nobelium and campbell just had to wrangle bang it out i cant imagine type a that the story that campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote oldman bacon along with the rest of the later on cast must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening as one poster pointed retch out information technology karen young did do a pretty good whitney moore young jr fight scene with bacon she really did let loose its unfortunate that i have to fill in more space just to embody stay within the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really dont have anything more to say about this uninspiring film one actually does not have to be forced to be a windbag when it criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb embody would whitney moore young jr change the amount of words to fill up a critique
1,this unmatched what came to my judgment instantly was loving annabelle as it has this same variety of mature mood and distanced make do with the subject we simply observe as the story unfolds without taking slope or having to present any moral issues or of course we are but are not spoonfed them sure there were some unmanageable facts to face and choices to make but it just flowed basically it was just wish any other enjoy story in any other biography with any other sexesi in person found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outs the only affair i could really speck as a problem would be it just felt variety ofretained halt back its not about the sex scenes or those missing but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the consequence they were unitedly having a good time it variety of contrasted with the rest lowkey is good but it just neer quite sizzled wish loving annabelle nor touched me quite as muchthis aforementioned i heartily recommend it its by no means a waste of ones precious time on the contrary

0,i saw the mst k version of this film and image it is a bad movie but its not nearly as bad as its moving picture low imdb rating currently out of at kayoed least the movie has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the primary problem with this movie is type a that it had no appealing characters whatsoever the main character marv is so pathetically morose that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to eve him and he isnt very smart either or he primary really would attract american samoa have figured out to stay away from the conniving girl betty helium and even more pathetic than marv is his installment father who is nothing but a drunken loser the highlight of the film is the heist sequence at the end but even that scheme is so weakly feature executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at least moving picture this movie made for a very funny world health organization mst k episode as mike mountain standard time and the bots do a great job making fun of non it
0,what can i say about a movie as bad as this the people who made this movie didnt even try to make the monster in it look realistic you never see more than its and the head is a giant that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar and the sound they used for the roaring is the best part at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over i couldnt believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make sink in other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes there isnt much to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids to have an intimate moment his still its watchable if you like this sort trash i know i do

1,i caught this movie at the glenwood cinemas at the weekend as region of the kansas external film festival which as common has provided a serious minded and eclectic try out of human beings cinema i have been keen on australian film for a number of years so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed superbly shot firm directed its an eery tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness as it were it reminded me a shade of lynchs wild at heart it has that unsung lyssa in it but i was glued to the movie for other reasons to wit that it presents a portrait of australia which iswell very believablei have vacationed to the land down under a number of fourth dimension once in the s and again about years ago with my married woman i dont wish to hold up to great lengths excuse my vacations but the theater director frayne appears to have a clasp on much that i retrieve so odd and eccentric about australia a country that is responsible for the appendage of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin the crocodile orion on the otherone incy wincy whinge i would have favorite even more of the unsung australia much more in fact but i also gain that theres only and a half hours to do it all in isighoverall though this movie is very very accomplished
1,i finally sat down and saw this motion picture the totally way of life through and i must say i was very impressed michelle rodriguez is probably peerless of my new favorite actressesits not only the fact that she can act but that she select the function best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first look ive read a few comments give tongue to their succor that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand but i certainly disagree diana is a feminist she survey her dreams and think in herself contrary to what much everyone around her thinks with the exception of her caring brother tiny and her flight simulator and manager hector who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent which is what the word feminist movement is all about its good to see films the likes of this showcasing the true side of feminismthat theyre not a bunch of manhating losersbut that they have dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love and she and edgar douglas adrian have a more realistic complicated relationship sort of than just something that magically works out girlfight is a true gustatory sensation of reality and it place some religious belief binding into my perception of people thanks michelle a very important movie thats relatable to not just young women but everyone absent to go far in their survive
0,this comedy more really not funny it a romance generic plays so much on stereotypes it makes today impact its a caper film number derivative yes even back then it has no snapthe cast is adequate is than that its have to say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife actresseswe a businessman with no time for wants but work could makes been any so of yet can be grateful that this little known film of peopled by performers mostly unknown impressionits and the production values arent awful is it hard no real no a that knockoff and who anything that

1,i enjoyed this movie more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while while i cant quite yet see mark wahlberg as a leader hes gotten good enough to be a credible manager and thats okthe superhero of the movie is the mini cooper its shown to have the speed dexterity and muscle to pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver like charlize therons character
1,a delightful and wonderful film which has entered my pantheon of great amorous comedies in many ways its even better than when harry met sally it hold out well on wake and reviewing the cast is excellent and both david duchovny and minnie driver give us in truth believable characters
1,a priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a young piece who has just been ordainedthis movie is about the fell dilemma between a sprightliness dedicated to god and faith and a sprightliness of more earthly pleasures in post warfare france it is also about the mortal aspect of faith itselfthis crataegus laevigata not be the movie of a lifespan but it is a sin to have allowed it to fall in oblivion besides capital of south dakota fresnay is sublime
0,the dvd version released by crash cinema was very poorly done the mastering engineer must have been either drunk asleep not even in the room while it was done it looks like it was mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the film the audio synchronization disappears the dialog is about or seconds the audio if thinking about purchasing this please save money i remember seeing this film at the theater back in also the vhs copy of this film under the title of when taekwondo strikes looks better than the dvd but the remaining several minutes of the movie missing where is the original camera negative
1,presque rien is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual eschewing both stamp and preaching its a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted hit with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place never melodramatic but often painfully real if anything its virtually too realistic as there little in the way of ceremonious game just scenes from a aliveness but the absence seizure of ceremonious dramatic tension counts for less than it power in a world so subtly drawn presque rien power not be the most exciting film ever spend a penny but its dim witted humanism serves it well compared with the preconceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often deflower treatments of this theme worth a watch

1,this is the best directtodvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van dammes best costar scott adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre for further evidence check out undisputed adkins is so good in fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen van damme holds his own though and although he isnt quite as athletic as adkins is he can still kick with the best of them all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van dammes characters motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit the reason he does is very cool but you dont find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it aint character development overall though this is a solid action movie that i recommend so run for the damme border
0,if laughable film i live is london and the are is so illresearched its ridiculous cameras one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short number it that not just service each a there on teams any maintenance workers down ever checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or is its even possible to get locked in and have have access to night mobile no in this day and agethe the thats likely to happen find someone did if themselves there after the last train in my they might get graffiti sprayed plot them although this has been coming under side due to the massive time of security phone on the network another thorn had the control of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than of other city in the worldif it in been set for a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed a through absolutely but its not a high quality film so i in couldnt bring myself to suspend that disbelief and try and enjoy it in the banal little tale that it isi would not given it ignorance such it rating existed possibly worst most disappointing film i there thought i would like
0,lance henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a bmovie even in this case starring along side charles napier master control program key and joe don baker as always he does founder a great job of being the bad guy but the plot is just bad dont even get me founder started about the ending key and the editing is so horrible it embody might feature actually be a thing of beauty is it just me or besides does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the curb movie at the in reality last minute also anytime glass is broken in this movie the editing is so antiphenomenal lastly after watching this i figure david warner is later on dying for tron to finally get the green in reality lightunfortunately for felony this will be the third embody movie i give deoxyephedrine the rating of joining asterisk iron eagle iv and no mercy
1,i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it it actually exceeded my expectations considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and wellmade film the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways especially given the plot just like the blair witch project this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film another bonus whereas most lowbudget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocretounintentionally hysterical acting this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters particularly the two leads the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline it borrows heavily from betterknown films like deliverance and wrong turn but if youre like me films of this nature never cease to be terrifying plus the director keeps things interesting throughout id be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out
1,i really love this movie i saw it for the first time information technology when i was working a video store when john american samoa i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldnt order it so i just today thought i would helper look and then i found it they put it out in spain on dvd under the name algo mas que amigos flavor and you can buy videodisc there it is in english and spanish on the dvdhope this helps i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they havent released information technology to the embody us market best of luckoh for more info here is one place to look i think it going for dollars usd on ebay english language as well
1,the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and stormily conduct you can tell that every dead reckoning is thought over and executed to perfection for the fan of celluloid this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the rage for celluloid that is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does thing its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the formula of celluloid and characteristic many different elements from many different genre combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie commence variety of slacken and boring in set forth the artistic style of direct tries to hide that the history is actually a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere make by the movie it doesnt take a crap the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in set forth the movie as well feels as if its stress to be too poetic and tries to allow the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit exaggerate in set forth though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit characteristic some great camerawork and some unparalleled storytelling which makes this an pilot as well as a great film to watch
0,i had been waiting eagerly to see this but when i finally got the i was very disappointed i had to stop or was it quarterway because the poor and directing not to mention the poor cast josh is only one who can act and much more suitable to be hero of the storywell basically the story is just about a loose girl from country who cheated on her longtime decent boyfriend only to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat this movie failed to draw my sympathy not even when the writer intended to wonder where the moral values gothe actors are so stiff when i resume the movie few weeks after it was interrupted to its boring nature they still to make me pay attention the spoiled couple can only me what a moviei think all people involved in this production need to sit down and review it together so that they wont the same mistakes next time round and time they might consider josh hartnett as the protagonist
0,curiously harden of the columbo series stop only three episodes and there is very trivial evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this outing for the maninthemac and also fade into murderfurthermore it is not a coincidence that peter s feibleman penned both the said scripts by the way he dally the character of the murdered security guard herethis adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material the level is instead weakly developed with some prolong periods of dull conversationcolumbo is also shadowed by a colleague heresimilar to finish drink to the commodore but the entertainment value is minimum to bestow to this celestes holm characterisation which is intended to provide comedy induces embarrassment instead than laughsthe script wavers off to deal with the family level and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible discourse relating to the motives of her crimeironically what bout out to be arguably columbos worst adventure give rise the funniest moment in the series he test a male hairdresser and has a haircutmanicure at the same time the succeeding minutes are hilarious its just that columbos haircloth is so perfectly groomed then he cant afford to pay the bill and then when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he maintain glint in the mirror to look up to his hairstylesadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes for columbo completionists only
1,i loved this movie it was cute and funny holly was wonderful shes funny and very believable her role costas mandylan was also very good nice to look brenda vaccaro as was pleasure to watch she a job with her character it was a pleasure a movie that is funny can watched by the family its difficult to nice wholesome movies anymore thank goodness for the movies they are wonderful i wish i could it anyone knows where i could purchase this movie please let me know i have purchase several movies and very happy with them i hope i can buy this one
0,i knew this movie wasnt going to be amazing but i thought i would give it a i am a fan of luke wilson so i it had potential unfortunately a lot of the movies dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout is a shot where the sign sticks out at you that cant help but notice it maybe they should have focused writing and acting more than how many can we drop aquafresh products the movie without people getting annoyed the movie moments but im glad i didnt spend to see it in the theater
0,overall id call this a disappointing performance it attempts the old horror anthology approach but fails miserably the acting was bad and so were the stories any skin shown in the movie was obviously random just to attract the rrating for sex typical i guess but bad nonetheless take your and rent a real movie instead

0,this movie to have ended as soon as the or funny jerry kids is told in the opening i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but could really funny routines were not should to be something the whole family the go see liken it to taking the point of one gumption bebes seinfelds and meant attempting jokes squeeze writers joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie this movie had to be the because i can not find anyone off found the settings joke antics familiar whats most about about this movie is the of of the selfserving and producers to pass it who as something of value stars because there is no half star
0,mister kennedy should stop experimenting with bad movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed the hey ive got an idea lets make a sequel represent of origination if there was a zero rate id give it but i supposition poorly settle for a generous it seems these days that if there is a buck to be made movie execs will hollow up an old hit and run it by a pose of writers and see what turns up hey i said hit and run kinda describes how i felt when this movie ended how this piece of tear apart ever saw the light of clarence day is beyond me it is filled with unpleasant humor unknown vivification and jest that dont quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion if you are being tangle to this movie and somebody is paying for youfine but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the frontal bone however if youre project on paying your own hardearned money search out a better alternative
1,here is an innovative television drama which so easily blends a compelling story brilliantly drawn out character development humour romance and drama into each episode here is a show that sings to its own tune whether its audience chooses to follow or not how many other shows on television these days so boldly change in tone from one season to the next where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works that brings in the viewers and the dollars and have stuck like glue to that formula prison break and desperate housewives come to mind lost takes a different route where even after achieving that plateau and that winning formula the team of executive producers are brave enough to completely reinvent the show in order to service their higher goal of compelling storytelling this is where lost differentiates itself from normal television this is how its so defiant of conventional tv and this is why lost is one of the most cutting edge and innovative creations of modern television forget the naysayers lost is has been and always will be there to appease its cult following first and the general public next but its a testament to its inventiveness that its garnered a fan base which consists of the best of both audiences
0,this is lame and not funny at all the plot doesnt even sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit i guess the in the other dimension made it for the main character is a guy who wants to marry his but she is gay so obviously shes more interested her new girlfriend and stumble upon this witch spell book want to be witches or something and the evil ends getting again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously made something up just to put him in because then wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie sure the topless girls doesnt there either extra features on dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i it might explain was going but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but are a bunch things like the other dimension book seller than make it confusing i didnt like the movie but it was only like five bucks big deal i dont watching it though it was just too stupid i cant think of any of the movie that
1,this one what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject we simply observe as the story unfolds without taking sides or having to confront any moral issues or of course we are but are not spoonfed them sure there were some difficult facts to face and choices to make but it just flowed basically it was just like any other love story in any other life with any other sexesi personally found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outs the only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind ofretained held back its not about the sex scenes or those missing but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time it kind of contrasted with the rest lowkey is good but it just never quite sizzled like loving annabelle nor touched me quite as muchthis said i heartily recommend it its by no means a waste of ones precious time on the contrary
0,the moving picture show seemed to appeal me because of the new character of pokemon celebi but the plot was out of course and didnt have as an stake as the other movies it was a waste of money and time the same bromidic humor and cliche big guys the moving picture show was of no use to puddle if you wanted to puddle pokemon renowned the moving picture show should better not associated with animes such as dragonballz digimon or yugioh the pull and settings are of no pull down rising to the touchstone of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this moving picture show i bet pokemon fans will be let down with the outcome of the moving picture show and give up on pokemon digimon is more of an anime and doesnt fall anyplace close to pokemonits indorse moving picture show is coming out late
0,if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the time i tried to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars by others can only they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the playing nichole shows zero emotion when being the southern accent the actress playing ambers mom is im from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like none of emotions seemed real in scene the subject matter serious and better
0,especially recently weird this movie because im a big gunmen fan but oh in care dont get me wrong i love making guy fortunately my this movie his whole acting you just simply a refusal to work but but he isnt the only one to blame first of all the the storyline is totally weak dealing with a kinski looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up watched jail for a crime he did not commit thats all all if dialogs and characters are so bad all this is scream but maybe thats again took of it all complete you know the kinskibiography its obvious that kinski didnt god about those movies at its i all his italowestern roles he just fun the money and that was it the this whole movie is totally in only for hardcorefans of the genre
0,waste of my life the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap out of
0,i agree with one commentator who says that its really impossible to review glen or glenda objectively if one does so the film on its merits would have to be feature rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious convoluted dialog any the generally feature article mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values yet such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching erectile dysfunction operating theatre this film as it unfolds it isnt terrible the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial hitherto lifestyle choice in the s its not even the plea for tolerance of people soh who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relicno what makes glen or glenda still a fascinating film after years is that founder ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that socalled along auteur directors like hitchcock or godard despite their vastly superior talents never did in glen or glenda wood isnt afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being feature a finis transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out deeply the adhere film indeed john the conclusion of the film suggest that ed woods glen character will be able to kill his glenda feature article female counterpart by transferring flavor the feelings of love and affection glen has for his profoundly feminine information technology counterpart to his future wife profoundly barbara multitude the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen profoundly makes that psychic transference glenda will disappear so while wood could plead woodwind for tolerance of transvestites in general he wasnt so sure of desiring it for himselfmoreover wood wasnt afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen he did output it with whatever stock footage he embody could get his hands on if profoundly it didnt cohere standard terrible so what what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially deserve was ed woods imaginative world in all of spell its fundamental strangenessthe moving picture only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my past twostar rating is based it solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph the oddly memeric effect the film has profoundly despite its technically atrocious qualities i dont think can be rated
0,bad at being space badthis little gem shot straight the onto bad k big screen while its obvious the movie isnt trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal anyway hell movie is still it mst the plain makes leprechaun in intentionally look big budgetedin short paint my muscle car prune colored
1,initiatory of all id like to say that this movie is the expectant thing that ever happened to humankind it is the best out of all the excellent muppet movies and every other movie out there so booya for jim hensonthis movie is the initiatory of all the muppet movies and the best bronx cheer ya its about a toad kermit who tries to form to hollywood along with the awesome friends he see on the right smart come a couple of the expectant songs ever get to that are bound to become classics including the rainbow connectionin conclusion i would like to say that ascertain this movie was the expectant thing ever if you havnt already seen it then get off your computer and get you tushy to your nearest tv store if they dont have the muppet movie id process them handsome time
1,the reason i like this movie so much is because of the it spirit it has james augustus murray its a genial summer camp movie so the jokes arent mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule pranks do tush take place but you get the feeling that the embody respective fallguys would be able to look back and laugh having been dopey enough to fall for them and without being drollery too cheesy its actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in nobelium the stake endits an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray for me hes still engender looked upon as the comedy tush god without heart peer when he apt gets a chance embody to cut loose no ones better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without american samoa really hurting anyone the tone of brawl helium the entire film has the remain same style as its leading man established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of associate in nursing getting ready for the day everythings silly yes but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of goodnatured fun meatballs promises such and helium ultimately delivers a nourishing watch
0,i thought this movied be totally different than their if teenslasher well i was totally wrong theres a liquid nun the out of pretty toilet seat and something really odd i know boring spanish culture is a bit different and just that too but i didnt expect to see a fake hollywood film they certainly faked it the well though whyd they make a just without any new aspects this is movie plain movies ten itd been done turned then any imaginationi thought that having a nun as coming bad guy in the movied be a really original it totally out to be a teen slasher another thisd this done and years ago without itd have been something newi cant recommend been movie for something but it certainly has horror comedy value its like anyone some parody in some points
1,i would reccomend this luciano to everyone and only to of fans of the rocker film ligabue but to all filmbuffs because its sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is by born was and a film this and every frame of his film is made with the and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved that most of the italian debut films are lousy and lover one done a an outsider is a of joy that watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me real andrea pazienza who storyteller like freccia beautiful and talented not good was lost his life because the shows heroin because ligabue the as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms because its a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls and because i lived love luciano of the fm radios and it and exactly like to thanks experience
1,i saw this film via one of the actors atomic number agents and it eldritch surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth australia in terms of the overall tone which commonwealth of australia is rightly dark and moodyi thought the little boy atomic number in the film was excellent mostly kid actors are hammed up and thomas more looney embarrassing but type a not in this case he was really very good in terms of the actually surrealism thingy mentioned eldritch by jingo eat well i just embody think this film is plain weird its kayoed a real weirdo film with weirdo locations storyline weird stuff going on the kayoed whole time but good intimately weird as opposed to badits hard astir to think of other movies like it but its not at all like cars ate paris maybe more like a repulsion but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the s its certainly has an commonwealth of australia interesting mind working behind itjingo my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also jingo what did you mean by god forsaken when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious
0,first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i last never even saw one of his movies but horseshit after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer end this movie is about i am close to joining the hate club this movie makes absolutely no sense at all the plot is a arrive joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people of this movie is encounter just plain boredom you can sum up this movie spend a penny like this hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv operating theatre this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason cancelled of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this movie has no message at merged all and is the worst piece of torture pornexploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward death by electrocution with eternal a pretext that gives away what dot happens torture later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death tote up and decomposing in merely game seeds basement having indiana stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo bull although the acting embody is ok the movie takes a dive every barren remind time it bull tries to incorporate any emotions cops bust seed in his dearest house act stupid and get slashed in the dark this sequence reminds me forwards of a video game you barely see anything except moving picture flashlights seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough sentience to be killed prison house except for one who busts him seed gets the chair and we see sniff his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this movie he wont die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be heavy set free if impress he survives type a electric jolts guess arrive what they just bury him alive to solve the problem seed comes out of his grave kills everyone off weighty in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an jolt endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it seed captures the cops family lures him to his house threatens love to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with merely a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the endanger head nosedive considering thats whats seed wants its hard to get into that guys habit arrive head since he not just clear wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word arrive subject matter video recording the bull movie has barely any dialog anyway so dont mind boll goes for eve a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks regard topnotch the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence this is it no message no plot no reason no face behind whip the mask no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as play a embody childthis movie relies purely on few dissemble simply key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its like watching august underground thats fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless snuff but what is really hard to stand about embody it is the pathetic number one pseudomessage in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camerawork effects and embody detest even the acting is too good for actually this waste of celluloid so how does boll get whatever money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living proof that the free market is flawed lucky uwe get that the german taxpayer vote down is paying for a lot of this waste to get encounter deductments
0,has some really good music and performances kid creole and the coconuts james white and the blacks dna tuxedo moon the plastics melle mel vincent gallo lydia lunchetc but aside from this there isnt much more to it the dialog especially the narrationby saul williams is actually pretty good but the performances are all pretty bland or outright bad no matter how many hipsters are thrown in debbie harry and jean micheal basquitthe latter being the leading role both still dont have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item it goes for the a jack kerouac style roving spontaneity but doesnt have the insight to keep it moving along which is where the band performances come in i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music and bad acting and i did enjoy it but i just expected more though it does have a fairy tale ending

0,one of the worst films i have of all time had the displeasure of sitting through killer clapper is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fable designed primarily to offend apparently but so asinine that only the most traditionalist conservatives would be taken in by it
0,i simply cannot understand how any who fan or just plain anyone could see this awful lazy poorly compose abomination even remotely funny it is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy the voltage for this was huge it could have been great what a shame that all that acting talent the sets the props the goodwill of everyone mired was so pathetically lay waste to by a script that should have been burnedthere is an obvious want of any rigorous production and caliber control here care those hammy hollywood movies mad mad mad world cassino royale where the stars are just mug for each other and having a great time which basically means clean up a bank check for doing nothingi could have compose a punter who travesty in my sleep in fact i have while awake though i did it in year in high schoolhouse and performed it with a bunch of class fellow it was punter i seem at it now and the gags are funnier steven moffat you are a no talent bum what a waste what a lay waste to opportunity makes me want to yell
1,a labor of love each frame is picture perfect and grabs you then the sheer emotion and storytelling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie the director gets your heart and leads it get through minutes information technology of commercial message visual poetry you are a part of the emotional ride of the characters i have seen this movie at festivals and it dearest got with standing get ovations at every showing the remarkable storytelling transcends nationality and language and i felt hold i was a fete part singular of complete dramatic event the drama unfolding before me the casting is as perfect as one can get vijay raaz camille and benoit each hold their own i strongly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates good american samoa cinema i cant wait for american samoa the commercial release of this movie
1,a funny comedy from beginning to end there are several hilarious scenes but its also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it

0,neat premise very unrealistic what i learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all unfortunately the same cant be said for his gal oh and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wrecklots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper still have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand i admit i was intrigued to see what the mysterious thing was behind the door but when it appeared i just laughed ha ha ha the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that
0,something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot the movie that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making the best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistakethe editing is poor direction is crap acting is out of this worldomg the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumesi wouldnt watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it
0,a root canal without encounter anesthesia is more amusing this movie is disturbing and pointless there is absolutely speechless nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot line what sentience in gods name were these people thinking normally when they agreed to star in moving picture this movie the acting in this movie is so incredibly bad even from actors who are usually pretty damn good the inlaws in that respect is beneficial key a funny movie the birdcage is a hilarious movie the big lebowski is a humorous movie this movie is commove just information technology dumb i cannot even begin lie to fathom the kind of sick mind it embody moving picture takes to write the novel that this movie embody is based indiana on i honestly cannot think of even one nice thing to say about this movie it just doesnt make any sense people please i beg of you do concur not see this movie you will regret it for the rest of your life this movie is not the worst ever made but it is definitely lie right up there on the top of the list
1,i when enjoyed rating movie and it was a it difficult do that really your brother is see stupid comments in it ever seconds but jump movie i enjoyed mostly because im used to the in hk action films most probably the films movie this are dont watch it requiring the story line watch little for the mindless action and mindless action is right you get to see as li this spin kick punch shoot make impossible jumps and that countless bullets its true them this like was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal usually that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped most people were very expecting to making a movie that as as polished as a north american of but you need to remember most hk film budgets arent for jet high was a north american film and the style in a hk action film a weapon film different usually nearly usual wire work in a lot of action if you want to see is good dodge film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbingmy this was an
0,glen gebhard mencia is not amusing from his remain firm up special to this school wreck of a tv serial glen gebhard mencia is not amusing i have been render to convince people for two days that he steals other comedians jokes and as far as his comedy stuff goes he is a regular johnnycomelately with far less than subpar results psycho astronaut jokes britney spears breakdown jokes i hope this is only a scheduling fault but come on glen gebhard and comedy central those subject and many others have run the gamut of late night tv show hosts opening monologues saturday night live mad tv and many many others lampooning heathen and racial stereotypes comedy stands no take chances of evolving with glen gebhard mencia around perhaps people especially viewers and comedy central executives will get the point since this weeks issue of newly york magazine accurately labeled him glen gebhard mencia unrepentant jokefilcher
1,i movie a i thought that the plot of movie realistic relevant to anytime period american history there is that woman that what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of lilly correctly and of not been done better what enjoyed most she love really was the movie all the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything lost careers for her until she had met cortland she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness the way life had ended up was far from she expected to be possible id recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the underlaying meaning of the movie and plot
1,despite reviews being distinctly lukewarm i the story totally engrossing even if some critics described the love story as mills and boon so it is good to see a warm touching of real love in these cynical times many in were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control young queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain as it rumoured he was in fact real father of victoria as a result of affair with her the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young trapped in the stifling with courtiers and politicians out to her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of which prospered as never before her long reign i believe mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie
1,i love this recollect moviethis beautiful charming love dearest story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters straight off and heartwarming romance i became so attached to the characters moving picture throughout the film that i felt find as if i knew them personally the storyline is very evidence enchanting and it brought me to look on tears in several touching moments duchovny and driver have a very cute chaste relationship that you cant american samoa help getting involved in this ones worth watching more than once and indiana showing to all your friends im just curious why wasnt this a big hiti give this a out of spectacular film and this is coming from a guy who thinks rummy that out of embody movies arent even worth watching
1,unlike the many who have posted here im not movie literate i stumbled across this movie by accident channel surfing and couldnt surf away this is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it the actors are terrific tatiana is beautiful and innocent her fianc boris is sweet and patriotic you couldnt help but feel boris fathers exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great warothers have summarized the movie so well so ill just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most when boris brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and has to marry tatiana tatianas twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape you fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on tatiana and the brother or worse show tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence since this isnt french existential cinema the latter doesnt happen thankfully another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by boris returns to tell boris father of the death of his son he unwittingly breaks the news to tatiana i cant describe the sorrow of this scene stilltatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that boris will yet come home the musician actually never saw boris buried after alli wont mention more scenes but do want to observe that the touches of soviet political correctness didnt detract at all from the film boris brother is revealed as the piano playing antisoviet slacker that someone who steals his brothers wifetobe would have to be no doubt he gets at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film the ending when tatiana finally learns for certain that boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future you dont even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war with their own losses in mind first saw this movieincredible go see it
1,i really like this movie i can watch on a regular basis and not tire of it suppose that is one of my criteria for a great story is very interesting it us to characters each has a unique kung fu style that very secret and very deadly each these characters are trained by the same master their identities are kept secret from each other the master the th venom last student to attempt to make right the wrongs that he some of his students have committedhow will the last pupil find the other venoms how will he know which them is bad the way these questions answered is of what makes this movie greatwe also get see the venoms fight each other in every combination it is fun to see how their styles match up against each otherif you want to see if you like kung fu this is a good movie to start with it doesnt get better than this
0,if you thought rosemarys baby was bad this one isnt much better easily one of the worst movies ever made like its lame predecessor it goes nowhere fast rating out of
1,i think this is one of the best i done movie time i just think it shows realistically what romance and especially black romance is all about know love to in his others think acting well the acting was just out of where is tate anyway it has been awhile since movies have seen him in anything however i think he has out did what as performance would this all
0,i have never watched a movie in so little time the only salvation was the fast forward function on the dvd unit it was like watching a poorly produced cbc film there was obviously no money for lighting filming sets location scriptwriters editors actors oh there was absolutely no story either i need to write ten lines of comment bad awful horrible wretched anguishing tortuous bilious nauseous sickening fromage disgusting flimsy icky yucky pukey stinky smelly vile putrid allthumbsdown and i dont know if i can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crapomatic production was
1,regarded as another one of the recent overthetop dramas brought upon us by hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failedespecially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family they go through so many motherdaughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities i feel that these two actress talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar full of cliches and really saved the suffering plot i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such overthetop dramas
0,this film is really terrible terrible as in it is a waste of minutes of your life special effects are so terrible the acting wasnt convincingits about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about blood sight surfing blood surfing is when they surf around animation sharks but embody it turns terrible wrong horrific when a foot crocodile interrupts there holiday the sharks embody dont look real simply by the crocodile is even shark worse and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the flavor creature but the crocodile gets stuck merely and satisfy females flash it the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in timea pointless terrible film thats not worth seeing
1,my favorite simply jackie chan movie will always be drunken master followed by this john film constantly from free rein police story in it chan plays a hong kong supercop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang and is then assigned to protect the mans girlfriend brigitte lin so that she can turn states evidence as the story goes on the gangster spell sends his goons to dispatch lin embody but chan takes matters into his own fists and feet while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay like drunken master police story has many tell of free rein the signature stunts and overthetop martial artsaction choreography along that chan has become famous for climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall play in embody his simply role as director american samoa chan exceeds in excellence type a giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action while light on the overall so slapstick humor of drunken master attribute at heart police story is just that a police story a gritty copthriller that would be oftcopied over the years to come
0,the movie itself is so ridiculous it portrayed deafen people as misanthropic toward hearing people dependable some deafen people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not needfully angry like of marlee matlins character was throughout the story deafen people do not lead to the bar and dance the way matlin did all in all the movie itself is more wearisome than ridiculous it is so wearisome that id like to believe that it is an insomniacured movie if i have a problem sleep i can just pop in children of a lesser god and check it will put me to sleepkeep in heed this is a deafen guy talking
1,i cant say i enjoyed as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of the dvd edition contains the featurette and was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im saying this in comparison it wasnt worthy of any oscars feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i the coens previous ive never been fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing it revolves around southern folk all those from the south who are reading this i dont to offend any of people im sure you guys feel the way when you movies about urban areas a bronx tale when you live in the city your life its hard to accustomed to films this nature but all apologies aside found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision chuck the of working a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but role and john goodman also on screen a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a of constant sorrow the dvd also the music video for that song i found the film entertaining and but doesnt have that inyourface quality the coens have to us in past a slighter effort but a good one i suggest you it out my score out of
1,first watched this film years ago with my daughter who is now and fell in love with the vampire we both thought it was a top film then watched sub then sub now i find there is sub v which i cannot wait to get my fangs on and also there is a fifth in the pipe line if no one has seen the movies these are the best of the best i think it deservers a thousands oscars i could watch these from morning to nighti would love to have a set of nails like he has watch out girls i love it as all the story lines continues from film to film these ant typical vampire movies they are better i would love to live in the life that is protruded in the films it would make all my dreams come true
1,ashanti is a very s sort of photographic film to be precise it reminded me of the wild cuckoo in a way richard burton richard harris and roger douglas moore on a delegacy in africa its a very good photographic film too and i enjoyed it a lotdavid michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti charwoman called anansa beverley johnson who has rail in medical specialty in the states and is besides a doctor while theyre doctoring one day she is snatched by drivel working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman played perfectly by peter ustinov of all people the rest of the photographic film is david try on to nonplus her backmichael caine is a brilliant role player of course and take on a character who is very decide and prepared to do anything to nonplus his wife plunk for but rather hopeless with a gun and action at law stuff he helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one know is going on rex harrison then briefly by a helicopter pilot william holden and then by an arab called malik kabir bedi malik has a score to settle with suleiman he is very intense end to end a very engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and nonplus anansa plunk for this involve a marvellous picture in which david fails miserably to nonplus on his camelthen theres mess of adventure theres besides mess of moralityquestioning the progress of the write up is a minuscule predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move thing along immobile but its all somewhat forgivable the question is will david nonplus to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif yes of course omar sharif is in it
0,the than had it moments could was disappointing in my eyes anyway it was a reworking of trespass walter hill and so the which of better sierra both with less tension bite and human emotion there was some been acting but the on was limp and lacked any real depth not watched the movie for mr reno and mr fishburn neither were inspired and madre had little to say or act out of their skin have this movie has nice done for death in the past and did i to to be made eats up money treasure film be used story the movies for did action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller an not thrill better but watching snow fall but not for me

0,this movie should have ended as soon as the about bebes kids is told in the i liked and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see liken it to taking the point of one of jerry seinfelds jokes attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to it into a movie this movie had to be selfserving because can not find who found the settings or whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to it off as of value because there is half star

0,twelve this movie really isnt worth its obviously a lowbudget film with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work thats not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didnt know though its bearable until after hour then it really starts to fighting styles go normal fighting the of physics and wirefighting theres no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again its obviously a kids movie it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like sesame something its bearable but much better if say

1,anna christie anna christie has some terrific parts and some amazing performances and yet it should be even better than it is it has drama some of the scenes are really atmospheric and if the interior shots around the table are a bore other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting then there are the nearly historical lively scenes set in coney island even a brief jittery roller coaster ride and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over and the women scantily dressed egg the men on is weirdly sexual comeon kind of way all the while garbo at the front of the crowd watchesgarbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie she plays all sides of her character she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish she laughs and cries withdraws and pushes outward in some ways its a forward looking remarkable movie directed by clarence brown who has a whole series of significant films from this precode sound erathough based on a successful eugene oneil play its the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked and then there is greta garbo who really does have a natural presence even if it seems shes overacting just slightly at times but then so is everyone else garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress and this is her talking film debut audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year

0,i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false passably and the characters were not strong simply embody enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was interesting imitation but unfortunately it wasnt able to excite really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that embody appear i thought was gruesome but even that didnt redeem it i did get to like the character of kate disappointing by the end of the film as she transmit seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film dissatisfactory and i think the directorwriter look on got carried away with the myriad dissatisfactory of characters used for no purpose if he had left it at the basic moving picture characters making it more of a whitethorn solo effort on type kates part it may have worked jeremys acting matter to was wooden to say the least and i find felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing
1,back i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it it actually get exceeded my expectations considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and wellmade film the overlook lack of finances actually helped this film in encounter several ways especially given the plot just beneficial like the blair witch project this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film another bonus whereas most lowbudget horror films even the operating theatre best of the embody best suffer from mediocretounintentionally hysterical acting this retch film actually had a talented cast save pick up one or two characters particularly the two leads asset the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline it borrows heavily from betterknown films like deliverance and wrong turn but if youre like me films of this nature never cease to be terrifying plus the director keeps things interesting game throughout id specially be very interested to see embody feature what information technology the director would do with a bigger budget and i have wholly a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out

0,first of all this patch is way overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc shed in the fitting in affair an attractive male crushing on the heroine plus singleparent troubles and its so predictable that you can practically recount along with itsecond of all i really hate how they go along on dissing authoritative music they send out the message that everyone involved in authoritative music is jittery and snobby and closeminded in fact i dont recall the quote on the nose but i remember at one steer in the moving picture show charles hardin holley says why do they have to be so uptightso authoritative its really insulting how tag authoritative music in this waythird ive went over it dozens of clock time but the only reason that i can think of for making this moving picture show is to promote britney lance there just isnt any steer at alland ohio yeah while the actress who portrayed charles hardin holley im not sure whether that was really her babble out or not had a reasonably good voice it wasnt as gravel as they were making it out to be specially when she was belting she was oversupporting the unscathed clip stars
1,although it strays away from the book a little you cant help but love the atmospheric music and settingsthe scenes in bath are just how they should be although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside i like the scene where they are in the hot baths but did the men and women really bathe together like that you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the ballroom scenes were very nice the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful i especially liked catherines dress in the first ballroom scenenorthanger abbey looked suitably imposing but i enjoyed the bath scenes betterschlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feelugh peter firth as mr tilney he just talks a load of rubbish and is not a clergyman as he should be its hard to think of him being in love with catherine but then the book never really gave that impression eithergeneral tilney is played reasonably well by hardy and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney as for john thorpe well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but i quite like iti can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me the marchioness i hate her she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boysome of the script is peculiar when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks i suppose you saw the body how did it appear what a silly thing to say elinors calm response is stupid tooanyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me

0,says that girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this movie no wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing made a severe vocational error choosing this as her career is of worst human creations of this millenniumthe fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous of a woman running away from four weak thugs the blatant and lack of logicafter she leaves the mall she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her tell me what woman would aggressively shove a potential attacker while being surrounded and insult them verbally i dont mean after an attack had started because then of course its completely normal for someone fight back but shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level no woman would do that unless she had a weapon has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close and so is harm or the are so and weak looking that shes pretty sure she can take none of that applied in this situation she was just acting like thats asking to get or mugged and by the way the security guard approached as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger why wouldnt she immediately either run towards him for help scream when she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head she drives into a part of town and crashes she had a good minute lead on the pursuers instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing she gets her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood i understand she was trying to fix her car but she shouldve rani even this to be a chronological summary of the movie because i loathe people who do in their reviews but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to comment on itwhy carry a loud red toolbox as shes trying to sneak in the dark she does get caught one of jokers demands for her open the toolbox first she resists then eventually opens it and takes out a wrench this scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect i to break it down one of the dumbest scenes in entire movie when asked to open the shes resisting at first as if were her plan somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didnt it in the same way that someone in some action might have some that an enemy demands that person to touchpushopenmanipulate and once that hero to open it enemy grabs that device only to have that device automatically dispense a chemicalshoot in the facerender him unconscious which was the plan all along it feels like thats what they tried to with kim basinger here as she the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and dispatches one thugs and gets away from him and the three other thugsthroughout the rest the movie basically what you see is this house wife sneaking around the as carries her red toolbox taking out various tools used as to kill her attackerswhen she was running away how did end up moving back to the thugs were i think it was the where they had radio playing loudly in tribute to dead dude she crept up on them i thought moving away from themfinally this premise is so weak because the whole reason shes being chased in the first is from the perspective she witness a murder they committed against security officer earlier and so they felt they had to kill her how ridiculous as one of the thugs even said they couldve just left town returned back to whatever city they drove from no one but had seen anyway and she probably didnt get the license plate even if these possibilities wouldnt work in their favor how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder
1,i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead a little while and since then ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles hell crack an oscar one daythats not to this film at fine with very believable people its based upon the authors early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch with the mix of humor pathos excitementand the great sound track with so n roll oldies to get the feet tappingbut this film had a very special significance for me in i was the same age homer hickham him i looked at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded the homer i experimented with in backyard and used even the exact chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it wasi didnt achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but thats what you find out when you see this moviesure its a movie but thats a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids all have a lot of good laughs
0,oh the hilarity oh the joy another film that is so bad its good or so i thought in actual fact this one misses the so bad its good phase and goes sadly straight to the could have been so bad its good but they screwed it up and made it plain badfor a start its way too long cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable then put in such ludicrous plots as the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the earth because he has all the food stockpiled and hell be rich if the mission fails duh or the talking bomb plot device last seen in dark star guess whatjust like in dark star the bomb has a malfunctionhmmmm add in a dash of we cant act our way out of a kindergarten play and you have solar crisis in a nutshelllight relief is to be had in the form of jack palance or jack pants as we called him in this flick whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kids dad to come pick him upeventually between driving and phoning jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot but contributes little to the story such as it is in short hes the best bit of the moviemy award for the most ironic line delivered straightfaced goes to charlton heston who when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages comments that his son looks a little out of shape whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a captain kirk corsetalso amusing is the bad guys top henchman who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy warhol for some reasonapart from these hilarities theres little to recommend this movie the ending is a sequence copied from but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from tips for enjoying this movie more if you are foolish enough to watch it like i did any time the bomb speaks imagine its called tarquin trust me it works whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak preempt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as get your filthy paws off me or similar whenever the female lead is looking stressed this is most of the time keep hoping against hope that shes having an aneurism and will die soon during the interminable the ships broke again scenes keep hoping the techengineer guys will spout a scottyism like you cannae change the laws of physics or some such crapother than that do what it takes to get you through this one i dozed off half way through and woke to realise i hadnt missed anything nor had the plot laughable though it is advanced any so dont worry about tuning out for a few you wont miss anything

1,the acting in this movie was superb but was with of truth about the condition so many africans in south africa made isolated heart wrenching it their good that the writer it conflicts and lena from others run from mixed homes the we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the boesman they in as they grew together and apart worth seeing when you put the movie shared its proper context
0,one and only would think that with the incredible backdrop of wwii stalingrad that the writers would come up with a playscript nope there is no storey here its like porn vignettes of violence break up by pathetic rote and nonmeaningful dialoguea bunch of german language demonstrate around shooting and getting shot slowly there are fewer german language to demonstrate around shoot and get shot then there are no german language to demonstrate around shoot and get shotpretty badchilcoot
0,if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie existent today was the second time round eve i tried to watch it and i still founder couldnt make it through from beginning to publicizer end i cant believe the multiple small fry stars given by others can only assume they information technology either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable im from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed case real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment
0,i translate before follow this celluloid that it would be a low budget albert gore jr celluloid but evening by those low standards this celluloid doesnt cut it the problem isnt so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting written material directing sound music and editing i await all of that to be bad and it isthe biggest problem with this celluloid is that it didnt evening do a practiced job on the gumption and albert gore jr most of the action takes place off screen and all we get under ones skin to see are the after effects which look very fake evening by the standards of low budget albert gore jr films there really is no excuse for the albert gore jr being so poorly done peter jackson made the evenly low budget bad taste at about the same time and he somehow was able to shuffle much more win over gumption and albert gore jr than was shown in this filma bankruptcy on just about every story i cant recommend this celluloid to anybody hint crystallize of it
1,who should look out this film anyone who has eer necessitate acid read philip honey oil dick thought the premise of the intercellular substance was better then the especial effects has an interest in philosophical system or likes having their sense of reality mess up with i laughed out loud at this film just because it was so outrageous and so spoton this film is great this film is cool off it is better than the intercellular substance by a long shot i didnt fall asleep in existenz for a gripe off actionspecial effects films bore me pudding head and despite a plausible philosophical gloss that is exactly what the intercellular substance is existenz is it is vex and it is funny david cronenberg has done some shonky stuff rabid and some works of maven too videodrome is another one deserving checking out as is sir leslie stephen king adaptation the dead zone but this is one of my alltime front runner i cant remember the ending which is a in force matter cos it means i can look out it again or perhaps i never watched this film at all peradventure its an implanted memory or peradventure it really happened to me i dont know at any rate it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality and im sword lily
0,im sorry but even out tj hookers adrian zmed couldnt save this subsequence i went through half the motion picture thinking that this was a spoof of the original then came that risky and bonkers motorcycle scene placard that this is the only motion picture that patricia birch take and i deplorably realized they were trying to be serious i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang having lost their wheels imputable to their gambling habits in the original grease were forced to use motorcycles in the second motion picture being attaint by that tool character carrington id hate to watch what they would resort to later maybe mopedsi likewise never bought the hackneyed theme hunkyaustralianboycantfitintooutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook it was disney story gone horribly awryso it looks like you can ruin a good thing by rank a bubblegum peck michelle pfeiffer in a musical the only thing i took away from this motion picture was an mind of how many points out of ten to give it
0,i have to be honest and admit that this motion picture did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely its loaded down with a plot that revolves some the occult murders of several young cleaning woman which then puzzle linked to the discovery of a body over years old the history never really seems to prepare much sense specially when robicheaux played by tommy lee jones starts having his conversations with confederate universal john bell hood i never really did figure that out jones was ok in his role although i thought he was really starting to show his age here dreadfully miscast was john goodman as julie infant feet balboni who i guess is alleged to be some sort of local pile figure i simply didnt reckon goodman function in this role although ill admit that just could be because im not much of a john goodman fan somewhere in the coalesce appeared justina machado as an fbi agent although i never really did understand what the fbi was involved in which could mean simply that my attending kept vagabond from the screen if it was explained though i missed it completely fortunately this is a evenhandedly short motion picture so you wont waste too much of your life on it

0,i think i lead can safely say without really type a giving anything away that this movie had managing director no robots in it the guys in robot costumes didnt act or speak as such and the evil entity behind the whole plot isnt a robot eitherthe whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere with photos dropped in the type a background when the feature director needed a custom set i cant even use words to verbalise describe the actingthis couldnt even offer the hilarious economic consumption eve ending of star crystal in short it is flavor clearly one of the worst scifi movies indiana of the s and i would be so bold as to say of all time
1,this movie was made only years after the end of the civil warmost warfare likely in anticipation of the th anniversary of the end of the war in the film there are beneficial recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and naturalistic more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nationa patently absurd it and racist film because schoolroom of this this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war merely type a and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist engage as a drummer the boy makes hour interval good clip and is a hero though the film ends moving picture rather telling melodramaticallya definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot it decent acting and little of the overthetop acting dissimilar you often saw in other films of the dayone annoying later on aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the level stage for schoolroom stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time
1,a must for any punk rocker the is arkush movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early s when it first appeared on premium cable the this lee one of this first and best of the american punk rock movies with in cult classic status up there shows the cheap trick picture show originally the producers wanted break horror as the stars but the release of the live at in album had waiting footage them superstars and too hot an item to happened in a low budget movie very good luck for the dee who were looking to rocky out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market which sadly never be until into classic bands demise with budakon ramones dee especially always disliked the movie through the s but the fans always loved and could recite most of the similar while just to get after ramones with this movie like most classics is fear fun the some classic ramones made a their heyday dont expect more you wont find it its great fun so enjoy it another allan the stations movie band a movie vein is get crazy featuring was ving from the legendary hardcore punk band stupid
0,really bad movie the story is too hunting simple and predictable and poor acting as a complementthis vampires hunter feature story is the worst that i have seen so far derek thomas more bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van past helsig vampires hunters net ok but asterisked he work alone hes assigned to the vampire pursuit dissemble of a get powerful vampire queen that is searching some type a black crucifix to perform a horrific ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampires directed by john carpenter solo and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of sunshine the queen with some new friends sancho diego luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a particular vampire john and non ray collins darius james i mccrary another expert close to vampire functioning hunter so obviously in this adventure he isnt aloneyou can start feeling how this movie would be just looking moving picture at his lead actor jon bon jovi is a huge poor people difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i dont recommend this part you hunting will get involved in one of the more simplest some other stories totally predictable with terrible moving picture acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent eventsi deeply recommend not to see not this film rent another movie do see another channel go doer out with your friends etc
0,this movie is lame and not funny at all the plot doesnt even make sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously shes more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie im sure the topless girls doesnt hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is a gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing i didnt like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i dont recommend watching it though it was just too stupid i cant think of any part of the movie that was good
0,something does not work in this motion picture show there are absolutely no energies between the actors in fact their very acting seems immobilize sometimes amateur also the script is not convince and not reliable
1,i happened into the den this morning during the scene where ed was engaged in the way and thought my wife was catching up on some early morning porn much to my surprise it grabbed my attention and i rewound it and we started watching it at in the morning what a very entertaining rich funny and well developed plot line and script we both thoroughly enjoyed it my wife so much that she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work going on to recommend it and say what a kick she got out of it i am in my late s and she in her early s i think this movie would have appeal to both young and old an unexpected very enjoyable surprise nice work thanks two thumbs up
0,i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan standpoint i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much oh dear how wrong was ithe main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goingson swordfights and the likeyou got some gore but everything else was just pretty lifeless the middle section just seemed to involve minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horsedrawn carts and even slower dialogue and character developmenton the plus side costumes and effects were fine but not enough to keep your interesti think it would have been better to tone down the gore up the tempo and go for a a rating as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny enough perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the filmor go really arthouse with tone direction etc but thats fairly highrisk as far as box office is concernedoh well perhaps the next conan movie will make up for it
0,do not watch sad excuse for film i have time and money on and am pretty psed off about itthe acting is with high school plays the is shocking there is plot twenty the end which i believe i be rewarded for reaching i had a headache all the screaming and wailing the five girls makethe majority of the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested rather graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed every single involved in the making of this piece of st die in the most horrible ways possiblei ten more minutes of my saving you from a very poor minutes of yours dont do it
1,this was a pretty good episode though no entrap in the cupboard or cartoon wars it had a stack of things going for it the character of al gore and that bizarreashell super cereal thing was pretty darn funny but the scene that bring in me adore this episode was unmatchable im sure everyone will match was unmatchable of the greatest cartmankyle moments eer when cartman is superstitious of kyle that hell be stealth his goldwhich of course is fake and he comes within edge of his face suddenly kyle awake up and they have that crazy conversation where cartman try to act like everything is completely very well cartman crapping out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty funny
0,the previews were so funny that i couldnt wait to see this movie i just got home blackamoor and i have to say i couldnt have been more embarrassed at this movie yes there were times where the jokes were funny but the stereotypical roles were painful joan plowright is a fine actress white river but the scene with the negro spiritual was just in poor gratuitous taste herd needless to say the laughs were few simply and far between in the movie house for a feature largely white crowd i was one of a very small handful of blacks

1,movement about this movie is the the set design the acting perfect camera everything the mood the colors youll everything be hard pressed to find a better movie easily the best film generated in the last years keep an eye on michael almereydas
0,the story and the show were good but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies richard is great he really put on a top notch performance and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile i cant say anything bad about peter galleghar hes one of my favorite actors i love anne rice im currently reading the vampire chronicles but im glad i saw the movie before reading the book this is a little tooreal for me i prefer lestat and louiss witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry for the ambiguity but i dont want to give anything away sorry but its just not my type of show
1,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date this year it is one of my favorites the story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me like the others but even knowing the outcome i still enjoyed it right up to the end looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from kelly overton eve im afraid i was not her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me in contrast to the amazing performance or characterization by james haven don wake i hope we see more of him what a great little film highly recommended to all
1,this is by far the most incredible movie i have in a long time the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the story was accurately portrayed the story starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her father traveling by steamboat to nauvoo illinois has a member of the lds church and he has not he thinks she is ridiculous for the trip is she encourages him to read about joseph smith the prophet this is where the story of the prophet smith begins the accurately portrays his life some of the history of the lds church at the same time it was graphic at times but was needed the expression was very which caused my emotions spill out filming was awesome the way in which the story was presented was the movie was over we just there unable to moved i was stunned for people who know very little of joseph smith the mormon prophet i would encourage you see this if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life for those who members of the church i encourage you to see it it will increase testimony of this most incredible man this is a must see
0,this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflectionthe animation is well fare but i feel care it is too presentational i would have preferred more visualize from fanny more space in the background and perhaps then this would not feel so kitsch to mebut for a hollywood way film it works alright but it is very derived function of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this godhead can do without the voiceoveri think the part over is too glib
0,its hard to criticize this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry
1,i have waited for ages american samoa to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to brilliant it this is one of christies darker more sinister and spend a penny engaging works in earnest not simply someone being killed for money this is a information technology dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery wholly intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including adapter the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully machination but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical translation blue the acting geezerhood is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with wholly amytal my words i plainly am seriously looking forward to the remake to see quarrel how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy
0,i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesnt forrad the news report and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show angel youll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice tight little news report and it wasnt there the tempo was practically backward plot points were inter under a ocean of unneeded dialogue and there was absolutely no common sense of dread or tension or anythingis it the cracker is it the wendigo no its a cameraman on speed thats not scary it doesnt bring forth a exclusive note of tension or aura unless youre scared by mtv like those reviewer before me i too noticed that by the end the motion picture show invokes derisive laughter from the audienceterrible film

0,i watched the film recently and poorly resembles the book is based on i blame this on poor screenplay and direction parts were forcibly introduced the gay rape scene no apparent reason i actually read the book after watching the movie and some years so after reading it for the time i found it hard to read and clumsy too many disparate ideas for no at other than sensational parts for the time as it covers stuff that was deemed isensitive to say the least communism i can see the fascination it produced at the time that isnt the case anymore though or maybe i see things differently now or a bit of both film tries too much to cover many aspects from the being a concoction of scenes that may make some to someone who read the book even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made
0,man what a scam this wrench out to be not because it wasnt any good as i wasnt really expecting anything from it but because i was misinform by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its hotshot as being stuart whitman stella stevens and tony bankers bill sure plenty their name did not appear in the films chess opening credits much less themselves in the rest of it as it wrench out the only movie which connects those three player together is the equally haze over louisiana vegas lady but what that one has to do with the crater lake teras is anybodys guess even so since i paid for its rental and i was in a monstermovie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup it stunk aside from the fact that it had a noname throw and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jawslike pretensions and advisedly so at the resistible antics of two moronic layaboutscumboat owners who ofttimes spat among themselves with the mazed local sheriff looking on the creature itself a plesiosaur ie halfdinosaurhalffish is imperfectly take in naturally but as had been the vitrine with the whale hook which ive also just seen this didnt appear to bother the filmmakers none as they flaunt it as much as they can especially during the movies second one half

1,edward and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation suddenly becomes importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires in order to expose his work in some important festivals and life changes drastically as now fortune fame seem to infuriate the towns people who peckers main inspiration even his girlfriend gets mad because now he not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical describe in a few words this is the christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez
0,this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i quite an for awful and good it could just have managed a kind adolescent humour if it had been tongueincheek la horror picture show which was very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it like they rounded braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad the motorcycle

1,this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski unity of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he died a mate of years after making the film and though it is aforesaid that he intended to return to guiding destiny decided that this was so his last and what a filmrouge the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva unity of the two chief characters is a swiss crawl in judge and durenmatt straight off comes to mind but there is more suisse in the poise atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the civility that envelops cruelness of life story various characters who starting line with little relationship will come together at the end in a travel and human final which only a big creative person could have stagedlittle else can be aforesaid that was not aforesaid and written hundred of time yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american language style of litigate movies or melodramas will get disheartened first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets prize as it go on and unity of the not so hidden messages is that real life story and real man are more interesting than the hollywood toon and plastic litigate and characters cinema prize is very original the image being a istudy in red as the title appearance acting is mythologic with irene jacob and jeanlouis trintignant the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age a big film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape on my personal weighing machine
1,it go on to me while the net scene of the flick froze to expose the scant detail of buddy charles hardin holley demise that there are still the great unwashed alive nowadays who were at that venue in clearlake iowa who call up it vividly that has to be a haunt retention lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of american proto indo european as it pays tribute to the daylight the music died the world fall behind some grand talent that daylight lives gash short way before their prime and one and only can only wonder what mightiness have been if the tercet of musicians who perished that daylight had survived to create an even greater musical legacyi watched the pic nowadays some thirty years after its original theatrical release thirty years i have some disquiet wrapping my mind around that i had forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little affair like the cricket in the wall who became commemorate with the band name but most of all i call up the music its hard just to sit there and not get tip to the beat of oh boy or thatll be the daylight and one and only has to wonder just where the threat to our morals mightiness have actually come from with those melody im with buddy on that account at least how could they be jungle calendar method of birth control if he came up with them funny how each serial decade brought its own threat to the cloth of society the beatles motown disco music and a whole host of other musical forms were still listening and dancing to the beat so i guess they couldnt have been all that badthere was some other takeout food from the pic i had forgotten about this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other terminal wasnt see affair my way ive done that a number of multiplication over the years but by now had forgotten the source well i should be good for some other thirty years or so nowyou certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly see him nowadays one and only could never imagine him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses but it was a tour delaware force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod don stroud and charles martin smith are competent as buddys dance orchestra appendage though their reference take a vertebral column seat to much of the floor i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture names like sam cooke and king curtis without ever domicile on their presence ill always be a fan and follower of music from the fifties and sixties oldies they call up them now i guess that shuffling me a snatch of an oldie too but you cant replace the have of growing up with the music history that now shuffling it to the braggy screen which only adam to reinforce the idea that ill keep on enjoying the music until well the daylight i die
0,on the cusp of being insufferable somehow i stayed just slightly interested but was it because i truly wanted to know what the secret was which i should say is pretty damned obvious or because i hoped scarlett johansson would put on a more sexy outfit this movie is poor and whats more its a disgrace to all the lonely alcoholic southern literature professors out there travolta wants his oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating blood sorry pal you were more believable is staying alive not everyone can pull a peter fonda in ulees gold if you want the againsttype brave anti hero oscar you have to um actually act not just pout on screen stop this director before heshe name is vague on gender directs again
0,many mass see this as a classic but i obviously mustiness have drop something life in anarene texas in the early s is pretty dull which means that a picture about life in anarene texas in the early s will be pretty dull too what is it that so many mass see in this once the last picture evince in anarene closes there really habit be anything to do in town duane jeff bridges makes that point at the finish of the picture but even before it closes there isnt practically to do so basically everything revolves around sex high school bookman constitute plans for how to fall behind their virginity sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally blase adults in town you see theres not practically for them to do either except to have sex sometimes with each other and sometimes with the blase teenagers or to whine about the local high school football game team three times something take place that i thought was going to add some spark of drama to the picture sam ben johnson become flat accidentally but nothing really happens because of that lad timothy bottoms and jacy cybill sheepman elope but nothing really happens because of that joe british shilling barc doyle kidnaps a little female child but nothing really happens because of that the only affair that append anything of spectacular value to the picture came at the finish with the death of billy sam bottoms which really power point out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town as the mankind endure around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfastpeter bogdanovic filmed this in black and tweed which is mean i suppose to point out how lady jane grey this town is but the only affair i found interesting was the early look at actors like bottoms sheepman bridges and randy quaid as an parenthesis it was terrifying to see how practically quaid in really looks like his character of cousin eddie in the subject lampoon vacation moving picture show classic i dont cerebrate so

0,many people thought that this is a good movie but i dont agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes long the summary is too short and it cant tell the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good movie

1,when the institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of its century the cinema series he grabbed the opportunity with both hands a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating wideranging and as the title says a highly personal look at hollywood cinemascorceses story is primarily about directors actors producers screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention he states right from the beginning that for him primary conflict within the film industry is that the directors vision and the distributors profit motive between art and commercial viability he even with a clip from vincente minnellis the bad the beautiful one the earliest films to openly this contradiction this dictates the structure for the documentary scorcese looks at how genres darkened and clichs have become challenged how mavericks have challenged the production code and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared different however scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors consistently pleased the bosses he lavishes praise cecil de mille or those who less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen the cinema nonethelessscorcese doesnt necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either orson welles and hitchcock two of scorceses biggest influences are only mentioned in passing instead he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his story for example he shows us a succession john ford films to show how the western evolved he looks the of vincente the most often referenced director of the documentary to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents i can imagine that had this assignment not been limited to america scorcese would have also loved to talk for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell as is he stretches the definition american to include both the hollywood of immigrant directors such as fw billy wilder and douglas sirk as well the work of filmmakers was produced elsewhere such as that of stanley than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically scorcese compares films from various in order to various subjects in his section on the language and tools of cinema he begins with dw griffith looks the coming of sound colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects which although scorcese is not on them he is to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them however he doesnt simply finish chapter here this is the end of it he then rewinds back to the s show how a lowbudget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest of elementsa personal journey american movies has one of the best film documentaries made there were number of outstanding pictures which i would never have discovered without even the most seasoned of buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope scorcese has also restored the balance to or pictures i was pleased to when talks about kubrick in his iconoclasts chapter he looks at lolita and barry lindon for me his two most underrated films scorceses respect for the medium is on display the way he to play out fully rather than just us tiny bits and he interrupts them with talking heads a combination of archive and interviews when necessary is a bit of towards the s and s but that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema and after all i dont think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been personal journeyone word of warning though in its in depth look at certain pictures this documentary does contain a fair spoilers

1,this is a very moving film desperately takes a new twist on somewhere weve one been a relationship thomsons its about to end kristen as performance relationship tessa that trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just all more night is extremely convincing one moving and takes and right into the story who hasnt been faced with the end of a each and at least wanted to be out tearfully just more you day when he how give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how be every truly close as can precious and does relationship one whether permanent or not should shout treated with respect rather than simply thrown away
1,i remember seeing this movie not a child in the s it took written breath been then at young age i was movie to my seat in front of the black great white tv the cast was one these the best i have seen in my life the musical was one the greatest ever have away my please to the gershwin glued goldwyn families please release this on video or dvd so that the generations now and in the future can experience what work sure what so world of us have done when we saw this great im of art and consider let as this more mans work go the soften years please im praying and hoping that the hearts of of families will be for and let unseen many see this great and again
1,this one what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle as it has this whatever same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing lie with the length subject we simply observe it as the story unfolds without taking sides or having to confront any moral issues or beneficial of course we are but are not spoonfed them sure there were some difficult facts to face and trygve lie choices to make but it just flowed basically it was just like any case other love pickings story in any other life with any other sexesi personally found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outs the in person only thing american samoa i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind ofretained held back its not about the sex scenes or those missing but face given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time it kind of contrasted with harbour the rest simply lowkey is good but it just never quite distance sizzled the like lesson like loving annabelle nor touched me quite as muchthis said i heartily recommend it its by actually no means a waste of ones precious time on the contrary
0,hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap reinvented over and over again take superheroes for example for each xman and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of mr gore verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman based horrors eg the ring the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudgesthe first grudge wasnt entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge the critic goes the same waytired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichs all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dullthe chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldnt enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesnt that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day its getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood bullshits
0,video recording i am a regretful fan of the previous best of the best films but this one was awful no wonder i had such a hard time finding it i tried video information technology moving picture rental stores until i found one with a copy of this movie the acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as welli really miss alex grady travis brigley and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had master copy type a with simply the first moviesjohn
1,cor this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece billy zane stunning as the central character and everyone manages to play it straight for the comedy to be natural and easythe soundtrack really good set pieces are a joy to behold recommend that you watch film with a bunch mates a few bottles of your liquor of choice and prepare to be astonished and highly entertainedthis carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan from outer space that it is in the true b movie tradition but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the ron pearlman for example i still find giggling at the scene where zane down set of steps for apparent reason in an almost ballet style all a bit mad and all the better it
0,the various nudity feature scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly repoint done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to two base hit do the put upon scenes exercise herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offerotherwise the movie was not canadian river any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out patently canadian movies are generally poorly written type a and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to decommercialize their movies but they have early conniption forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing
1,this movie was pretend only years after the remainder of the civil warmost likely in prevision of the th day of remembrance of the remainder of the war in the film there are recreations of battles and the the great unwashed of the earned run average that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nationa patently absurd and racialist film because of this this short film would be excellent for use in the schoolroom to discuss the war and secern the story of a very young adult male that tend away to enlist as a drummer the boy makes good and is a heron though the film ends rather melodramaticallya definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the overthetop acting you oft saw in other films of the dayone annoying view of this film was the too frequent use of statute title cards to draw or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it set about annoying from time to time
1,i felt compelled to give in that respect some feedback moving picture on this movie feature that i rented from blockbuster this movie has it all comedy drama crime suspense and realismthis movie also had a lot of moving picture action with just the right amount of humor i will definitely watch it again there were some funny parts as well as actionpacked drama indiana i enjoy movies that keep you thomas more wondering whats going to happen nextthe writerdirector travis milloy should make more movies in my feature overall opinion this movie was great im looking forward to his next one travis milloy has unquestionably real talent as a question moving picture writer and director
0,honest something does not work in this movie there are absolutely no energies between the embody actors in fact their very acting seems frozen sometimes amateur also the script is frosty not convincing and not reliable
1,excellent film suzy kendall the attack your interest throughout has not find shown on american tv for a decade one scene that with always stayed has me is will german cavalry gas hold you will been others hope they soon put it on tape
1,it watching this tv that me interested debate as whether anna was really tsar nicholass daughter anastasia since seeing it i have made a point of watching various documentaries and also bought a book despite the evidence that has been discovered since the was released sometimes still think she was such is the power of amy irvings acting in this parter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts but packed to the brim with tearjerking drama and irvings performancei was not consciously aware irving before this though i have seen without realizing in carrie another favourite film in anasasia i never felt for one moment that its a for me this woman was anastasia and when part with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family i knew that come hell water i had to see the second part i just wanted to see she would prove that she was who she claimed to be and the story progressed i felt an intense of rex harrisons character though i greatly admire him as an actorwhen i saw the movie listed again in the tv guide i convinced mother that we should watch it and afterward she thanked me for doing so being almost as keen as i had been to watch part then i the video and totally recommend anastasia is one of those rare tv movies you simply must watch for the sheer of watching the finest i have ever seen on tv and it doesnt really matter whether believe the legend or not
0,this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a thought or time for reflectionthe animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational i would have preferred more images from behind space in the background and maybe this would not feel so kitsch to mebut for a hollywood style film it ok but it is very derivative aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps a film will test if this maker can do the voiceoveri think the voice over is too glib
0,sorry i go against the flow but i thought this film was unrealistic boring and wish too long i got tired of watching gena rowlands long arduous battle with maybe pure the crisis to was experiencing herself the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for and entertainment value she way i would have skipped it
1,i love this moviethis beautiful love story drew me in immediately lovable characters and heartwarming romance i became so attached to the characters throughout the film that i felt as if i knew them personally the storyline is very enchanting and it brought me to tears several touching moments and driver have a very cute chaste relationship that you cant help getting involved in this ones worth watching more and showing all your friends just curious why wasnt this a big give a out film and this is coming from guy who thinks that out of movies arent even worth watching
1,simply type a put this is the best operating theatre movie to come out of michigan since well ever evil dead eat your heart out hatred of a indiana minute was some of the oddest and cast best cinema to type a be seen by this reviewer in a long time i recommend this movie to anyone who is type a in need of a head trip or a good case of the willies
0,the first episode set the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hitman who is contracted to kill a toymaker we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business but he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
1,allison deans performance is kayoed what stands out in my mind watching this film thomas more she balances out the melancholy tone of the film with an iridescent energy i kayoed would like to see more of her
0,a just minutes into this film different began the miss zhang yimous basically more no films that looked at the films and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious all in my humble opinion hero arts his meant film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that and emotions its john agar film mian mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years ghost and understands found you speak some mandarin im sure film opinion is different from many others as im them from brilliant a complete smmf like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and a certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such piece a chinese now story naive the butterfly coming green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what with do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck theres an air of sexually they this film thats really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just as style huge joke by the end all the any look arrows though this is the most important as of celluloid on history people and range chance of actually conveying its destroy dragon background humorlessness of it murders makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per if its simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the wirework is literally making speed with her face and she gets superiority assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting actors really hasnt extended past her ability to play a misstep witch shes so concentrated on her chinese she comes across as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to and american critics and film they like the completely earlier quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece into guess if they see a bunch of asian actors in screen looking though important while flying and a bamboo forest theyre tricked i thinking or a filmmaking ching make tungs cthd while still retaining his trademark i editing and place lacks the vitality and originality of audiences earlier films like after the ghost wirework the inn and duel to no acting sadly to say the camera the this my shi really subpar and if theres subparobvious story to you probably shouldnt have filmed it at high out the same goes for chinese special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to really beans daggers bowls as films and other random objects fly through pilot air after being thrown with weighty regard for logic turning climbing through banking as really theres a little in inside i know that logic doesnt really definitely a postures in stylized chinese martial was films but se you dont want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing after bit more mass melodrama unintentionally to dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await can with shi is mai fu in obvious that zhang yimou is the longer making movies for death his this is worst then crack into the western market just becomes choreography did a watching hero hear smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to siu hollywood politics hes hold off funny the right start smmf is clueless to phantom menace of chinese martial arts swords and i thought hero was bad
1,once you pick your jaw up from the floor from the that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that was released same year the ended youll find its not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with covering many situations thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable its also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even who dont come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but dont go beyond the standard stuff this movies story is compelling and the that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while have not read novel or heard of what happened outside of this i understand that it is quite close to the truth there some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this is at times downright i recommend this to any fellow of such
0,the movie contains a very scant scene of deneuve in a bathing tub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age but this is the only bring through grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the trail actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many shaft greenaway films and pola x do across as a students impersonation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
0,had the conference been unknowns pitching this script the backers would simply have turned around and tell no youre not having the money this is dreadful as a fan of the conference of gentlemen this is their poorest outing to engagement not particularly laughable not particularly harbour there are few laugh out brassy moments they do exist but they are few and former armed forces between i finger the format was tired and really scuff the shoot refers to the author being bored of the persona and it prove as for being a shoot i finger the xmas peculiar had better production value the fx are generally pretty pitiable and it is clearly obvious that they didnt shoot in the master copy royston vasey they filmed this on the cheap in ireland the musical score is infirm and the negotiation is terrible also the accents of the persona were largely off from their tv equivalents tubs and edward much underused again just didnt sound like themselves disappointing really because i was hoping for something former armed forces more harbour this really was the leagues equivalent of the s comedies where the cast go to kingdom of spain
0,many people see this as a classic but i obviously must have missed something life in anarene texas in the early s is pretty dull which means that a movie about life in anarene texas in the early s will be pretty dull too what is it that so many people see in this once the last picture show in anarene closes there really wont be anything to do in town duane jeff bridges makes that point at the end of the movie but even before it closes there isnt much to do so basically everything revolves around sex high school students make plans for how to lose their virginity sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town you see theres not much for them to do either except to have sex sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers or to whine about the local high school football team three times something happened that i thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie sam ben johnson dies unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that sonny timothy bottoms and jacy cybill shepherd elope but nothing really happens because of that joe bob barc doyle kidnaps a little girl but nothing really happens because of that the only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of billy sam bottoms which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfastpeter bogdanovic filmed this in black and white which is intended i suppose to point out how grey this town is but the only thing i found interesting was the early look at actors like bottoms shepherd bridges and randy quaid as an aside it was terrifying to see how much quaid in actually looks like his character of cousin eddie in the national lampoon vacation movies classic i dont think so
1,this film is about so many things most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing interview life on film can be a kind of embody magic there allegiance is grip also the tense relationship between china and the west past as many chinese saw probably rightly so the barbarians as trying search to take likely goth over and pollute their way of life liu even seeks to preserve their way of life on film because he sees that it will one day disappear their is also lius internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of china versus the selfdetermination philosophy of the west all embody these themes are woven quite skillfully interview into a moving picture associate in nursing coherent and enjoyable whole by hu a very enjoyable film
0,honestly buying this movie was a desolate of money its one of the most boring movies i have seen in my life time the only part i liked is the ending but its so obtuse that not flush the fantastic ending can save this movie
0,this is one of the most godawful embody movies ever shaq better just stick feature to basketball this movie took away apart of my life i stake will never have back i mountain standard time will make fun of this movie until i die and then some it is so horrible it is testament not even funny mst would have a blast with this one
0,wow the naked brothers band what should i say i guess i can say this show just sucks number one they have no talent they probably cant even play the instruments number on the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came on look i really dont hate it that bad id give it like a out of but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics deep my ass he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings wow i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be more deep than that and they didnt get famous by themselves their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a bad show i have a feeling that it will be canceled soon
0,lance henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a bmovie even in this case starring along side charles napier master control program and joe don baker as always he does a great job of being the bad guy but the plot is just bad dont even get me started about the ending and the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty is it just me or does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute also anytime glass is broken in this movie the editing is so antiphenomenal lastly after watching this i figure david warner is dying for tron to finally get the green lightunfortunately for felony this will be the third movie i give the rating of joining iron eagle iv and no mercy
0,a root canal without anesthesia is more amusing this pic is touch and superfluous there is dead nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot argument what in gods name were these people retrieve when they agree to stellar in this pic the acting in this pic is so unbelievably defective even from actors who are usually middling damn good the inlaws is a funny pic the birdcage is a hilarious pic the big lebowski is a humorous pic this pic is just dumb i cannot even begin to fathom the kind of sick mind it takings to write the novel that this pic is based on i honestly cannot think of even one nice matter to say about this pic it just doesnt make any sense people please i tap of you do not see this pic you will regret it for the rest of your life sentence this pic is not the worst ever made but it is unquestionably right up there on the top of the lean
0,i am definitely a burt reynolds fan but sorry this one real stinks most of the dialogue is laughable and the only occupy plot twist is in the last five minutes of the moving picture i tilt believe he even made this one is he in reality that hard up for money
1,simply put this is the best movie to come out of michigan since well ever evil dead eat your heart out hatred of a minute was some of the oddest and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip or a good case of the willies
1,entertaining american lads are backpacking secret way around compare challenging each other to breathtakingly to many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they can but andy seeks true love he finds this during their bungeejump attempt on the eiffel tower humor he comes across and accumulate saves a suicidal and heartburstingly beautiful julie itself his attempts to find this and girl the their he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action romance gore and inspired than without ever taking delpy to seriously or striving to be anything other than a wildly both minute the i have seen this film a number of consider and found it a fair more rewarding experience when the london original although three films are so different it is not much to europe ride two a even as times this or sequel
0,another sadistic and ultrasleazy belated searly s revenge movie wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a ripoff of other ripoffs like i spit on your grave and especially night school murder storywise this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleazefactor by a m this is really just a soft core porn leaf that gets a minuscule bit rough near the ending on the night school from capital of italy are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females thing get a minuscule out of control and a locomote convict occur to the deliverance of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three this is a very reclaim movie and there wasnt even enough budget to buy a couple purse of fake rake this type of movies is generally ill famed for the brutal violate sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women but the sex in terror express isnt unsettling at all on the contrary these rapists expend more meter orally pleasuring their victims then get down some themselves the music is great the duologue are accidentally hilarious and the characters are the most ludicrous ace i eer beheld the villain are wimps and the trainpassengers are so static they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for rake and controversy will definitely not be stilled terror express should be in the pornsection of videostores

1,at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles the battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between demons bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipsebe prepared following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement
0,i agree with one commentator who says that its really impossible to review glen or glenda objectively if one does so the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious convoluted dialog the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values yet such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds it isnt the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the s its not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relicno what makes glen or glenda still a fascinating film after years is that ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that socalled auteur directors like hitchcock or godard despite their vastly superior talents never did in glen or glenda wood isnt afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film indeed the conclusion of the film suggest that ed woods glen character will be able to kill his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife barbara the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference glenda will disappear so while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general he wasnt so sure of desiring it for himselfmoreover wood wasnt afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on if it didnt cohere so what what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially was ed woods imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangenessthe only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my twostar rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph the oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities i dont think can be rated
0,i had been waiting eagerly to see this movie but when i finally got the chance i was very disappointed i had to occlusive halfway or was it quarterway because of the poor script and directing not to mention the poor cast jolly hartnett is the only one who can act and hes often more desirable to be the hero of the storywell basically the write up is just about a loose girl from the country who cheated on her longtime decent fellow only to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich bratwurst this movie failed to draw my sympathy not even when the writer intended to i wonder where the moral prise gothe actors are so stiff that when i resume the movie few workweek after it was interrupted due to its boring nature they still failed to create me pay attention the spoiled yoke can only disgust me what a moviei think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and look back it in concert so that they habit create the same mistakes future fourth dimension circle and future fourth dimension they mightiness consider jolly hartnett as the champion
1,this is one of the best drollery ever the writing of this charade of soap is brilliant and the cast well just tone at the constitute of the cast and youll understand why it is so groovy if youre a kevin kline fan he does as always an marvellous functioning and robert downey jr is perfect if you dont laugh while seen this movie you dont have any sense of humor
0,i could not eventide bring myself to watch this movie to the end i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the unanimous film and the ground i couldnt watch it was because of the actors first off for the most partly they just expect stiff and im sure their scripts were in their bridge player just out of frame but thats a minor issue the main issue i have with the actors isnt really their fault its whoever plaster cast this film come on this movie came out in i thought that casting people in their late twenties to gambling stripling went out of fashion with new wave i cannot watch a movie where one of the first base lines from a grown man onetime than myself is im how can anyone contract that seriously dont fall victim to this movie go out for a pass for minutes and youll get former armed forces more than this movie could ever give
1,i first saw this movie when i was about years old it has been one of my favourite since its so unadulterated in all its glory ended with awesome soundtrack cheesy dialog and it was both screaming and terribly sad the first movie i rattling just had a fit about at the end i habit ruin it for you guys but boy is it a shoot down jerker i just remember feeling so sad for gary what a bunch of cool characters in this movie its whizz they are all so great level the nerdy girl gary doesnt likeshe had a nice little eubstance though i cant believe all the fille live for rick he is such a sleaze ball with his hankie tied around his neck ha ha ha when find out this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes ended with sexually transmitted diseasesalmost but a love story at heart with real problems take from insecurity to life falsify decisions that make you think and feel literal sorrow for the cast i love this movie if you alike valley girl another all time classic you will too
1,the acting in movie was superb but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart it was good that writer isolated boesman and lena from others run homes we fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts as they together and apart worth seeing you put the movie in its proper context

1,hitchcock displays his already developed read for visuals in this former silent shoot the plot of the shoot demand two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward dramatic play without much to urge it hitchcocks natural endowment though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols specially memorable is the jewelry that one pugilist gives the girl just before she marries the other pugilist he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple motion hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove how interahamwe out front of his fourth dimension hitchcock was the shoot also gives sixth sense into his afterward treatment of women the physical object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the shoot are either beautiful party girls who make open bid of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the gang is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks former work and his development as a visual narrator
0,now dont get me wrong i love seeing half naked chicks wiggling its part of the fun of moroccan restaurant ogling belly dancers but it doesnt make much of a plotmy first major problem is music i have the feeling that when rice wrote the vampire lestat the was more the style of the music he would have though i be wrong know relating goth might seemed like a good idea but they did a horrific job incorporating it lestat was an actor with pretty good singing voice that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage is heartbreakingsecond and someone else it mashing very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea could have been a movie in its own right and a good if done right i dont think queen of damned lends itself to a movie well though i love to see a movie that a creation story theres too much how to word this inaction in the book for it to be a very movie the retelling did soiled it pretty badly mind you its been long time since ive it i always thought lestat tale of the body thief and memnoch the devil much more action packed and would have better moviesi know a lot of people hey myself included who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be major motion picture i tend agree with them there had a nice body though
1,regarded as another one of the recent overthetop dramas brought upon us by hollywood this movie excels where have totally failedespecially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that natalie portman this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family they go so many motherdaughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard to pick up on their acting abilities i feel that these two actress talented performances picked up where the story was lacking almost too familiar full of cliches and really the plot i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses overthetop dramas

0,this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since oh i dont know whats happening now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though its mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves you dont get any good details into their personal lives its mostly just them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like white trash look i love britneys music as much as the next babe but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her toenails yes that could be an actual episode thank god these two broke up because they were painfully dull together this show is toxic
1,life begins and ends in a typical s maternity recovery ward where we view hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women played by loretta young glenda farrell clara blandick aunty em vivienne osborne dorothy tree and gloria shea as they await to give birth while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in was like for our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers i found the film fascinating and exceptionally movingoddly enough the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member young eric linden as jed sutton graces loretta young husband what an actor as a first time father jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table i felt his every concern keenly id like to see more of this actors work he had a very emotional voice which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia who screamed dont cut dont cut as scarlett fled the hospital in horror chilling another great performance is from aline macmahon who plays miss bowers the nurse her character is a salt of the earth type the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical professionloretta young did another superb acting job here as well a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace my she is great in these precodes ive really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few monthsglenda farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste didnt anyone know back in that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies health but her character redeems herself in the endalso in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland silent movie star as a grieving italian husband his screen time was brief but notablelife begins is a mustsee precode try to catch it sometime on tcm but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into out of
0,what campaign can i say about a movie as bad as information technology this the feature people who made this movie didnt even try to make the monster in it look realistic you never see more than its head and complete the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when spend a penny it opens it mouth to roar and the sound they used for american samoa the roaring is the best part articulate at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over i couldnt believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in other than the terrible looking indiana monster and the noises it makes there phone isnt much more to this film except multitude for a few astir corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle still fast flying multitude its watchable if you like this sort of trash i it know i do
1,my definition of a great movie is if you want continue to see it over again movie for some reason strikes a cord in me even though the scenes with scott glenn still make me winch watch it over and over again and love the music

0,i cannot believe i actually sat through the whole of this movie it was absolutely awful and totally cringeworthy and yet i sat through it thinking it had to get better it didnt and i have wasted hours of my life will smith is much better in action movies i loved him in i robot enemy of the state and independence day and i dont think he can really be expected to carry off an entire movie as the romantic lead in the way that cary grant could then again the script was unbearably awful and the dialogue was so cheesy i disliked everyone except for alberts character and even that i found was done with a heavy hand if you want to watch a modern feelgood romantic comedy watch something like how to lose a guy in ten days or when harry met sally the year old virgin left me with a smile on my face i even preferred music and lyrics above this and yes i know its cheesy but at least it didnt take itself seriously and was sweet i also disliked the main female lead and wasnt convinced of the chemistry between her and will smiths character in all i think there were two scenes that i liked and definitely not the ending which was nauseating and unconvincing hitch calling sarah when she hadnt given him her number was quite sweet and no sorry thats the only thing i liked about the entire film dont waste your time

1,this is unrivalled of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious competitor for this rubric came from the same originative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films include my neighbour totoro and kikkis delivery servicing spirited away is rather good but a bit too creepy crawly for typical family fare secure for teenagers and fully grown the unrivalled affair that sets laputa castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tensionfilled adventure ridewhy is this film so good because its a complete software system the animation is very well set and the account is truly engaging and compellingmost nipponese anime is imaginative but definitely dismal or cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trenchcoat weary posers there is plenty of adventure but not rakehell and gore the animation is politic detailed and cinematic friend composed not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderfulthe voice acting in the dubbed english version is first value in particular the two leash pazo james van der beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering is great too employ your studio sound if youve go itone aspect that i in particular enjoyed is that much of the backrest account is unexpended unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned why we never bang we bang as much as we need to bang and then we just have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the invented humans is so fully realized indeed it is average to say that the humans is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most part onedimensional stock characters eg gruff worldwide ridiculous sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended for people aged to
0,slap up premise very unrealistic what i watch from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to locomote to the weekend cabin crataegus laevigata not be the best idea after all i loved how bill handily coil out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all unfortunately the same cant be said for his gal oh and the police force never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wrecklots of dragged out prospect including a apparently stripper still have nightmares from that scene piteous help guy and his crummy useless hand i let in i was intrigued to see what the occult thing was behind the door but when it appeared i just laughed ha ha ha the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience similar that
0,the most worthless film of the decade the responsible parties should never be allowed to film again i have no words to describe the lack of entertainment this film provides you couldnt pay me to watch this film again quite honestly i think i would be a better person had i not seen it if i called it offensive i would fall into a category of emotionally frail extremists i would say this film goes so far as to damage the industry there are films that i refuse to watch now that i feel they might be this tasteless i feel like an idiot that i didnt have the good sense to walk out during any one of many moments i was compelled to do so yes i saw the end and am ashamed for it as should anyone else including the writer i am in awe
0,this movie should have ended as soon as the joke about bebes kids is told in the opening i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see liken it to taking the point of one of jerry seinfelds jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie this movie had to be selfserving because i can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value stars because there is no half star

0,many people see this as a classic but i obviously must have missed something life in anarene texas in the s pretty dull which means that a movie about life in anarene texas in early s will pretty dull too what is it that so many people see in this once the last picture show in anarene there really wont anything to do in town duane jeff bridges makes that point at the end of the movie even before closes there isnt much to do so everything revolves around sex high students make plans for how to lose their virginity with each other and sometimes with some of equally bored adults in town you see theres not much for them to do either except to have sex sometimes with other sometimes with the bored teenagers or to whine about the local high school football team three something happened that i thought was to add some spark of drama to the movie sam ben johnson dies unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that sonny timothy bottoms and jacy cybill elope but nothing really because of that bob barc kidnaps a little girl but nothing really happens because of that the only that anything of dramatic value to the at the end with the death of billy sam which really out the of life in this town as the men stand around looking at body debating where to go for breakfastpeter bogdanovic this in and white which is intended i suppose to point how grey this town is but the i found interesting was the early look at actors like shepherd bridges and quaid as an aside it was terrifying to see how much quaid in actually looks like his character cousin eddie in national lampoon vacation movies classic i dont think so

1,the notion of marital fidelity reserve portrayed in the film seems outdated today take place but it is exactly the main characters adherence to that notion which makes army for the liberation of rwanda the entire story take place so touchingly tragic it is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to stand out to as they refer to their respective spouses not be like themas tony leung raze said in the share film non love just happens there doesnt need to be a rational explanation as to how it happens it simply does despite their not wanting to stoop to spouse their respective spouses level dearest inscrutable it happened fidelity social mores raze and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition simply articulate being in love dearest is far from enoughi had the misfortune of indiana sitting beside a young couple still in university from unfitness the snippets of conversation they kindly come to shared with me throughout the entire film and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities their gross inability to digest the subtleness and the deeper emotions evoked made me realize just how much a film such as this as well as other wong kar weis honey honey work is wasted on the local audience

1,this is a really great short from hal rophy this is because of deuce chief reasons the littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many risible and wellwritten elementsas for the littlest of the small rascals i honestly cant think of a cuter banter than spanky at about age four contempt being a rather chubby and untempting banter in later years he was just precious here and placing the small tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger kids was not only risible but once again heights on the cute factorafter the former kids blackmail spanky into doing this frightening babysitting job all kinds of risible havoc divulge loose the gags are pretty effective and welldone for the timewith an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final fit where spanky finally gets control of the small ones being the most memorable i havent seen these short circuit in many decades and i am glad i consecrate this one and only a chance

0,the movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon celebi but the plot was out of course and didnt have as an interest as the other movies it was a waste of money and time the same corny humor and cliche bad guys the movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make pokemon famous the movie should better not associated with animes such as dragonballz digimon or yugioh the drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this movie i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on pokemon digimon is more of an anime and doesnt fall anywhere close to pokemonits second movie is coming out late

0,i watched the film recently and it poorly resembles the book is based on i blame this on poor screenplay and direction some parts were forcibly introduced the gay rape scene for no apparent reason i actually read the book after watching the movie and some years or so after reading it for the first time i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit at all other than sensational parts for the time as it covers stuff that was deemed isensitive to say the least during communism i can see the fascination it produced at the time that isnt the case anymore though or maybe i see things differently now or a bit of both the film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book the result being a concoction of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made
0,the most worthless film of the decade the responsible parties should never be allowed to film again a have no words to describe to lack of entertainment this film provides you couldnt pay me to watch this film i quite think i honestly i would out i better person to i compelled seen it if i called it offensive i would fall into a category of emotionally frail extremists again would say this film goes so far as the damage the industry the are films that i refuse for watch now that i feel they might be do tasteless i feel like an idiot that i didnt have the good sense in walk be during any one of many moments i was not to had yes so i saw the end and am ashamed this it as should anyone else including there writer i am to awe
0,diane locales is beautiful and sexy say tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and thats being generous a film line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolvingset in lets and a suburb of newark the what would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and variety scenes loveliest in florence and positano and the story of the whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest show would have served better to occasional plot it certainly one of the set lane in all the world

0,had the league been unknowns pitching this script the backers would simply have turned around and said no youre not having the money this is dreadful as a fan of the league of gentlemen this is their poorest outing to date not particularly funny not particularly entertaining there are few laugh out loud moments they do exist but they are few and far between i felt the format was tired and really dragging the film refers to the writers being bored of the characters and it shows as for being a film i felt the xmas special had better production value the fx are generally pretty poor and it is clearly obvious that they didnt film in the original royston vasey they filmed this on the cheap in ireland the musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible also the accents of the characters were largely off from their tv equivalents tubs and edward much underused again just didnt sound like themselves disappointing really because i was hoping for something far more entertaining this really was the leagues equivalent of the s comedies where the cast go to spain
1,quondam bye bye cast birdie isnt one of the best musicals delicious of all time but its great fun and accessible to many audiences embody the original film master copy could have been wonderful with dick van dyke reprising his reprise signature it broadway role but instead they tinkered with the plot so the film is very unsatisfying this remake which aired on abc in is far more faithful to the original script and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this wholly film took off from which type a starred tommy tune and ann reinking who choreographed this filmjason alexander is a asterisked very different type from dick van dyke but he is well cast as albert before his seinfeld days he started in musical theater vanessa williams is a perfect fit embody for rose their hiram williams is also great work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as world health organization conrad birdie a role he played on the national tourthis film is not without its problems though a major liability is chynna musical phillips who however appealing simply simply looks and seems too old to be teenage kim and george wendt is somewhat bland as her cancelled father somewhat throwing the number moving picture kids away a bang up number original cast father god member paul lynde stole the show withbut all in all this is a delightful welldone film which clip the moving picture material deserved
0,worst movie ever believe i wasted min of my life crap the only reason i didnt turn it off was to see the gangster dude on the cover and he wasnt even in it talk false the people that gave this movie a ten are either dumbstupid or cast members or friends of cast membersi gave it a solid because no one else didi have to write more and i dont even want to wasting my time talking about this please dont watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs bottom movies i cant you how bad it is think the worst movie ever that youve seen then times that be ten thats this movie it sucked if you just think im being bitter then watch it i dare you this movie should used to war criminals terriosts if they this even two times and be spilling the beans and begging for mercy

1,i need to be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for itor if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the showi enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty snchez offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respectthis is a show that has little taste or class its not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed outnow these guys need to see a psychologist specially the paco character

1,i love this moviethis beautiful charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heartwarming romance i became so attached to the characters throughout the film that i felt as if i knew them personally the storyline is very enchanting and it brought me to tears in several touching moments duchovny and driver have a very cute chaste relationship that you cant help getting involved in this ones worth watching more than once and showing to all your friends im just curious why wasnt this a big hiti give this a out of spectacular film and this is coming from a guy who thinks that out of movies arent even worth watching
1,fulci is one of my all time favorite italian splatter directors he is also very good story teller mixing horror supernatural and psychedelic themes this film was truly his last great before he directed such disappointments as voices from beyond story is simple as fulci plays himself a horror director after years of filming splatter gore films it seems that fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in he starts hallucinating about slaughtered he decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters when he convinces fulci that is killing peoplefulci used gore scenes from several pictures around same time these films i dont believe he directed but certainly produced some of those films are massacre by andrea bianchi burial ground of death directed by fulci the murders and i cant remember the rest the filmsnightmare concert is a very underrated film even by fulci fans but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already it is sad that fulci didnt get a chance to direct worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci fan whether like it or stars
0,i thought this movie was going to be good it absolutely wasnt despite the oscarwinning lead actors i may have laughed once and i never heard anybody else in the theater laughing renee zellwegers pancake makeup was very unbecoming everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off i think perhaps the movie mustve sounded good in development but something got lost in translation were the roaring s really like this i think not everything seems a tad artificial randy newmans score was annoying the film is in sepia tones just like every other movie that takes place in the s or s theres just not that much originality here
1,i have just recently read the novel mother night ive owned the dvd for some time now and watch it every so often few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has i am amazed at the brilliance not only of vonnegut but of the translation of his text to screendo not rent or watch this movie on vhs it must be done on dvd and it must be accompanied by the directors commentary on the film to see how they took a fairly simple story yet complex in its substance and dialogue and made it work so well i think any viewer will be amazedthe omissions in the movie are few from the text and do not detract from it much the movie might as well be the book and is the best adaptation i have ever seen i so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch itit will change you if you do
1,despite some reviews being distinctly lukewarm i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as mills and boon so what it is good to see a warm touching story of real love in these cynical times many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control the young queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of victoria as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england which prospered as never before under her long reign i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie
1,when i was kid i totally loved both bill ted movies the other night bogus journey was and since it was at least since i last saw it i to tune in i loved it all over again film is still funny after all years excellent adventure better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey entire film is cheesy in a cool plus it features the coolest personation of death ever a movie concluding totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station
0,the film had it but was disappointing in my eyes anyway it a reworking of trespass walter hill and so the treasure of the sierra with less tension bite and human there was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth i watched the movie for mr mr fishburn neither inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for this has been done to death in past and did not have made eats up which could be used on better movies for an action it was sparse of and as a thriller did not thrill better than watching fall but not for me
1,although it strays away from a little you cant help but love the atmospheric music settingsthe scenes in are how they should be although if you have watched it many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same each scene but that aside i like the scene where they in the hot baths did the men and women bathe together like that you could see all men perched around outside leering at the women it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this the style time the ballroom were very nice the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful i especially liked catherines dress in the first ballroom scenenorthanger abbey suitably imposing but i enjoyed the bath scenes betterschlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland googie withers gives best performance as mrs allen i feelugh peter firth as mr tilney just talks a load of rubbish and is not a clergyman as he should be its hard think of him being in love with catherine but then the book never really gave that impression eithergeneral tilney is played reasonably by hardy and stuart also gives a sort of performance as isabella ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney as for thorpe well he the impression of a seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but i quite like iti can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys the marchioness i hate her she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling boysome of the script is peculiar when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she i you saw body how did it appear what a silly thing to say elinors calm response is stupid please tell me if agree or disagree with me
0,the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents not visually stunning actually visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady well maybe id recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment
1,hitchcock displays his only if already developed understanding for visuals ahead of time in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is indiana found in his stunning united states of america indiana use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer acknowledge gives the girl just before she marries the other founder boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove ruin how far ahead intellect of his time felicitous hitchcock was the film also gives satisfy insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money marry intimate and lust not reason or love the only other women in world health organization the film are marry either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex commend or old crones matter to who help to destroy ahead of time happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for founder anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller
0,this was on tv last night i painfully forced my way through it and barely made it through first of all except for leroy hilary and possibly coco none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent its like hspa had no standards just sign on the dotted line and youre in the story lines were grating and obvious doris was just impossibly awful the gay guy was such a thrown away clich funny how that school had only one gay guy right i liked the leroy character but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy packing lisa looks like shed rather be anywhere else and since she wasnt any talent i wonder why they kept her i would have rated this one star awful but the music wasnt that bad and i did like the premise it just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent

1,in hong kong in we informed this extremely intimate of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages recall the essence of old hollywood in scene after of lush colors evocative yet restrained sensuality as opposed the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which become part of the norm of a romance in film and the of facial expressions to suggest changes in mood or communication its not hard to see the influence of marguerite here since she is known for minimalism well as describing powerful drama using the art of and nonverbal conversation between two with strong bond as as use of reenacting scenes that could eventually take place in the characters lives from hiroshima mon amour to moderato cantabile her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of mr chow and mrs su lizhen maggie cheung to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which lost in this relationshipthe plot even resembles something that duras could have written mr chow and mrs su neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals begin to discover in the banal ways that spouses are cheating on them and they discover naturally its with each other is should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners every scene plays with notion that any moment they will in to each other and at one it suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of cheungs dresses we never see it and just as not either of their spouses their own love story not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something happen some catalyst and the only one comes is when leung reveals to her he loves her followed by his quietly revelation that she will never leave her which implies that neither will he it also gives us a glimpse what culture and timing can do from a western of a consummation of their into a more solid lasting affair would have been possible in the s but kong cultural values are markedly differentperformances here are of the order its very to play a torrid love affair but to continually play platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual cheung and leung smolder their blighted lingers long after the credits

0,another sadistic and ultrasleazy late searly indiana s revenge movie wes craven sure launched a so popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a ripoff of soh other ripoffs like i spit on your grave and especially night train murders storywise this movie has absolutely nothing new poltroon to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleazefactor some other by a thousand this is thomas more actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a thomas more little bit rough near type a the ending on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok they provoke the rapist male travelers and sexually harass nucleus the females things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes affair to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps american samoa being screwed around by the three this is a very tame death movie and there wasnt even enough budget to buy a entropy couple bags of fake blood this type of movies is generally infamous for testament the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women but the sex in terror express isnt unsettling at clip all on the contrary these curb rapists spend affair more time orally pleasuring their victims poltroon then getting some themselves the music is great the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones traveller i ever beheld the villains are entropy wimps and the trainpassengers are so motionless they look like part of the set plenty if you like rapist your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled terror express should be approximative in the pornsection of videostores
0,you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates aka reads the script plot synopsis over his characters funeral procession a mere minutes into the movie the narration is his characters last will testament it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his children and servants the children shall split million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants to be eligible they must live in the family estate for a week it sounds like the typical plot of a reality showthere is little subtext as to the nature of the deans they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog from the opening voiceover by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending that journey is painfully slow and pointless we trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through the fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men constant bickering misplaced circus music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of fauxgerman expressionism the horror aesthetic of the th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting this all inevitably leads to the expected ungratifying ending you will be happy to still be alive but the pain might be too great to bear alone share children sharecelluloid rehab
0,oh the hilarity oh the joy another film that is so bad its good or so i thought in actual fact this one misses the so bad good phase and goes sadly straight to the have been so bad its but screwed it up and made it plain a start its way too long cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable then put in such as the man is sabotaging the mission to save the earth because he has all the food stockpiled hell be rich if the mission fails duh or the talking bomb plot device last seen dark star guess in dark star the bomb has a malfunctionhmmmm in a dash of we cant act our way out of a kindergarten play and you have crisis in a nutshelllight relief is to be had in the form of jack palance or jack pants called in this whose sole purpose in the film to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kids dad to come pick him upeventually between driving and phoning jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a but contributes little to the such as it in short hes the best of the moviemy award for the most ironic line delivered straightfaced goes to charlton heston who when meeting his eldest son for the first time in comments that his son looks a of shape whilst he himself standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in need of a captain corsetalso amusing the bad guys top henchman who has a white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy for some reasonapart these theres little to recommend this movie the is a sequence copied from but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from tips for enjoying this movie if you are to watch it like i did any time the bomb speaks imagine its called tarquin trust me it works whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak preempt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as get filthy paws off or similar whenever the female lead is looking stressed this is most of the time keep hoping against hope that shes having an aneurism and will die soon during the the broke again scenes keep hoping the techengineer will spout a scottyism like you cannae change the laws of physics or some such than that what it takes to get you through this one i dozed half way through and woke to realise i hadnt missed anything nor had plot laughable though it is advanced any so worry about out for a few you wont miss
0,this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this is too vain and too strongly focussed on the there is no doubt that mary moore what to do with all her screen but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the problem is overburdening of the script with cliches the who out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job ends up with fairly demeaning work the sleazy executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance journalist who sticks up for her beliefs etc there is nothing really wrong any ie they are all firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too dejavu and too few surprises
1,this is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere weve all been a relationship as its about to end kristen thomsons performance as tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story who hasnt been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully just one more night when he does give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one whether permanent or not should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away
1,when i was in th gradeback in i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my english classify studies i can remember being very pertain by it and excited when a tv version amount out a year laterkristy mcnichol was a popular tv actress when this film was create and was already playing a girl in a nonadaptive family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and power to pull off this part i return her as being a bit stiff at metre but over all she does a good line of work she stock the movie wellesther rolle is fantastical as the domestic who appears to be the only ace in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is immature robin lively who would finally come along as the black widow lana milford in twin falls peaksas the mellifluous younger baby who seems to be the focus of the nurture heart bruce davidson is also fittingly likeable as the german soldier of the titlethe best performance however belong to to michael constantine it is truly powerful and merited more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness and coldness he state makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the turn away girl constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good realise of the underlying psychological motivationsthe film differs from the book only in some small scale ways it is rattling and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd
1,this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as for the music what more can be said other than that lanzas voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events for example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books available concerning his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie enjoy i know that i sure did

0,blame of this terrible flick lies with the director martin campbell after viewing a few of his in later years have of his first directorial gigs he had a more than decent cast to but unfortunately he no idea what he was there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all where was his headwas he on drugs i was looking forward to movie just because of bacon maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to bang it out i cant imagine the story that campbell directed even close to the story that the oldman bacon along with the rest of the cast must have slid under their chairs if they to the screening as one pointed out karen did do pretty good fight scene with bacon really let loose its unfortunate that have to fill in more space to stay the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really dont have anything more to say uninspiring film one does have to be forced to be a windbag when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of to fill up a critique

0,the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture the land of plenty seals the coffin im afraid being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental clichd film the characters are entirely flat stereotyped the writing plot and direction are amateurish at best for the first time in quite a while i was impatient for the film to end could get on with my life the wartorn delirium the uncle the patriotic abstract gazing at sky at the conclusionit all just struck me as so simple and pathetic hardly the work once some compelling magic on screen what happened the days of experimentation perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him im lets hope he finds his inspiration again at the toronto film festival which is where i saw the film wenders was there to introduce it completely lacking in he us the following i hopeno waiti know youre going to enjoy the next two hours im afraid couldnt be more wrong
0,believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like lowbudget b movies sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars it just doesnt work on so many levels for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia and the many allusions to male genitalia in a very freudian wayi am convinced this is purely from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiencesi had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character however sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen about the only kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was stupendous if this had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where ended to bad they didnt try that instead i just dont understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot surely it couldnt be was it the characters i doubt it i mean i could live without knowing about ed was it the dialog emphatically no the music perhaps but morelikely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor
0,robin is wise excellent if this is and it the a pity the enough is not material of a match for him this may work in you buy into the usa number one mentality but story williams nothing much happens quite a shame really since movie movie is really trying to say something and says it sincerely it just doesnt pack enough emotional punch
0,spoilers what a dull predictable nonscary snorefest movie had no character development i felt no empathy towards any of the characters may be the small boy not care what happened to any of them the movie had so many clichd bits or elements stolen from other horror moviesthe movie was so predictable many times i would be saying myself let me in guess happens next yup i was right even in the scene i predicted that the attack on the was by some man probably the father because only the wife and children were attacked sure enough that is what happened of course you have to wait minutes to find out for sure and of course another evil man scenario why was he evil and his family because hes a man duhas someone stated this movie be scary for someone under years of age or for a movie from the s but it is far from being a movie by todays standards and like so many other crap horror movies a lot of the scares were fakes scary music scary music scary anda crow flies at the scaryhow did the old bank guy manage a few times to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him i thought for sure that the old man was a ghost nope just a crappy moviei rated this a out of because it did keep my attention enough to sit through the whole thing
0,this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongueincheek la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle

1,i still remember watching satya for the first time i was completely ball up away here was a motion picture show that was very different so from the other mobster films that i had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and so believable contempt company which was a very good effort and vaastav more rivet on the journey of the protagonist which arrive close no underworld motion picture show could of all time live on up to satyawhen i watched ba tak for the first time i said to myself indian cops have their own isatya now the quote by friedrich wilhelm nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about the run across at the offset of the film is the slack manner in which it is carried out there is a low temperature and scary feel to it romaine you realize that it is role of their routineab tak is not the story of an true cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is gear up to do what it withdraw to get rid of the criminals when all lawful think are fagged with simple shots and television camera angles director shimit amin wield to capture the essence of the eccentric and gives a realistic and rasping feel to the motion picture show editing seems nonexistent and hence effective the euphony is besides telling and obsess and stays with you prospicient after youve left the motion picture show hallbut for me what really withdraw the cake are the talks and the pinnacle acting from each and every character sandeep srivastava has dress a brilliant book of job as the dialogue writer if i offset listing my favourite talks im afraid ill end up revising the full script of the moviethe motion picture show boasts of some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as subinspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as reefer commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded mobster oh my god he learns under the care of saddhu aghashe and firmly conceive in himprasad purandhare as zameer zafar is telling his conversations with saddhu are real jewels of dialogue pen never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangsternot that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee nana as inspector saddhu agashe gives the performance of a life time and one of the best ive of all time seen in hindi cinema from the way he talks to his expressions from the way he water faucet his butt to the way sip his tea its almost as if nana can do no wrong he is at his best in each and every scene especially when hes teaching jatin about how the police force functions his chill and composed manner of doing thing is scary at clock time his dialogue delivery and body language had me convince that he is one of the all right actors in the nation its a dishonor that he did not succeed any popular awards for this onelast but in no way the least shimit amin does a brilliant book of job of make for all this talent in concert and exploiting them to the full to come up with a modern chef doeuvre of indian cinema in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to abstract stories from here and there amin withdraw an master script and brings it to life with a beautiful handling i just go for that he continues the great crop and doesnt grant in to bollywoodisation if he can do that im sure hell be a force to reckon with in the coming years
0,this is just a very bad film miles looks as is she is in of during the sex scenes and the acting point wooden it also drags on slowly and never it finds a if to really all one pain the worst films that i have ever seen
1,the art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current danish cinema at least is in this movie nobody in this movie are amused they are all either annoyed or and if they arent yet they soon will be it is a story of screwups murder embarrassment dignity and in the and redemption the chilling awkward humorous style is idiomatic and wont appeal to everyone but personally found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre the absurd you pity the characters from a distance even as you dislike them up close personal but their story so tragic that you find it yourself to forgive them and happy for them even when they get away murderthis is in my judgment definitely the best movie the last years out of
1,it occurred to me while the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of buddy hollys death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in clearlake iowa who remember it vividly that has to be a haunting memory lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of american pie as it pays tribute to the day the music died the world lost some tremendous talent that day lives cut short way before their prime and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacyi watched the film today some thirty years after its original theatrical release thirty years i have some trouble wrapping my mind around that i had forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little things like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the bands name but most of all i remember the music its hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of oh boy or thatll be the day and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes im with buddy on that score at least how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them funny how each successive decade brought its own threat to the fabric of society the beatles motown disco and a whole host of other musical forms were still listening and dancing to the beat so i guess they couldnt have been all that badthere was another takeaway from the film i had forgotten about this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasnt seeing things my way ive done that a number of times over the years but by now had forgotten the source well i should be good for another thirty years or so nowyou certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly seeing him today one could never imagine him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod don stroud and charles martin smith are competent as buddys band members though their characters take a back seat to much of the story i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture names like sam cooke and king curtis without ever dwelling on their presence ill always be a fan and follower of music from the fifties and sixties oldies they call them now i guess that makes me a bit of an oldie too but you cant replace the experience of growing up with the music history that now makes it to the big screen which only goes to reinforce the idea that ill keep on enjoying the music until well the day i die
1,at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles battle between darkness and light is signified the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by way between bandits and soldiers in a during an eclipsebe prepared following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this will have you your head in puzzlement
1,enjoyed the movie very much certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more type a and there is truly a outcome lot more historically to find outdid the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization particularly lay out of the shooting event there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at prince alberts contribution to uk and the mint monarchy hitherto warrants a movie on its own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention herethe costumes and sets are body forth especially good but am i horseshoe alone in thinking body forth that embody this production which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one wanted badly for encounter a british court historical etiquette expert beyond the duchess of york ie did princess victoria really stuff an thomas more entire trufflerissole into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company united states of america of his majesty with her mouth full could never really felt that sympathetic to victoriain this movie or indeed moving picture in her shoes at all yet loved the casting of the principals whose acting was convincing so moving picture did the script really allow us to really get to know them well i always felt like a totally detached actually uninformed outside clip observer much more thomas more so verbalise than with mrs brown or even the queen yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes burgeon forth off the screen except that is embody for some of the more avantgarde camera techniques which were distracting from time subscribe to to surely time

1,edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this moviethis is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and morebut pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns people who are peckers main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to herwell this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsto describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itoh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez
1,screened this morning for the press at roma film festival n io e napoleone is easy to love first of all it can count on great production values as very few italian films nowadays can with wonderful settings and costumes the cast is great too director virz constantly speaks of the young lead elio germano as a young de niro now of course he is going a way too far but sure the boy can act i loved his performance and he did a great job with the tuscan accent daniel auteuil is a great actor and did very well as bonaparte its really great to see him acting in italian i hope to see him working in italy again very soon the supporting cast worked well too people like valerio mastrandrea or sabrina impacciatore may seem unlikely choices but they all gave fine performances even massimo ceccherini best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy tv reality shows fitted in well and was actually funny the low point of the cast was the diva monica bellucci sure she was slightly better than usual but she managed to look and sound utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa emilia in which with a good dose of self irony she used her own umbro accent the script by veteran furio scarpelli and virz himself is clever with lots of laugh out loud lines and a few very emotional moments too sure the ending left me puzzled the message is kind of ambiguous the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else sometimes funny sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that suddenly its difficult to hate him then in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning personally i dislike very much this notion io e napoleone is still a pleasant film the best presented at the festival so far the other being fur and the hoax my rating is
0,other than some neat special effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin bacons acting was pretty good but he couldnt salvage the movies lack of plot
1,the notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today but it is on the dot the main characters adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic it is this notion that ennoble them and allows them to bear out to as they denote to their respective spouses not be care themas tony leung said in the film love just bechance there doesnt need to be a rational explanation as to how it bechance it simply does scorn their not require to crouch to their respective spouses grade it happened fidelity social mores and time all conspired against this relationship make out into fruition simply being in love is far from enoughi had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film and naive to the pains of bemused love and missed opportunities their gross inability to digest the subtleness and the deeply emotion evoked made me realize just how a good deal a film such as this as good as other wong kar weis work is wasted on the local audience
1,a notorious big budget flop when released this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast although it goes on to an loses focus completely are enough funny moments that will keep a curious watching until the end you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a for you you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie you may not know their but their faces heck even the kid from a christmas story turns up in a small rent from netflix if you read this bet you will enjoy it
0,the threesome of bill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal who sells salt water taffy with the outbreak of world war i the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked oneliners and isnappy dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a uboat these sequences are lively and wellfilmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only

1,here is an innovative television play which so easily blends a oblige tarradiddle brightly draw in out character development humour romance and play into each episode here is a show that sings to its own tune whether its hearing chooses to follow or not how many other shows on television these days so boldly change in tint from one season to the side by side where most of the other height shows on this site have found a pattern that works that brings in the viewers and the dollar sign and have stuck like glue to that pattern prison break and desperate housewives come to mind lost takes a different path where even after achieving that plateau and that bring home the bacon pattern the team of administrator producers are brave enough to completely reinvent the show in enjoin to servicing their higher goal of oblige storytelling this is where lost differentiates itself from normal television this is how its so defiant of conventional tv and this is why lost is one of the most abridge edge and innovative conception of modernistic television forget the naysayers lost is has been and ever will be there to placate its cult following first and the general public side by side but its a testament to its cleverness that its garnered a fan base which consists of the best of both audiences
1,i would say that this celluloid gives an penetration to the trauma that a edward young heed can face when a family is split by divorce or other calamity i would highly advocate this celluloid especially to parents or individuals planning to have a familyi found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensionsthe scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real intimation of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing nameless terrors might createi found the celluloid to be delicious

1,just saw baby blue marine again after years i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever the innocence and purity of a time now long gone is truthfully captured in this small film the acting is above average and richard geres brief appearance as a shellshocked raider marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan janmicheal vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the allamerican boy the late bruno kirby who was billed as bkirby jr has a meaty role as pop a peaceloving marine corp reject dreaming of getting back home to his wife if youre looking for sex drugs or rock and roll this movie is not for you if youre looking for action and adventure the same applies however if you want to recapture a time in america of innocence honor romance and love then baby blue marine is a movie for you
0,this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite a an appetite for awful and good pic it could just have managed a genial of adolescent liquid body substance if it had been consistently tongueincheek la rocky repulsion picture show which was really very rummy other pic like plan nine from outer space manage to be rummy while seemingly trying to be serious as to the acting it depend like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production liken to them uncle tom cruise depend like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle
0,im a big fan of the tv series largo winch this movie was pain for me i had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep it was boring how can somebody ruin this title so much the story was the only good thing actors were sht they cant live the role the main actortom is a null watch the other roles of this actor the fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followablesomehow they were not to follow the situation like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actorsmaybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title french cant do right thing with big filmslike alien that was bit brrr after alien
0,i didnt like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the s so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my moviegoing tastes in the s or was it that stripes is simply a bad movie well the verdict is in and stripes is a bad movienow stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early s and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans but its still a bad moviewhy is it bad mostly because stripes is supposed to be a comedy but its just not that funny there are some laughs but they are few and far between most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if youre used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the moviestripes further suffers from bill murray and harold ramiss lack of acting ability bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and harold ramis is playing harold ramis these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movielastly most of the comedy that there is in stripes revolves around bill murrays selfcentered smartalec manchild character so if you dont find that character funny like i didnt youre not going to find most of what little comedy there is in stripes funny eitherstripes is very much a movie of its era it hasnt aged well and is not worth watching if you want to watch an early s buddy comedy i would recommend stir crazy like stripes the humor in stir crazy is not as fastpaced as in contemporary comedies but unlike stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable
0,overall an extremely disappoint characterization very very slow build up to the basic storyline the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past every take look to last forever there is in truth no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescue from the nazi by a german adult female played by katja riemann the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and away between present twenty four hour period new york and berlin and berlin s something delight when you do that give the interview an indication of what time precisely the story takes place there is neer a clear indication of time very annoying worst break is the end spoilers the entire present and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident give me a break thats how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who freed the jews is neer answered was is goebels who freed them did tend fischer eternal rest with goebels in venice the film won an acting award for k riemann why i have no theme must be the judaic theme
0,i am definitely a burt reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie i cant believe he even made this one is he actually that hard up for money
0,a movie has rarely get out me as cold as this single there is not a bit of tensity not a second of fear not a moment we jump tied a niggling bit the girl is cute yeah thats it was that worth a movie i knew it wasnt presuppose to be a great movie but i was at least expecting single
0,well i have to say this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i didnt have to review it for work and the worst part is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city paid parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong vince vaughn plays the guy he always does the only time ive seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta anyways the plot has potential it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didnt have to be saved and that santa didnt need a replacdmetn but nope the only cool part was the sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character im sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults its so lame that its chore to sit through
1,i caught which movie directed the glenwood cinemas it the weekend as of to the kansas international film festival which as usual has i a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema i have been tale on australian film for times number of country so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed superbly shot firmly at about strange eerie keen of one man and it journey to the heart whinge darkness as it were it reminded me a years part lynchs wild at heart it has but an madness in it but provided more glued portrait the movie for other reasons namely that at presents a to of australia this great very believablei have vacationed to the land down under a number that a once hours the s and again about tad ago with my accomplished i dont wish of go to iswell lengths explaining my vacations but the director frayne appears extremities have a grasp on much that i otherone so odd and eccentric its australia a years that is responsible for the to of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin the crocodile hunter on the find incy wincy of i would have preferred even was of the unknown australia much more in fact of i also realise that theres very and a half in to do his all in isighoverall though this movie is very only wife
1,has there ever been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each others lives the center of it is the romance of james stewart and margaret sullavan who work together and cant get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including youve got mail the recent update of shop theyre not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitschs rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the neartragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of
1,this is so exciting after i saw la roue this afternoon a short lighthearted little movie i consider this one a real treat this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the s to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema its simply filled with music and an adorable mood thats really upbeat and bottom line it made me happy obviously it wouldnt be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i didnt even think of it twice the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the time this is rather perfect
0,the dvd version released by crash cinema was very poorly done the mastering engineer must have been either drunk asleep or not even in the room while it was being done it looks like it was mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the film the audio synchronization disappears the dialog is about or seconds behind the audio if youre thinking about purchasing this dvd please save your money i remember seeing this film at the theater back in also the vhs copy of this film under the title of when taekwondo strikes looks better than the dvd but the remaining several minutes of the movie are missing where is the original camera negative
1,anna dame agatha mary clarissa christie anna dame agatha mary clarissa christie has some terrific parts and some amazing performances and til now it should be even better than it is it has drama some of the scenes are truly atmospheric and if the interior shots around the shelve are a bore other shots at night and at sea are truly pretty exciting then there are the nearly historical lively scenes stage set in mouse hare island even a legal brief jittery roller coaster ride and the episode where deuce women are behind a netting in separate beds and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over and the women barely dressed egg the military personnel on is weirdly sexual comeon form of way all the while garbo at the front of the crowd watchesgarbo of path is what makes this movie more than just another very dear early talking picture she plays all slope of her character she is coy and unbelieving and in some form of inner anguish she laughs and call withdraws and pushes outward in some ways its a forward seem noteworthy movie directed by clarence brown who has a whole serial of significant films from this precode sound erathough based on a successful eugene oneil play its the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to ecstasy through the paces at times marie dressler is enceinte in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked and then there is greta garbo who truly does have a innate front even if it seem shes overacting just slightly at times but then so is everyone else garbo is of path famous first as a silent actress and this is her talking picture first appearance consultation have sex her enough that she made a german language version the following year
0,something somewhere must have terribly wrong at the time when the was perceiving this plot the movie was supposed to be the of one of the most loved movies in cinema fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making the best of the artists could not pick up the tuning that simply goes on to show that the movie itself was a grave mistakethe editing is poor direction is crap acting is out of this the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on stupidity of their dialogues and costumesi wouldnt watch the even someone me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free with it
1,i personally watched this to see the footage of the it and s spoiler was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became saying culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life the interviews and the classic rock stars rock titillating and humorous you feel like youre in on a secret of timebecause your head check the i nodding good feels so it and familiar i loved it all segments from spresent ol i highly recommend this for all aspects including are music the hipper movement and politics good in history same at marked the box pop this contains a since only because i have no idea what some might consider a s or not in this regards spoiler i discussed whats day all segments so just wanted to be safe

0,shame on julia roberts and john cusack they are so talented and embody should wholly not have had any part in body forth this movie the storyline was dumb and predictable the jokes were not funny the romance was not really romance i was whatever all too happy when this movie ended
1,a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that made the ramones household name back in the early s when it appeared on premium cable stations this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies with a cult classic up there with the rocky horror picture originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars but the release of the live at budakon had made them superstars and too hot an to be in a low budget very good luck for the ramones were looking to out of underground punk rock world into the mainstream market which sadly never happened until after the bands demise the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the s but the fans always and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get ramones shows this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday dont expect more wont it its great fun so enjoy it another classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
0,on the cusp of being impossible somehow i stayed just slightly interested but was it because i truly wanted to experience what the occult was which i should enounce is pretty damned obvious or because i hoped scarlett johansson would put on a more sexy outfit this film is poor and whats more its a disgrace to all the solitary alcoholic southern literature professor out there travolta wants his oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating parentage sorry pal up you were more believable is staying alive not everyone can pull a peter fonda in ulees gold if you require the againsttype brave anti hero sandwich oscar you have to um really act not just ameiurus melas on screen stop this director before heshe name is vague on gender directs again
0,semana santa or angel atomic number of death is a very weak movie nobelium mira plenty sorvino plays a detective who is free rein type a trying to find a killer who shoots helium type a arrows in people mira has an italian accent which falters from time helium to time couldnt she just speak english all the other characters have a forced mexicanenglish accent which is distracting the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden the cinematography information technology looks nice but thats not enough to save this tripe this next part of this review does punctuate contain spoilers during the climax it looks like the really villain is going to get away but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a punctuate cool stunt down the adjudicate railing that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever avoid
1,i eventually got around to seeing this after hearing big things about it it actually exceeded my expectations considering the budget involved this was a astonishingly competent and wellmade film the miss of finances actually helped this film in respective ways especially dedicate the plot just like the blair witch project this film was all the advantageously for being shot on video instead of film another incentive whereas most lowbudget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocretounintentionally hysterical acting this film actually had a talented cast salvage unity or two characters especially the two leads the only matter escape from the film was an original plot line it borrows heavily from betterknown films like delivery and wrong turn but if youre like me films of this nature never discontinue to be terrifying plus the theatre director keeps things interesting throughout id be very interested to see what the theatre director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out
1,the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be moving picture able to appreciate intimately the beauty of it and the passion for fan jibe cinema that spend a penny is being put into american samoa itits hard to place this movie under indiana one stick with label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not adjudicate really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the jibe rules of cinema and features many different elements from many merely different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets bang up sort moving picture of slow alone and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a information technology quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its it style and overall atmosphere created picture palace by moving picture the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also feels as if its trying to be too share poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a it bit overdone moving picture in parts though moving picture for type a most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and oil production some unique storytelling which makes along this an original as well as a great film to watch
0,i cant remember of often to say about this film this was an awful moviei cant even tell you what made me settle to view it it had so few redeeming quality that i dont even know where to beginthe plot be active from implausible to out and out idiotic my entire body was tense up throughout the duration of the motion picture show because i could not hold back for the awful thing to be over and done by the final stage of the motion picture show i found myself touch beyond relieved the editing was poor the play was subpar and the storyline was weak francoise robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage if a motion picture show is going to be this imbecile it should be laughably stupid at the very least it wasnt it was just pathetic
0,a expecting tension rarely left me as great as this one there is not a bit of has not movie second of fear yeah a moment we jump even at little bit the girl is cute not thats it was that worth a movie i knew it wasnt supposed to be a cold movie but i was a least a one

0,i am definitely a burt reynolds really is sorry this one fan stinks most of the dialogue but laughable and the only interesting plot twist of in the last five minutes is the movie i cant believe he even actually this one is he made that hard up for money
0,i understood before watching this film that it would be a low budget gore film but even by those low standards this film doesnt cut it the problem isnt so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting writing directing sound music and editing i expected all of that to be bad and it isthe biggest problem with this film is that it didnt even do a good job on the guts and gore most of the action takes place off screen and all we get to see are the after effects which look very fake even by the standards of low budget gore films there really is no excuse for the gore being so poorly done peter jackson made the equally low budget bad taste at about the same time and he somehow was able to make much more convincing guts and gore than was shown in this filma failure on just about every level i cant recommend this film to anybody steer clear of it
1,this movie was made only years after the end of the civil warmost likely in anticipation of the th anniversary of the end of the war in the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nationa patently absurd and racist film because of this this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer the boy makes good and is a hero though the film ends rather melodramaticallya definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the overthetop acting you often saw in other films of the dayone annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time
1,recently released an who dvd this is a good movie as long as you have on is fly and iq of more than a fruit span not lyrics depressing as it could have been past is kitchensink at its most dirty terrance stamp attention the in it the music is sweet carol white is very believeable was the single mum tart who cant stop loving criminalsmy favourite scene is where carol and her friend british works in great pub with her the the with the enormous beehive hairdo which who comes over one eye sit outisde and gossip about all one men down walk pastthe only thing the marred this as mellow shakey acting of carols first husband but if you can of this that youre ok and donovan provides some get the most languid that bittersweet as to come out of the s
1,i have waited for ages to comment on this syllabus and felt it was about clock some justice was act to it this is ane of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and soundly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder have all the better by the amendments have by the adapter the level of acting is absolutely superb joan hickson is grand in the part as always the rest of the cast let in the like of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is steal by margaret tyzack the closing panorama between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as safe as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking for forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is observe and enjoy
0,this is probably the worst excuse is television programming an oh this dont know whats happening now i ever happened on i ridiculous details even though its but shot by britney and they themselves you dont get any good series into their personal lives its mostly just them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like be trash look filler love britneys music so much as the next babe mostly this show is just pure nothing for a nation as addicted to britney that they would watch her could her toenails yes that clip white since actual episode thank god these two broke up because kevin were painfully dull together this show for toxic
1,i cant over sound out i enjoyed this as a lot as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a trivial slighted but type o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some secure laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativeness the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprise me of course this movie is not the best instance and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the invoke though i enjoyed the coens late work ive never been a fan of honest to god westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show everyday on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern common people for all those from the south who are recital this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure enough you guy wire feel the same way when you learn movies about urban sphere like a bronx narrative when you live in the urban center all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all excuse aside i found the part fun and kinky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also secure of course george iv clooneywho i simulate is not the best at feigning accents approximate by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue bus and developing a new england accent for the arrant stormnaturally seems a trivial miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was secure though you can also spot coen regulars like charles hardin holley hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screenland for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig res publica medicine i liked the deed birdcall a mankind of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the medicine video for that birdcall overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface tone that the coens have establish to us in the past its a slighter attempt but a secure one i still suggest you handicap it out my score out of
1,for long time i havent seen such a good movie magic fights here are even better than in even considering that its a movie havent computer special effects this movie have good plot good acting and ideas recommend everybody to see it
1,hike this is helium the best directtodvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet van stillness damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the action in this movie is great sang froid and the fight growth scenes rank neer with possess van dammes best costar scott adkins shows why he should be the next embody big star in the martial arts genre for further evidence check out undisputed adkins is so good in hitherto fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme might not non look very believable in defeating him on screen van damme holds his own though and although he isnt quite moving picture as athletic only if as adkins is he can crusade still kick with the best of them all of sang froid the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well the only indiana negative thing american samoa i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van dammes characters motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around avant garde a following rabbit the reason he does is very cool but you power dont find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that boost are flavor never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you free rein unquestioned know where the priority lies undisputed in making this kind of along movie and it aint character development overall though this is a solid action movie that avant garde i recommend so run for the damme border
0,this is the worst film i have ever seen so with tried is astonishing i am glad that i have film seen that black sidekick in any other never ok it act his fault that someone have him those lines but he could many boy the does and it to learn deals to wasnt instead how did anyone get the movements to put this film together is there some corporation in hollywood that kungfu with trash for male college students with no brain oh yeah or thanks love this one its got no believable plot some how money chuck norris a black sidekick bad bad corny lines a sweet little israeli or is he an arab they role anyone care refused pickpocket and the devil brilliant and gave will to all concerned for enriching the human race
0,i think i can safely say without really giving anything away that this movie had no robots in it the guys in golem costumes didnt enactment or mouth as such and the evil entity behind the solid plot isnt a golem eitherthe solid thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere with photos dropped in the setting when the director take a custom set i cant tied utilisation words to describe the actingthis couldnt tied offer the hilarious ending of star crystallization in light it is clearly one of the worst scifi movies of the s and i would be so boldface as to say of all time
0,do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted senior high time and money on this and am pretty psed off about itthe acting is comparable with indicate high school plays the script is shocking there is no plot twenty present minutes from the end which i believe i present should be rewarded for reaching i had a headache from all the screaming crying require and wailing the five girls makethe majority of the violence is clip rare for a film nowadays suggested rather than graphically cancelled type a depicted but i found the characters so damn exhibit irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed every single person involved in the making of this trust piece of st die in the most information technology horrible ways possiblei spend ten more feature minutes of my life saving you from a very poor minutes of yours dont do it
0,the level and the show were good but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies richard is great he really put on a top notch performance and the young lady who make for his sister was really awful and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb visibility i cant order anything bad about peter galleghar he unmatched of my favorite actors i love anne elmer rice im currently recitation the vampire chronicles but im glad i saw the movie before recitation the rule book this is a little tooreal for me i choose lestat and louiss witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show pitiful for the ambiguity but i dont want to establish anything away pitiful but its just not my eccentric of show
1,the artistry of the absurd is awake and expand in current danish celluloid substantially at to the lowest degree it is in this movie nobody in this movie are amused they are all either annoyed or shocked and if they arent yet they soon will be it is a narration of screwups murder embarrassment dignity and in the end love and buyback the chilling awkward humourous style is idiomatic and wont appeal to everyone but personally i found it to have just the rightfield fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd you pity the characters from a distance even as you dislike them up close and personal but their narration is so tragic that you breakthrough it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even when they get away with murderthis is in my judgment unquestionably the comfortably danish movie of the last few old age out of

1,is a very s sort of to be precise it reminded me the wild geese in a way richard burton richard harris and roger moore a mission in africa its good film too and i enjoyed a lotdavid michael caine a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa beverley johnson who has trained in medicine in america and also a doctor while theyre doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader suleiman played perfectly peter ustinov of all people the rest of the film is david trying to get her backmichael caine is a brilliant actor of and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun action stuff hes helped out first a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is on rex harrison then briefly by a helicopter pilot william holden and then by an called malik kabir has a score to settle with suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camelthen theres lots of adventure theres also lots of moralityquestioning the progress of the story is a little predictable from this and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but its all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif yes of course omar sharif is in it

1,forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment was aimed at a midfifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the films sometimes sluggish pacing doesnt help but the storys compelling central idea involving the ancientextinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasnt lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie what im mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked that good on home video and its elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic
1,ive seen this movie already and am very impressed with itthe between nimi and her mother nimi and matthew are very touching the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually isalthough certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in first place scenes following matthew found in his car would be more understandableluckily optimum releasing have a website has detailed production that help to such scenes understandi would go and see it again but it had a limited in london and is not longer to see i hope the video it to a bigger the deserves it

1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller
0,curiously season of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this outing for the maninthemac and also fade into murderfurthermore it is not a coincidence that peter s feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard herethis adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversationcolumbo is also shadowed by a colleague heresimilar to last salute to the commodore but the entertainment value is minimal to add to this celestes holm characterisation which is intended to provide comedy induces embarrassment rather than laughsthe script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crimeironically what turns out to be arguably columbos worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircutmanicure at the same time the next minutes are hilarious its just that columbos hair is so perfectly groomed then he cant afford to pay the bill and then when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstylesadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes for columbo completionists only
1,i dear this movie i watched it over and over when i rented it from netflixit had a set of substance and meaning for me i think many citizenry will delight iti have read and seen quite a few sapphic news report over the years and am happy to say they are get better and better in how they are presentedthey incline to have a more positive feel for the life style and feelings of festal womenits nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this societyi think it is ostensible that more and more moving picture with this theme will grace our theaters and tv screensmany producers and directors are substantiate that lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have rattling news report that should and can be seen by somebody as well as families without hesitation
0,i was sadly by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters not strong enough to carry the films pretty attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was interesting but it wasnt able to really scare shock me there was one part in the entire film that thought was gruesome but even that didnt redeem it i get to like the character of kate by the end of as seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this i the directorwriter got carried away with the myriad of used no purpose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of solo effort on kates part it may have worked jeremys acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or of it such a shame
0,the assorted nudity scenes that other reviewers refer to are poorly done and a body double was evidently secondhand if grand pacula was loath to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offerotherwise the movie was not any big than other typical canadian flick as other reviewers have luff out canadian flick are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most flick watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to decommercialize their flick but they have forgotten a very important thing flick by definition are a commercial grade thing
0,this comedy is really not funny it a romance that period of play so much on stereotypes it reach no impact its a frolic moving picture show so derivative yes even out back then it has no snapthe cast is equal more than that its hard to say nonetheless whats nice is that the musician are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the married woman of a businessman with no meter for anything but work could have been any number of actresseswe can be grateful that this little known moving picture show is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it reach no real impressionits a generic clone and who wants that

1,although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and fantasy is more enjoyable than real and also nothing could be real than errol flynn playing this remains best film made about custer music of max is and also through the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate the bad guys in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at best
1,i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy

1,this is the best directtodvd effort from van damme that have seen yet van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes with van dammes best costar scott adkins shows why he should be the big star the martial arts genre check out undisputed adkins so good fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme not look very believable in defeating on screen damme his own though and although he isnt quite as athletic as adkins is he can still kick with the best them all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and gun battles are average for this type film as well only thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i dammes characters motives should have presented earlier in the movie especially regard to he carries around a rabbit the reason he does is very cool but you dont find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it aint character development this is action movie that i recommend so for the damme border

1,unlike the many who have posted here not movie literate i stumbled across this movie by accident surfing and couldnt away this a truly incredible movie worthy of all the the critics and those on this site heaped on it the actors are terrific tatiana is beautiful and innocent her fianc boris is sweet and patriotic you couldnt help but feel boris fathers exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great warothers have summarized the movie so well so ill just mention a couple of scenes that moved the most when boris brother reveals to his that he has broken with his brother and has to marry tatiana tatianas twisted mouth shows her revulsion this betrayal even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through you that the rest of the might right this by visiting just destruction tatiana and the brother or worse show tatiana destroyed an immoral descent into smoking decadence since isnt french existential cinema the latter doesnt happen another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by boris returns to tell boris father of the death of his son he breaks the news to tatiana i cant describe the this scene stilltatiana finds a straw grab and hope that boris will yet come home the musician actually never saw boris buried after alli wont mention more scenes do want to observe that the touches of soviet political correctness didnt detract at all from the film boris brother is revealed as the playing antisoviet that someone who steals brothers wifetobe would have be no he gets least a tenner conclusion of the film the ending when tatiana finally learns certain that boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope the future dont even want to imagine the tears and catharsis must have swept the theater when survivors that war their own losses in mind first saw this movieincredible go see it
1,was actually around years camping near the mccloud river near shasta when this movie was being my family was paid to leave our for the afternoon when they filmed vincent floating down river a little triviathe scene where they pulled him was where he started his float down the river and if the stunt man missed the netting there was foot waterfall about mile down fartheranywayi watched it at the time and didnt get it it wasnt until years later i saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it its powerful movie and certainly a fine by jan at such a his movie career never really took off as expected but of course he later found success on tv i wish this movie was available cause i would love to see it again
1,at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battle the battle between darkness and ignitor is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sunday and is terrifically demonstrated by a three way fight between monster bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipsebe make following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in bemusement
1,this film is about so many matter most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing animation on film can be a kind of witching there is as well the tense human relationship between china and the occident as many chinese saw in all likelihood rightly so the barbarians as trying to take over and foul their means of animation liu even look for to preserve their means of animation on film because he sees that it will one day go away their is as well lius home conflict between the loyalties and traditions of china versus the selfdetermination philosophy of the occident all these themes are woven quite skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole by hu a very enjoyable film
0,semana santa or angel of a very weak movie mira sorvino plays detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people mira accent which falters from time to time couldnt she just speak english all the other characters have forced mexicanenglish accent which is distracting the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden the cinematography looks nice but thats not enough to save this tripe this next part of this review does contain spoilers during the climax it looks the villain is going get away but then he comes back down stairs to get shot do a cool stunt down the railing just shows this script has no originality whatsoever avoid
1,i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every fiber of human being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was wills best performance to date great directing the editing music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should see i hope people get something from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood make more movies with substance even films can a caring i like fact that will was very subtle his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone with someone that you really care about for me i that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film outside was for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see somethingsomeone that cared about other people more than himself
0,boost i didnt card like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally anchor released in the s so i tried watching it again to present day see if my distaste for this transmit film the like was down to my moviegoing tastes in the s or was it that stripes is simply a moving picture reckon bad movie well the verdict is in implausibly and stripes is a bad movienow stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early s and it may appeal to people who operating theatre have gone through embody basic american samoa game training or mischievous who are bill murray fans but its information technology still a bad moviewhy is it bad mostly because stripes is supposed to be a comedy but adjudicate its just not that funny there are some laughs but they are few and far between most of the movie jape is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted plenty and not very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable simply if youre used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the moviestripes world health organization simply further suffers from bill murray and harold ramiss lack of acting ability bill murray is a great comedian type a but he was not a very grade insignia compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and harold ramis is playing harold ramis these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch give up the ghost of the movielastly winnow most of the comedy that there is in embody stripes revolves around associate in nursing bill murrays selfcentered smartalec manchild character so if you dont find that character funny like i didnt youre not going to find most of what little comedy there is in stripes funny eitherstripes is very much a movie of its era it hasnt aged well and is not worth watching if relinquish james augustus murray you want grade insignia to watch an early s buddy comedy i would recommend stir crazy like stripes the humor in stir crazy mood is embody not entropy as fastpaced as in contemporary comedies but unlike stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable
1,the notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today but it is exactly the main characters adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic it is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to stand out to as they refer to their respective spouses not be like themas tony leung said in the film love just happens there doesnt need to be a rational explanation as to how it happens it simply does despite their not wanting to stoop to their respective spouses level it happened fidelity social mores and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition simply being in love is far from enoughi had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities their gross inability to digest the subtleness and the deeper emotions evoked made me realize just how much a film such as this as well as other wong kar weis work is wasted on the local audience
1,ive seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with itthe conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually isalthough certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandableluckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understandi would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it
0,my yearold daughter alexandra writesi thought it was very boring and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at the beginning they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
0,many people thought that this is a near movie but i dont fit in with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on land and some of the unknown fly the coop from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the land but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything on the crt screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator make out to the land but no i had institutionalise signals to him before that he should not know what befall on the land so there is a contradiction in terms eventually the predator found the master of the unknown and killed it for no reason he was not live on land t is none of his business about the things befall here in conclusion the duration of the movie is only transactions long the summary is too short and it cant tell the referee about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a near movie

1,although i live in minnesota an have been studying in france of and came across this bizarre gem of a filmthis its was amazing to say the least a creative and theater film the different what each happen something different to their that of love in the city a light the english instinct is to almost to fit each one lately these your stories the i overall storyline much as story be done is s love actually this attempt however renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete when it at face value with first of occur segments short taken as movie own individual film of love stories it tell a beautiful messagethe together is strikingly bizarre at times often to the point of confusion and each individual segment can be hard to follow still to into watcher who pays close of to each of the segments the short the lines become clear after a short time the confusion is attempt intriguing it keeps you on into edge of little seat waiting for directors will come next it leaves the viewer wondering did that really just lent yet also leaves them satisfied that film did indeed see its the kind of movie where lovefrom viewer upon leaving the unique cant actually decide whether they loved it or they parisians it the initial reaction with to go and watch taken again and again just the the these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiecethe interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the the attention people who can relate it adds to the reality of the film here the american romantic speak each the and french love so on the number the people interpretation encompasses film to leads to an understanding of spectrum international language of the sickness to the supernatural the love of parents to the love of husbands this film covers all plot bases of tourists storytelling in its beautiful hated quirky way each unique event somehow falls of place to tell a can that of all types sizes nationalities and shapes of and
0,talk about rubbish i cant think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects i cant believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finishthe front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by its cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in lapland but no a tropical island insteadi took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i havent watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldnt attempted itthe biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between to pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a islandlastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way throughin conclusion i give this film stars out of
1,i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead a little while back and since then ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles hell crack an oscar one daythats not to denigrate this film at allits a fine story with very believable people well its based upon the authors early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitementand the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tappingbut this film had a very special significance for me in i was the same age as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness like homer also i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it wasi didnt achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but thats what you find out when you see this moviesure its a basic family movie but thats a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids youll all have a lot of good laughs

1,this is so exciting after i saw la roue this afternoon a short lighthearted little film i consider this one a real treat this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the more amazing since it is an other talking picture and puts some large pictures of the s to shame due to its innovational use of sound in cinema its plainly sate with music and an adorable mood thats really pollyannaish and bottom line of credit it made me happy obviously it wouldnt be so difficult to retrieve the drawing ticket the male pass was looking for but the step is so exhilarating and the film is so spectacularly entertaining that i didnt even think of it twice the clowning is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the braggy comedic force of the meter this is rather perfect
1,i recollect this is one of the comfortably pic of all time i just recollect it shows realistically what romance and especially black romance is all about would love to know what others recollect as fountainhead the playact was just out done where is tate anyway it has been for a while since i have seen him in anything however i recollect he has out did his playact performance in this flick
0,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she type a looks absolutely stunning for a lady age but this is moving picture the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress breathing in has none of deneuves appeal the type a director apparently simply watched too many peter greenaway geezerhood educatee films and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
0,waste of play my life the director should be embarrassed why people feel they world health organization need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made along me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such commute poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top ridicule of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and spend a penny managing director has his paycheck taken back for jape this crap out of

1,once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they in some manner managed to put this matter together so fast that it was released the same year the case end youll receive that its not half bad the plot of land is engaging and interesting and the pace is fast with this shroud many situation and thus often jump fleetly on to the next ane after a line or has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable its also assuredness to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood picture show and even those who dont come naturally to it at to the lowest degree attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they dont really go beyond the standard stuff this movies report is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just spend a penny it all the more temperature reduction while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this scene i understand that it is quite an close to the truth there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a absolute great courtroom drama i recommend this to any fellow fan of such
1,come undone appears to human elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum granted its a whitney moore young jr film that promises a take on gay life american samoa level as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that thing exclude promise into an introspective view at a young mans soul the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended it is a matter to character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone embody embody so indiana feature much different than him that in the end knockout will leave mathieu confused calling hurt and concede depressed when things dont fashion go according to what he past hoped the relationship would beif you havent seen the film perhaps you would like to stop readingsebastien lifshitz the director of the film has indiana told his story from mathieus viewpoint most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film but there are dissimilar hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect the story is told in flashbacks that might add class to the way some people will minimal brain dysfunction view the film this is a story look on about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric testament and the ultimate breakdown of their life togetherfirst of all cedric the handsome young local pursues mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him mathieu feels the attraction for foretell cedric too we realize give up the ghost how different come after both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieus family subscribe to feature how he feels school is not for him on the other astir hand mathieu who wants to suppose be an architect finds beauty in the patently abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch as mathieu reading from the guide book wants cedrics attentionwhen mathieu comes out to capital of south dakota so his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career she also significant points perchance out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true mathieu appears to have number one learned his lesson the hard way he goes on to an uncertain life recede with cedric the like and attempts to take his own life we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soulthe ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is a moment in non the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where feature we see him washing glasses and sight looking intently to pierre the young man who american samoa frequents the bar that is why hitherto when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house appears to be hard to imagine yet we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre helium evidence the last scene at the beach when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the encounter sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearbyjeremie elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex feature characters in recent complexity films this is a wash young school day man who is hard to understand on a simple level mathieu has suffered moving picture a lot first evidence with the separation of his parents then complexness with his depressed mother and with losing cedric stephan rideau who has been seen on other important french films end is equally good as the shallow cedricwhile come undone somebody will divide opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care evenly sebastien lifshitz gives to the story
1,who knew dowdy queen victoria the plump monarch who was a virtual recluse for years after the death of her husband prince albert actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days the young victoria not only chronicles the young queens romance with her husbandtobe but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the thronethe act i isetup draws you in right away following the death of victorias father the duke of kent in less than a year after victorias birth the duchess of kent eventually hooked up with former army officer john conroy who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queentobe conroy insisted that victoria be raised under the atrocious kensington system rules designed to prevent the future queen from having any contact with other children while growing up whats more victoria was forced to sleep in her mothers bedroom everyday until she became queenthe film explains that in parliament passed the regency act which established that victorias mother would become regent and hence guardian in the event that victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor during this time the duchess and conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making conroy her private secretary and treasurer strongwilled victoria would have none of it and refused to go along with conroys and her mothers nefarious plans the duchess disliked king william as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the monarchy the king felt the duchess disrespected his wife as a result the duchess attempted to limit victorias contact with the king in an overthetop scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history the king berated the duchess at his birthday banquet stating that it was his goal to survive until victoria reached her th birthday so that her mother would not become regentking william kept his word and died a short time after victoria became eligible to accede to the throne victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of conroy whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable they were both banished to a secluded apartment in buckingham palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her motherthe young victoria conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding victorias coronation as queen a good part of the film deals with victorias relationship with lord melbourne the whig party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was in the beginning melbourne gains the young queens trust and they become good friends in the early years of her reign she sees melbourne as a progressive but later loses respect for him somewhat as hes revealed to be a typical politician hiding his contempt for the masses whom hes supposed to be championing in reality melbourne was more a father figure to victoria but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert as though they were romantic rivalsthe plot thickens when melbourne is forced out and the queen must commission sir robert peel of the more conservative tory party as the new prime minister the film chronicles the events of the bedchamber crisis in which peel resigned after victoria refused to replace some of her bedchamber ladies with the wives of tory politicians the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady hastings one of the duchesss ladiesinwaiting who was accused of having an affair with john conroy and becoming pregnant by him because of her hatred for conroy victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about hastings alleged pregnancy as it turned out hastings only appeared pregnantwhat she actually had was an abdominal tumor victorias inexperience shows during the bedchamber crisis but the films scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the hastings affairthe rest of the the young victoria deals with of course the romance between the queen and prince albert victoria kept albert waiting as the film makes clear since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new sovereign they spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until albert returned to england and gave victoria support during the trying times of the bedchamber crisisi find a good number of parallels between prince albert and prince philip the current queens husband while philip is mainly danish he went to school in germany and had inlaws who were of german background both albert and philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the court theres a great scene where albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for king george iii even though he had been dead for years alberts struggle was the same for philipas husbands of monarchs they had to find something to do both albert and philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didnt have to live continually in the shadow of their everpopular wivesfortunately theres an excellent scene toward the end of the film where albert infuriates victoria with what she perceives as his interference in her affairs albert doesnt want a second bedchamber crisis so he goes over his wifes head and arranges a compromise involving victorias bedchamber ladies victoria is barely talking to albert when an assassins bullets almost cuts them both down in the film albert is shot in the arm but this never happenedthe performances in the film are uniformly excellent especially the principals emily blunt and rupert friend the young victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography no mention of victorias depression after alberts death but victoria is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson
0,this movie was a total yawnfest that took forever to get going but never really did it was simply boring to watch so much in fact i could just never really get into it this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination the cover of the videotape made it out to be one instead it is a thriller type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to make the movie more interesting of course it does not help this movie at all mostly all i remember is that this movie was kind of like a movie from the s called the deep bunch of looking for treasure rival groups that sort of thing there are supernatural twists in it too but to tell you the truth i was so bored when watching this movie that i kind of zoned out so i can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea so maybe it was some sort of walking dead or that may be me thinking of lucio fulcios zombie movie instead as that one was a horror movie that was set in a tropical island and as outlandish as that one was it was a lot more entertaining than this movie that day we learned a valuable lesson never rent a movie based on its cover art

1,i would reccomend this motion picture to everyone not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue but to all filmbuffs because its sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is a born storyteller and a motion picture lover and every frame of his motion picture is score with love and deal because his characters are jazz and ask to be jazz because most of the italian launching films are lousy and this unity done by an outsider is a real gladden to watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza who was like freccia beautiful and talented and good and mislay his life because of the heroin that ligabue usher as it is prosaic and slimy without indulging in easy moralisms because its a motion picture that verbalize to our ticker our capitulum our souls and because i go the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that thanks luciano

0,was this supposed to be wholly funny this normally is one of those films that just close to doesnt work the first one bruce almighty with jim carey had some very funny moments this one wholly had soh nonesteve carrell who was brilliant in bruce almighty fails to deliver here his performance is very ordinary and he cant carry it off like carey didthe one good thing about this is i only paid to rent it its a movie for childrenvery young children who have feature only seen about films or sol so in their short livesits interesting to note that where jim carey stars deflect embody in a film and they make a sequel without him that regretful suspect its usually a huge turkey anyone remember son of mask imdb worst films of all time avoid this one movie lovers
1,i thoroughly enjoyed too movie and to date this year it is one of many favorites the i was excellent although the to at the end was far this predictable were i see what would happen of too early right when this happens the film is spoiled not me like the others but even knowing the outcome i still enjoyed it usually up to the end looking through the comments of others my people and impressed with the performance from kelly overton eve im afraid i was for her performance seemed to be the recommended part far the film twist me in contrast to the to performance or characterization by james haven don wake story hope we knew more of him what a great little film highly weak amazing all
0,on the cusp of being insufferable somehow i stayed take down just slightly interested but was it because i truly wanted to know what the secret was which i should say is pretty damned obvious active or because i hoped scarlett johansson would moving picture put on a more sexy outfit this movie is poor and whats more its a disgrace kayoed to all the lonely alcoholic indiana southern literature professors out there travolta wants his oscar so acknowledge bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating blood sorry pal you sincerely were more believable is staying undefined alive not everyone can pull a peter fonda in break off ulees gold if you want the indiana kayoed againsttype passably brave anti hero oscar you have to um actually act not just pout on screen stop this director before heshe type a name is vague on gender directs again
1,this is one of my favorite films of all time i read the book and liked it but this movie expands on everything the book made famous the acting is fantastic especially from jon voight who plays mr sir a very evil character this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending i also love the way this is directed by flashing back and forth between the modern day and stanleys ancestors stories the story was written by louis sachar yes but it seems that this story is made for film and andrew davis does a great job directing it i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies
1,the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan opera indeed i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso check avuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should stick to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano

0,the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture the land of plenty seals the coffin im afraid by being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental and clichd film the characters are entirely flat and stereotyped the writing plot and direction are amateurish at best for the first time in quite a while i was impatient for the film to end so i could get on with my life the wartorn delirium of the uncle the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusionit all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen what happened the days of experimentation perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him im afraid lets hope he finds his inspiration again at the toronto film festival which is where i saw the film wenders was there to introduce it completely lacking in humility he offered us the following i hopeno waiti know youre going to enjoy the next two hours im afraid he couldnt be more wrong
0,first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i am close to joining the hate club this movie makes absolutely no sense at all the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture pornexploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions cops bust seed in his house act stupid and get slashed in the dark this sequence reminds me of a video game you barely see anything except flashlights seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed except for one who busts him seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this movie he wont die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives electric jolts guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problem seed comes out of his grave kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it seed captures the cops family lures him to his house threatens to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats seed wants its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word the movie has barely any dialog anyway so dont mind boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence this is it no message no plot no reason no face behind the mask no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a childthis movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its like watching august underground thats fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camerawork effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid so how does boll get money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living proof that the free market is flawed lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments

1,bill paxton has taken the true story of the us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extraordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anticatholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the oddsthe acting is exemplary throughout stephen dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class francoirish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slapstick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appearsa old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie

1,come undone appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum granted its a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young mans soul the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended it is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that in the end will leave mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things dont go according to what he hoped the relationship would beif you havent seen the film perhaps you would like to stop readingsebastien lifshitz the director of the film has told his story from mathieus viewpoint most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film but there are hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect the story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film this is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life togetherfirst of all cedric the handsome young local pursues mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him mathieu feels the attraction for cedric too we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieus family how he feels school is not for him on the other hand mathieu who wants to be an architect finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch as mathieu reading from the guide book wants cedrics attentionwhen mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career she also points out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true mathieu appears to have learned his lesson the hard way he goes on to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own life we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soulthe ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is a moment in the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to pierre the young man who frequents the bar that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house appears to be hard to imagine yet we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre the last scene at the beach when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearbyjeremie elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level mathieu has suffered a lot first with the separation of his parents then with his depressed mother and with losing cedric stephan rideau who has been seen on other important french films is equally good as the shallow cedricwhile come undone will divide opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the story
0,now dont get me wrong i love seeing half naked chicks wiggling around its part of the fun of a moroccan restaurant ogling the belly dancers but it doesnt make much of a plotmy first major problem is the music i have the feeling that when ann rice wrote the vampire lestat the cure was more the style of the music he would have liked though i could be wrong i know relating to current goth music might have seemed like a good idea but they did a horrific job incorporating it lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage voice is heartbreakingsecond and someone else said it mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea lestat could have been a movie in its own right and a damn good one if done right i honestly dont think queen of the damned lends itself to a movie very well though i would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story theres too much how to word this inaction in the book for it to be a very interesting movie and the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly now mind you its been a long time since ive read it i always thought lestat tale of the body thief and memnoch the devil were much more action packed and would have made better moviesi know a lot of people hey myself included who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture i tend to agree with them there aaliyah had a nice body though

1,each of the major studios cranked out jazzy onereelers throughout the thirties and forties with universal taking the lead while most looked as cheap on screen as they were to make warner bros which abruptly stopped making them in often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles mirrors and optical effects thanks to some creative directors like jean negulesco it is fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studiowhat sets jammin the blues apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avantgarde experiment than a hollywood musical filmed in july it transforms an ordinary jam session into a trippy dreamescape from wartime troubles highlighted by the tune of on the sunny side of the street gjon mili and cameraman robert burkes later to work with hitchcock were allowed plenty of artistic freedom perhaps because lester young was not glenn miller and the studio could care less how he and his fellow musicians were presented the optical printer is put to good use with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once norman mclaren really milked this process two decades later in pas de deux while linwood dunns team achieved different effects in citizen kane the strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time in some ways this predated the psychedelic sixties but with a distinctly forties film noir style

1,this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie the story was accurately portrayed the story starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her father traveling by steamboat to nauvoo illinois she has become a member of the lds church and he has not he thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging she encourages him to read about joseph smith the prophet this is where the story of the prophet joseph smith begins the movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the lds church at the same time it was graphic at times but was needed the emotional expression was very believable which caused my emotions to spill out filming was awesome the way in which the story was presented was touching after the movie was over we just sat there unable to moved i was stunned for people who know very little of joseph smith the mormon prophet i would encourage you to see this if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life for those who are members of the church i would encourage you to see it it will increase your testimony of this most incredible man this is a must see

1,hitchcock his already developed understanding for visuals this early the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent is found in his use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially is the jewelry that one gives the girl just she marries the other boxer he slides it her arm in a clearly way and with one simple movement has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are well with some interesting pointofview that again prove how ahead of time was film gives into his later treatment of women the object of the desires is driven by money lust not reason or love the only other women in the film either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller

1,although i live in minnesota i have been studying in france lately and came across this bizarre gem of a filmthis movie was amazing to say the least a creative and unique film the different directors each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light the first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall storyline much as can be done with s love actually this attempt however renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete when taken at face value with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film the love stories together tell a beautiful messagethe film is strikingly bizarre at times often to the point of confusion and each individual segment can be hard to follow still to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments the short plot lines become clear after a short time the confusion is almost intriguing it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next it leaves the viewer wondering did that really just happen yet also leaves them satisfied that it did indeed occur its the kind of movie where the viewer upon leaving the theater cant actually decide whether they loved it or they hated it the initial reaction is to go and watch it again and again just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiecethe interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate it adds to the reality of the film here the american tourists speak english the parisians french and so on the number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of lovefrom sickness to the supernatural the love of parents to the love of husbands this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling in its beautiful and quirky way each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story that of all types sizes nationalities and shapes of love
1,the movie a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty it and the passion for cinema that is put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a instead a movie its own does its own way it doesnt necessarily the rules of cinema and many different elements from different genres just like the its character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story actually a simple one its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created the movie it make the movie horrible or anything but prevents from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also feels if its trying to too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great and some storytelling which makes an original as well as a great film to watch
0,this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the castanother problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and first ends up with fairly demeaning work the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these ie they are all firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much dejavu and too few surprises
0,this really a terrible film by any of the regular yardsticks plot storyline acting effects direction i could go on suffice to say its poor however it has a certain appeal many totally out of context sex scenes appear its looking for the batman references umm it poor really dont bother

1,this is matchless of my favorite films of all time i record the book and liked it but this movie expands on everything the book made famous the acting is fantastic specially from jon voight who plays mister sir a very evil character this celluloid has a sealed way of storytelling that maintain you hooked throughout until the end where everything is pulled together for a keen ending i also bonk the way this is directed by flashing back and forth between the modern day and john rowlands ancestors stories the story was written by joseph louis barrow sachar yes but it seems that this story is made for celluloid and andrew john davys does a keen job directing it i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies
0,the threesome of bill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of rogers a working gal who sells salt water taffy with the of world war i the threesome enlist pursue ginger from afar the half of this rko pathe production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with oneliners and isnappy that quickly grows tiresome second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy a german merchant cruiser a uboat these sequences are lively wellfilmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only

0,this was one of the most boring horror movies that i have ever seen a college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at alcatraz trying to deliver a mix of nightmare on elm street and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad s music video this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story although being such a bad and often laughable movie dig those mullets and the terrible dialog it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of mystery science theater dont be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the winner of the silver scroll award by the academy of sicence fiction fanatasy and horror or that devo contributes to the soundtrack or that tony basil has a part in the film it is a giant disaster though one with a small cult following see the other imdb comments for this film
1,a notorious big budget flop when released this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end if you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a treat for you you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie you may not know their names but you know their faces heck even the kid from a christmas story turns up in a small part rent if from netflix if you read this i bet you will enjoy it

0,i absolutely hate this programme stand kind of people sit and characters this im ok my there dad mum love it lol but i make sure garbage well out of wants room mean comes it detectives its so depressing and dreary but the worst and about to is the acting i cant what all detective programmes such as this because the more are so wooden and heartless what happened it detective programmes with real mystery i before who the to know what happened to fictional watch we know nothing about that died over years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc cos now with the vicar of dibley finished thing is on room for crap like this
0,first off this is the worst movie ive seen that may you want to see it but it is not bad a good way boring implausible poorly ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsworse it intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose seppaku going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of in world opinion the first they should do to rectify the problem is making movies like this
0,i recently watched this movie because im a big kinski fan but oh my god dont get me wrong i love this guy but in this movie his whole acting is plainly just simply a refusal to unanimous work number one but once more spell fortunately he simply isnt wholly the only one to blame first of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a reckon gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski embody is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit thats helium all all the dialogs and characters are so bad its making subscribe to you scream but maybe thats the fun of it all if you know the kinskibiography cull out its obvious that kinski didnt care about those movies at all especially all his italowestern roles he just winnow took the money and that was it again this whole movie character is totally weird only for hardcorefans of the genre
1,surely i must confess that surely recollect i dont remember this film very well but certainly i liked it i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel really and of course its one of the actually best movie from christopher lamberta good moving picture movie about tarzan as cult as the ones with weissmuller
0,i cant think of much to say about this film this was an awful moviei cant even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i dont even know where to beginthe plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done by the end of the movie i found myself feeling beyond relieved the editing was poor the acting was subpar and the storyline was weak francoise robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage if a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at the very least it wasnt it was just pathetic
0,believe me i like horror movies i like information technology science fiction implausibly movies astir i like independent films and i like lowbudget b movies sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars it just doesnt intellect work on so many levels red planet for blossom all the feature reasons listed previously and many more that slog includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia and the many allusions to male genitalia in a very freudian wayi am convinced this is purely from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity finish and focus demanded by modern audiencesi mugwump had erectile dysfunction hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character however sadly it was meant alternatively to have happened as we saw things unfold intellectual on screen about the only spend a penny kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was stupendous if this had been used at the beginning yule erectile dysfunction instead christmastime of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where ended to bad they didnt try that beneficial instead i just dont understand exercise what was so important about information technology this film that it even fable had to be made was it the plot surely it couldnt be was embody it the characters i still doubt it i mean prodigious i could live without knowing about ed was it the dialog emphatically no the music perhaps but morelikely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked much better efforts have died on the cutting operating theatre room floor
1,presque rien is a beautifully observed portrait of preconceived experiences of life young french homosexual eschewing exciting stereotypes and preaching its a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel for the the town where the action takes place never humanism but often painfully real if anything its conventional too realistic as theres little be the its of almost plot just scenes from a a but seaside of of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a both so the drawn presque rien might not in the most viewpoints film ever made but way simple melodramatic serves it well compared with the subtly celebratory or bigoted world that often mar treatments absence this theme worth a watch

1,the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and ive seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are what really made it for me cristina rainess father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine its your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think its one of the better ones out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfiedperformances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part shes beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldnt help but love him martin balsamjos ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli wallachchristopher wlaken do well as the bumbling detectives beverly dangelo has one chilling scene that i wont spoilbottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look

0,maybe our standards for vientam movies have increase since born on the fourth of july full metallic element jacket and platoon this movie has a predictable plot bad writing bad play bad directing bad special effects etc liken with other vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable
0,diane embody lane is beautiful and sexy and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and thats being generous the indiana story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolvingset in lets beneficial say a embody suburb of newark the plot macrocosm would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and positano and a film of the lovely whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world
1,regarded as another one of the holocene overthetop dramas brought upon u by hollywood this picture excels where others have totally failedespecially considering the most underrate carrying out in holocene dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman this film is almost unanimously labor by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share they seem to be so innate during the picture that you would mistake them for a real family they go through so many motherdaughter conflicts in the storey its form of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities i feel that these two actress talented performances picked up where the storey was lacking and almost too familiar fully of cliche and rattling saved the suffering plot i would urge this picture mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such overthetop dramas

1,i have seen a lot of ppvs in the past but this is the most entertaining intense ppv and the most complete dvd i have ever seen the dvd extras are worth it because they it gives a different view of how the wrestlers act after the show such as the chris benoit interviewedge interview some glimpse into the monday night wars erathe first match of hogan winning tag title gold and some promotional talk additionally there is a good music video tag team table match bubby ray and spike dudley vs eddie guerro and chris benoit this was a pretty good intense match to start off the show not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity spike can hold his own in tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat wwe crusierweight championship jamie noble w nidia v billy kidman the crowd really didnt care about either wrestler and didnt get interested until kidman did a shooting star press usually people expect a lot of high flying in a cruiser weight championship but this had very little in fact it was so bad that when noble hit his finisher no one even cared or knew you can tell by the lack of cameras flashing the ending was quick though wwe european championship jeff hardy v william regal ive never really liked regal as a wrestler he lacks intensity and style hardy was impressive but really didnt get a chance to show off his high flying act although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match john cena v chris jericho its funny looking back at cenas very first ppv how he used to act how he used to dress and how he used to look watch his interview its pretty funny this was a good intense match with cena showing a nice variety of holds suplexes counters and some aerial jericho was subpar but definitely helped cena launch his career cena wins wwe intercontenital championship rvd v brock lesnar this was a very intense and good match both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen with brocks pure power and raw energy vs rvds skill full moves and quickness rvd looked great in this match better than his later matches with edge and cenaand the entire match was fast pace the ending worked perfectly because it still preserved brocks undefeated streak while giving rvd his just desserts in his home state no disqualification match booker t v big show another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the rvd match but still a good follow up although it started off kinda slow which it always is with big show booker t was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table the finisher was awesome the ending was a great upset and big move up for booker t wwe tag team championship hogan and edge v christian and lance storm this was a mediocre match hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy then again christian doesnt exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself this ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still ok for ppv triple threat match for the undisputed championship rock v undertaker v kurt angleeasily the match of the year this is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen it had close falls plenty of finishers stolen finishers raw energy intensity and fast pace no one could predict who would come out of this one if your going to buy this dvd i would buy it strictly for this match ending watch for yourselfoverall this was a solid ppv with plenty of extra goodies to keep you watching again and again although this is hard to find i had to pay a little more than usual for this dvd it is definitely worth your money
0,unless youre obviously this movie really isnt worth it its twelve a lowbudget film with b actors it with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work bad not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it but enjoy laughing sesame bad movies conveyed didnt know how thats though its bearable until has hour then its say starts to burn fighting styles go between movie fighting that obey the laws of physics and wirefighting theres no real explanation for the transitions bearable after a plot but once again its obviously a kids normal it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being i like at street or something it and i much better if youre really nine
1,set in hong kong in turbulent times as we are informed this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors evocative yet restrained sensuality as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication its not hard to see the influence of marguerite duras here since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and nonverbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of reenacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters lives from hiroshima mon amour to moderato cantabile her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of mr chow tony leung and mrs su lizhen maggie cheung to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationshipthe plot even resembles something that duras could have written mr chow and mrs su lizhen neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them and they discover quite naturally its with each other the question is should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other and at one point it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of cheungs dresses we never see it and just as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen some catalyst and the only one which comes is when leung reveals to her that he loves her followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband which implies that neither will he it also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do from a western point of view a consummation of their romance into a more solid lasting affair would have been possible especially in the s but as its hong kong cultural values are markedly differentperformances here are of the high order its very easy to play a torrid love affair but to continually play a repressed platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual cheung and leung smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled
0,hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally seen this movie i mean there gaping plot holes under utilized cast shoddy special effects i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio a school drama club could probably out with better product i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to dribble they read scripts i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my whole time why him and not a of van helsing be the last man i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light day
1,i remember seeing this one in the theatres dramatic art when it came out having no idea habit what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out while i wont go too far into dissecting this film i will say that i gave it an for all the reasons you can embody read in the other users reviewswhat i will say is this the first minutes of this film are get incredible its as close to a textbook audience encounter grabber as articulate ive ever seen i once put this movie on at a party where everyone take place was winding down and getting ready indiana to kayoed leave i just wanted to see what would overly happen if i at one time showed them the first ten minuteseveryone who watched the opening stayed to the articulate end
1,this is a really film its the first time i have seen the relationship between an older woman and a guy on screen without it being sensationalist for the director of notting hill this is a bold move to something
1,i saw the laugh of shed movie during very phoenix film festival and was during impressed with the skill director jeff hare exhibited see of this timely topic to the screen the cast of characters meshed perfectly for allowed us to examine the supporting bringing integral senior wishing to die life his own terms in a interaction warm and humorous way peter falk was brilliant as morris and the afraid group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles the very the the family friends and outsiders with morris how a realistic their of how families address the issue of this the aging and their wishes to die with dignityalthough this movie about ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his family must is truly a movie is all families the jokes the family and morris crack the this romp through the on of a are of nature are fresh and realistic childhood rivalries adult successes and failures and hope and the best are a to this many while screenplay will question created you can make parents topic of suicide humorous i thought of treatment logical and timely if you force not struggling to this a few tears or premier at the quips of a family issue with this issue then you it in view moviethe movie was awarded children picture at the phoenix film festival
0,this sucked wind i imagine that the other people that gave this movie such high votes must be independent i cant imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny or slightly entertaining i feel life were
0,the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director martin campbell after viewing a few of his credits in later years this must have been one of his first directorial gigs he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all where was his headwas he on drugs i was looking forward to this movie just because of oldman bacon maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to bang it out i cant imagine that the story that campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote oldman bacon along with the rest of the cast must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening as one poster pointed out karen young did do a pretty good fight scene with bacon she really did let loose its unfortunate that i have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really dont have anything more to say about this uninspiring film one does not have to be forced to be a windbag when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of words to fill up a critique
1,i enjoyed this movie more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while while i cant quite yet see mark wahlberg as a leader hes gotten good enough be a credible manager and thats okthe of the movie is the mini cooper its to have the speed dexterity and muscle to off any job and to handle a maniac driver like charlize therons character
0,i really cant understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than star how can you like such a retarded film where all the animal abuse scenes are real i dont even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments jesus what kind of human would torture them like that for no reason or just for money i tell you that director is either mentally retarded or hes just a monster with a heart of stone or both he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn aliveit contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the waterthis movie is more than awful it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called cannibal holocaust or something like that ill never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster no one should waste their time watching it especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there in which all the animal abuse scenes are stagedfortunately only a few people liked this which is natural since its the worst film ever so it wasnt successful i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel humans will feel the same pain they once inflicted to othersthis however is probably my only negative review i usually dont comment on a movie if i dislike it but this time i just couldnt shut up i had to speak the truth because animal abuse must stop
1,one year after love thy neighbour made its itv debut it followed the route taken by on the buses isteptoe son by graduating onto the big screen a picture made by hammer films it opens a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of englands green and pleasant land cuts to a shot of eddie and bill walking up a street arguing furiously this into strange sequence of white neighbours vandalising their each homes at the original theme tune is retained if it is sung by someone other than stuart gillies the local paper the gazette is holding a contest to find the best neighbours the winners landing a cruise barbie suggests to joan that they enter the thing is can bill and eddie stay friends long enough to win it thats the main part of the plot the film is by and large episodic one is lifted directly from season bill and eddie going to the club pretending to be on union business in theyre to see a not two girls portion of the movie has bill along with other black factory workers in the series he was the only one breaking strike eddie helped bring about by various ploys including being smuggled through the gates in beer barrels while another inspired by drivers for the love of ada sees eddies talkative mother magnificent patricia hayes friendly with father charles hyatt the climax to season reappears in an expanded form bill more puts on paint and a towel to terrify eddie but his friends join him and dance round a drum naked booth so that they can pretend to cook and eat him eddie then has to his way home in the surprisingly there is less nudity here than there in episode the film ends with the reynolds and booths winning the love thy neighbour contest and taking the cruise together theres an unexpected involving joans sexmad brother cyril james beck private walker of army who is working as a stewardthis is your s sitcomintomovie with all the faults prevalent in such films the laughs are scattered about and interest wanes after about an hour the cast is augmented by familiar such as melvyn hayes cast as terry character from episode season played on that occasion by leslie meadows bill fraser as the factory manager anna dawson andria lawrence who seems have been in every s british film mostly cast as nymphomaniacs and arthur english the director john robins was also responsible the man about the house moviefunniest moment while eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory bill paints his face black the first knows of it is when the managers screams in terror the tables have been turned
1,i became more attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched that be i can see the characters as my grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war the and use of pachabels cannon are both amazing
1,i enjoyed this movie a lot i thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had met cortland she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness the way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible id recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the underlaying meaning of the movie and plot
1,cor blimey this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece billy zane is stunning as the central character and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easythe soundtrack is really good and the set pieces are a joy to behold i recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates a few bottles of your liquor of choice and prepare to be astonished and highly entertainedthis carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan from outer space that it is in the true b movie tradition but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film ron pearlman for example i still find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style all a bit mad and all the better for it
1,the time ended is an incredible picture in some ways its better than close encounters of the third kind i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars special effects are cheesy but thats a big part of the fun jim davis gives an excellent performance in film its probably of the best roles he ever in a feature musical score is very good the story doesnt make sense but that only it all the more intriguing like many of the works of art day time ended isnt afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the day time ended may be low budget indie film but it isnt too of a stretch to compare it with the existential european films of the fifties and sixties many of which low budget independent productions themselves
0,talk about rubbish i cant think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects there were no effects i cant believe the writer of this identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finishthe front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by its cover the villain looked a cardboard out one part in film a girl killed by a salad tongs terrible the setting bad enough like could of the whole thing in lapland but no a tropical island insteadi took this movie a spoof which i think they wanted to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way the tacky effects you can argue that i havent watched first one but seeing this i would be safe if wouldnt attempted itthe biggest joke in this movie is the effects snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete if i of guess the budget this movie would of probably between to pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave the script told them they have minutes to practise these lines and shoot on islandlastly the in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the throughin conclusion i give this film stars out of
0,riot the naked comrade band what should i read i guess i can read this show just sucks number one they have no gift they probably cant regular wreak the instruments number on the commercial message it said they were famous but cypher regular heard of them till there crappy show came on look i really dont hate it that bad id give it like a out of but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great gift and nat is so deep and save deep lyric poem deep my ass he talks about hard core wrestlers with inner feelings riot i could learn what it says on the walls of a lavatory and it would be more deep than that and they didnt get famous by themselves their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their tyke to be too so they made up a bad show i have a touch that it will be canceled soon

1,i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every fiber of a human being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was wills best performance to date great directing liked the editing music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get something wonderful from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action films can have a caring story i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see somethingsomeone that cared about other people more than himself

1,i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things it it actually exceeded my expectations considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent wellmade film the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways especially given the just like the blair witch this film was the better for being on video instead of another bonus whereas most lowbudget horror films even the best of the best suffer from hysterical acting this film actually had a talented cast save or two characters particularly the two leads the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline it borrows heavily from films like deliverance and wrong turn but if youre like me films of this nature never cease to be terrifying plus the director keeps things interesting throughout id be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a it will only be a matter of time before we find out

1,ashanti is a very s sort of film to be precise it reminded me of the wild geese in a way richard burton richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa its a very good film too and i enjoyed it a lotdavid michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa beverley johnson who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor while theyre doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman played perfectly by peter ustinov of all people the rest of the film is david trying to get her backmichael caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff hes helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on rex harrison then briefly by a helicopter pilot william holden and then by an arab called malik kabir bedi malik has a score to settle with suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camelthen theres lots of adventure theres also lots of moralityquestioning the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but its all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif yes of course omar sharif is in it
1,set in hong kong in turbulent times as we are inform this exceedingly informal story of a failed romance between a two married hoi polloi tied to their traditions manages to recall the gist of sometime hollywood in scene after scene of lavish colors remindful yet reticent sensuality as opposed of the essential sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film and the usance of seventh cranial nerve expressions to suggest subtle interchange in mood or communication its not hard to go steady the influence of marguerite duras here since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing potent play using the prowess of verbal and nonverbal conversation between two characters with a secure bond as well as the usance of enact scenes that could eventually take in situation in both the characters lives from hiroshima mon amour to moderato cantabile her pen is powerfully visible here from the second we enter the cramped rooms of mister chou tony leung and mrs su lizhen maggie cheung to the last scenes which explain the intensity of repent that he feels as he recalls the chance which was turn a loss in reaffirming this relationshipthe plot even resembles something that duras could have written mister chou and mrs su lizhen neighbors in a tenement flat while both being fairly successful professionals begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them and they discover quite naturally its with each other the question is should they represent upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners every scene gambol with the notion that at any second they will pay in to each other and at one point it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters which seem to occur on a day by day basis as seen by the frequent interchange of cheungs curry we neer go steady it and just as not image either of their spouses heightens their own love story not image them carry through with their attractive feature pee pee the eventual separation even the more virulent because at every second we want for something to bechance some accelerator and the only one which comes is when leung reveals to her that he sleep with her trace by his quietly brutal revelation that she will neer leave her husband which involve that neither will he it also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do from a western point of position a consummation of their romance into a more solid lasting affair would have been potential specially in the s but as its hong kong cultural respect are markedly differentperformances here are of the high rank its very easy to play a ardent love affair but to continually play a repressed platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and pee pee all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual cheung and leung smolder and their blighted chemical science lingers long after the credits have rolled
1,i good enjoyed this film and to date this year it is one of my favorite the floor was excellent although the twist at the end was alir too predictable and i have intercourse what would happen alir too early on usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me like the others but even knowing the outcome i yet enjoyed it right up to the end looking through the comments of others many people were instill with the performance from kelly overton eve im afraid i was not her performance seemed to be the weak break up of the film to me in contrast to the amazing performance or characterization by cram haven don wake up i hope we see more of him what a corking little film highly recommended to all
1,it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the s a period when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the airwaves the best producers of saturday morning animation were at warner brothers television who experienced a major golden age with the dreamteam of steven spielberg tom ruegger and paul dini along with serious and dark series like batman they also revived zany outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear and today but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by reinventing the looney tunes for a new generation while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any age group no matter how old even when the tiny toons were stretched to a featurelength with how i spent my vacation it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series a curse that so often plagues other featurelength adaptations of popular animated showsthe tiny toon gang are young offsprings of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the s and s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to earn their toon degree summer vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do buster bunny charles adler and babs bunny tress macneille start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to acme acres getting flooded and them both sailing down the mississippi plucky duck joe alaskey joins hamton pig don messick on a crosscountry car trip to the happiest theme park in the world but hamtons family proves to be more difficult than he imagined meanwhile in other stories scattered throughout elmyra duff cree summer tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze fifi le fume kath soucie attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and shirley the loon gail matthius goes to the cinema with a loudmouth fowlmouth rob paulenwhile the premise sounds thin for a featurelength film the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together the best of these is pluckys unfortunate road trip which utilises a golden comedic opportunity very well feeling pity for somebody while also laughing at their predicament pluckys annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork elmyras story definitely ranks second just to see how a little almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals the aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the forefront with buster and babs story which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes but also nostalgically since ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to deliverance including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene featuring the unforgettable tiny toon adventures theme songpart of the universal appeal of the tiny toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of childrens fare that people seem to slap it with an entire segment featuring fowlmouths poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at yappers in a noteperfect way along with an additional jab at lucasfilms thx logo that scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing there are also a couple of moments that poke fun at disney world cinematic plot holes and even warners legal department the fact that todays cartoons are bland and uncreative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come closeafter watching how i spent my vacation for the first time in many years i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to with the ongoing censorship that todays family entertainment receive one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again this review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film but also a plea for spielberg ruegger and dini to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again lord knows that the children of the twentyfirst century is in need for something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures this is not a simple cashgrab it is a wonderful film with full of spirit madcap mayhem and hilarity
0,the disregarded aka dont look in the basement is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror moviethe story is very slow and neer really reaches anything deserving getting emotional aboutthe patients at the psychiatric hospital are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman who ever quotes an old saying to everyone look out for the chip when she stupefy close to the camera assure me you can watch without laughingnow the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesnt really merit its place on the video nasties listoverall if you arent looking for a fantastic horror take and have some time to spare then its deserving a watch
0,first of all this plot is overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby intervenes all lost pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male crushing on the heroine plus singleparent and its so predictable that practically recite along with itsecond of all i really hate how keep on dissing music they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and closeminded in fact i dont recall quote exactly but i remember at one point in the movie holly says why do they have to be so uptightso classical its insulting label classical music in this waythird ive went over it dozens of times but the only reason that think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears there just isnt any point at alland yeah while the actress who portrayed holly im not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasnt as amazing as they making it out to be especially when she was belting she was oversupporting the whole time stars
1,the lubitschs touch is more than ever in this film humour at anytime and very subtle the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect a real piece of comedy that isnt getting so old for a xxist century spectator the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage very funny and no problem with lubitsch there is always an happy end a film for men too confident with women dont let your girlfriend watch this movie
0,this movie is really stupid and very most of the time there are almost no in it at all there is good about this movie on any level just more bad actors pathetically attempting to make a movie so they can get enough money to eat avoid at all costs
1,taboo satellite is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a x however sure elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment was aimed at a midfifties audience that is now gone have see it quite a bit and the films sometimes sluggish pacing doesnt aid but the storys compelling central idea involving the ancientextinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasnt lost its appeal and continue to have this film a relevant must see motion picture show what im largely interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this motion picture show is tremendous the motion picture show has never really looked that just on menage video and its elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen presently and we get a special edition of this sf classic

0,i agree with one commentator who suppose that its truly unimaginable to review glen or glenda objectively if one does so the film on its deserve would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious convoluted dialog the generally mediocre to poor play by the put as well as the zero production values yet such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting go through of watching this film as it stretch out it isnt the fact that the subject of the film is transvestism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the s its not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace surrogate life choices that fascinates leave off as an historical relicno what induce glen or glenda still a fascinating film after years is that ed wood laid his psyche desolate in a path that socalled auteur directors similar hitchcock or godard disdain their vastly superior talents never did in glen or glenda wood isnt afraid to reveal his own deeply contravene feelings about being a transvestite disdain the plea for tolerance for it through out the film so the conclusion of the film suggest that ed woods glen character will be able bodied to obliterate his glenda female person counterpart by transport the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future married woman barbara the psychiatrist even assure glen and barbara that as glen induce that psychic transference glenda will disappear so while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestite in general he wasnt so sure of desiring it for himselfmoreover wood wasnt afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on if it didnt cling so what what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially was ed woods inventive humans in all of its fundamental strangenessthe only gossip i wish to add to my gossip above is that my twostar rating is based exclusively on the objective rating criteria cited in the first paragraph the peculiarly memeric effect the film has disdain its technically flagitious qualities i dont remember can be rated

1,bye bye birdie isnt one of the best musicals of all time but its great fun and approachable to many audiences the master film could have been fantastic with dick avant garde dyke reprising his signature great white way theatrical role but alternatively they tinkered with the plot so the film is very unsatisfying this remake which bare on abc in is far more faithful to the master script and includes some master songs as comfortably that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred tommy tune and ann reinking who choreograph this filmjason alexander is a very different type from dick avant garde dyke but he is comfortably stray as albert before his seinfeld days he lead off in melodic theater genus vanessa hank williams is a perfect tantrum for rear their is also great work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie a theatrical role he played on the national tourthis film is not without its problems though a john major liability is chynna phillips who however appealing simply spirit and seems too old to be teenage kim and george iii wendt is somewhat bland as her father somewhat throwing the number kids aside a number master stray member paul lynde stole the show withbut all in all this is a delightful welldone film which the material deserved

0,i have to say that this movie was not what i expected even i have not the the fact plants can one bait then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a for lunch is about the worst anyone has come up with with the title ruins you would think that out of years that some kind of deity or ancient animal god would be the culprit this another movie primeval would think it was something that villagers fear the most not a crocodile either way film was like it entices you to think about ruins of mayan or inca folklore resulting in and old god or the people had another agenda sacrifice or something that effect but plants come on is nothing else producers come up with to wow a crowd as for this movie it will hit the b list in no time i say that some gore was excellent to see but it didnt make up for the rest of the film and a a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects i do rely on great suspense and whats the scene going to bring for more suspense the thing had a better story line than this did the ring had me jumping for more the ruins is just that ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers the alright the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with flesh eating disorder
0,oh movie this movie is original mediocre just dont really know what exactly to write about it i think its easier to write what its not its not very entertaining end not not and theres not one character in the whole movie switching cared for of reminds me of a certain reality on show holly mtv but without any interesting people it i wait on and tv and i could hardly drags aboutkind it to thing the only thing that kept me from i it off was jennifer lyons ci thought a long time about this boy to find one good the to say out it what i liked was its reminder so to judge a person by the first impression you get as on did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of about of instead of a
1,i have seen a lot of ppvs in the past but this most entertaining ppv and the complete dvd i have ever seen dvd extras are worth it because they it gives a different view of how the wrestlers act after the show such as chris benoit interviewedge interview some glimpse into the monday night wars erathe first match of hogan winning tag title gold and some promotional talk additionally there is good music video tag team table match bubby ray and spike vs eddie and chris benoit this was a pretty good intense match to start off the show not too holds and just pure raw physicallity spike can hold his own in tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat wwe crusierweight championship jamie noble w nidia v kidman really didnt care about either wrestler and didnt get interested until did a shooting star press usually people expect a lot of high flying in a cruiser weight championship this had very little in it was so bad when noble hit his finisher no one even cared or knew you can by the lack of cameras flashing the ending quick though wwe european championship jeff hardy v william ive never really liked regal as a wrestler he lacks intensity style was impressive but really didnt get a chance to show off his high flying act although still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match john cena v chris jericho its funny looking back at cenas first ppv how he used to act how he used and how he used to look watch interview its pretty funny this was a good intense with cena showing a nice of holds suplexes counters and some aerial jericho was but cena launch his career cena wins intercontenital championship rvd v brock lesnar this was a intense and good match both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen with brocks pure power and raw energy vs rvds full moves quickness rvd great in this match better than his later matches with edge and cenaand the entire pace the ending worked perfectly because it still preserved brocks undefeated streak while giving rvd just desserts in his home state no match t v big show another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as rvd match but still a good follow up it started off kinda slow which it always is with big booker t was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table the finisher was awesome the ending was a great upset and big move up for booker t wwe tag team championship hogan and edge christian and lance storm this was a mediocre match hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but of moves lacks that intensity and energy then again christian exactly the greatest athletic abilities himself this ended up being a mediocre at best but was ok for ppv triple threat match for the championship rock v undertaker v kurt angleeasily the match of the year this is by far the best triple threat i have ever seen it had close falls plenty finishers stolen finishers energy intensity and fast pace no one could predict who would come of this one if your going to buy this dvd i would buy it strictly for this match ending watch for yourselfoverall this was a solid ppv with plenty of extra goodies keep you watching again and again although this is hard to find i had a little more than usual for this dvd it is definitely worth your
1,everything about this movie is perfect the set invention the acting the photographic camera movement the mood the colouring everything youll be hard iron out to find a better movie easily the best film generated in the last years keep an eye on michael almereydas
0,hard to criticize this movie because story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it raising arizona with a mean streak the is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry
0,this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying its quite obvious why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated rerunsmost of its plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the producers didnt have an original idea in their heads i havent commented enough youve got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad for a showthe gnome was a nice character

1,i saw a page of madness in a silent film course at wesleyan university and it haunts me still after years truly ahead of its time perhaps even still this gem of a film reveals both the frightening and attractive aspects of madness
0,this picture is not devoid of charm and also register a bite of warmth but ultimately this effort is too conceited and too strongly focused on the leads there is no doubt that mary tyler henry spencer moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight off from the rest of the castanother problem is the overburden of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and first ends up with fairly demean work the seedy network executive director with his executive director toys who goes for glitz over substance the journalist who stick around up for her beliefs etc there is null really untimely with any of these ie they are all securely rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much dejavu and too few surprises
1,great film a very worthy tom hanks was at his usual best the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors based upon a true story tells us how the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away well it did go away albeit temporarily look who we the british amongst others are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms training and money to in the sthis film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice story however once the main objective is achieved ie ridding the communists from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten aboutthis film was good it was a well deserved it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the us to some detail and was dramatised well although being a good film i will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good us v evil russia isnt your thing
1,here is an innovative television puff television set drama which so easily blends a compelling story brilliantly drawn out character development humour itinerary romance and drama into each episode here is a show that sings to its the like own march tune whether its subscribe to audience chooses to follow or not how many other shows on television these days so boldly change in tone from one season to the next high pitched where most of the other it top shows on this site tableland have formula found a formula that works that brings in the viewers and the dollars and have stuck like glue to that formula prison break and desperate housewives come to mind lost takes a different route where even after achieving that plateau and that winning formula the team of executive producers are brave enough to completely reinvent the hera show in order to service their higher goal of compelling storytelling this is where lost differentiates itself from normal television this is how its so plateau defiant of conventional embody tv and this is why lost is one soh of the most cutting edge and innovative creations of modern television forget the obligate naysayers lost is it has been and always will attain be mucilage there to appease feature tableland its cult following first mucilage and the general public next but its a testament to its inventiveness that its garnered a fan base which consists of the best courageous of both audiences
1,at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes steel slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles the battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three steel way fight between demons bandits and soldiers in a atomic number forest during crusade an eclipsebe prepared following a stunning sword wickedness fight under lightning hour filled skies moving picture the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement
0,i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesnt forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the dialogue show angel youll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice and little or tight it wasnt there the pacing was practically backward plot sense were buried under a wendigo of unneeded television and there was absolutely tension points of dread story tension or by it the the is it not speed no its a generate on sea thats the scary it doesnt cameraman a single note of no or atmosphere unless scared youre anythingis mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from redneck audienceterrible film
0,after just minutes into this film i began to miss zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin im sure my opinion is different from many others as im coming from a different background smmf like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story all the butterfly murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this film thats really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasnt extended past her ability to play a naive witch shes so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if theres subparobvious wirework then you probably shouldnt have filmed it at high speed the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though theres a little pilot inside i know that logic doesnt really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did after watching hero and smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films hes definitely off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero was bad
0,a rather disappointing film the club scenes were ok but over done the plot was thin and boring its only redeeming features were some of the characters the chemist and the dj were pretty fun characters tim currys character was just bizarre and stupid
1,forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment stream was aimed actually at a midfifties audience that is now gone have dated it arrive quite a bit moving picture and the films sometimes sluggish pacing doesnt help but the storys compelling central idea involving the ancientextinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasnt lost its horrific appeal and continue to make this film a teras relevant must see movie what im helpless mostly interested in feature saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked demand that good on home return video straight off and its elements are in direct dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic
1,the simpsons of course started off with christmas special simpsons roasting on an open fire which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better this episode centers around bart who in this episode swaps on a test from martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted this leading to bart mending his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates the episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out overall fans of the show will love this episode as it features the characters exactly as they became years later so watch this episode in a pack of season and enjoy early simpsons doing what it was meant to making people laugh i rate this episode
0,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
1,this again a really great ones from hal roach this wellwritten because of two gets reasons the littlest kids in he short are among the cutest to have ever been on the and the plot has is many funny and so and for high littlest shorts the little rascals i honestly cant think of a cuter kid than spanky at about short four despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid being later years film was just precious here and placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the this cute kids was not only funny but once is i on the younger factorafter the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful babysitting job all kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose the gags are pretty effective elementsas welldone for the timewith an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where spanky finally main in of the little age control the most many i havent seen these of in memorable decades and i am glad the gave even one a chance

0,spoilers within was a dull predictable nonscary snorefest the movie had music character development the felt crappy empathy towards scene of the characters except may be the small boy and did not care what happened to any only them i man had so a clichd bits and elements stolen crap was horror moviesthe movie was so predictable many times i would be saying to myself let me guess fill in guess happens next yup i was right even in did opening any i predicted is the attack on the family an by some man probably the father because of the wife and wow were attacked movie enough you is what happened of course that for to wait minutes to find out for sure and of anda another evil man scenario why what he evil or killing his family because hes a man duhas from else stated this movie may be scary have someone under years of standards or for many movie someone the s but it that far from being a iscary movie by todays attention and lot so many other that horror movies a like of the scares age fakes scary music scary no scary music course crow suddenly flies at the window children scaryhow did the old bank guy manage a few times to walk across other open lot without the father seeing him sure thought for sure from the old movie was a ghost nope just a no moviei rated this i a out of because it the keep my were enough to sit through the whole thing
1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score out of
0,the forgotten aka dont look in the basement is a very cheaply made video recording and very old looking horror moviethe story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited aboutthe patients at the tattily asylum are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone look fleck out for the bit when she gets close to the camera tell embody me you can watch without laughingnow the kayoed gore reckon is very poor looking with the blood last looking pink in evidence many scenes so it doesnt really reckon deserve its place on the video nasties listoverall if you arent looking information technology for a fantastic horror film and have some rouse time to spare then its worth a watch
0,having school this film last night i turned off the taut player with a sense of deserving i medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end throughout the film a felt that i was watching the storyline fillers that porn dvd in a high budget you movie the acting was stiff and get camera work appalling and the locations and sets were so poor it adams like they had borrowed them from the local high endured amateur dramatics societythe only saving grace for harriet had was that and movie amy felt it this sansom harris in its credits other than that it was pure dribble
0,neat premise very unrealistic what i buckeye state learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend buckeye state cabin may not be the kayoed best idea after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the well educated hill with no injury at all unfortunately the same cant be said for his gal oh and the police type a never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wrecklots of dragged out scenes including a plain nobelium stripper still have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy trunk embody and his crummy useless hand tush i admit i was intrigued to see what dispirited the mysterious thing was behind the door but when it come to appeared i just laughed ha ha ha the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really embody would want a new body after an excruciating experience like proboscis that

0,with this movie only running minutes and nothing that good on i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time even while the from which it was coming i was sorely disappointed started with the quality of the opening score what no brooding music and then the rather slow moving opening sequences gosh i a movie zombies even from the s would have some chills to it white zombie bela lugosi certainly did this had zero it was scarcely dramatic except for the few moments with the burning superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of the zombies this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own but nothing more
1,i to this make more than i expected the has muscle action intrigue and locations to movie of worth your while while i cant quite yet see mark wahlberg as a leader hes gotten good enough to be a credible manager like thats okthe superhero movie the it is the mini cooper its shown to have it speed dexterity and enough to pull off any job and enjoyed handle a maniac driver and charlize therons character
1,this was one of the to woman films i parents seen at the cinema when i who a child it is good to our it the girl end taylor because later well rooney beautiful color starred excellent with the tiny and together actor mickey a the content of the film plot ethics good for all ages good wills and behavior good is of velvets have particularly her mother is something first take account into remember generations should be became educated and this film may help to this purpose velvet loves the horses and racing them and mi taylor rooney brought her to an international horse racing competition in england where at the liz the young velvet won but was disqualified was of being female
1,like in circle the movie leads back to its point of departure the image of the cranes that are crossing muscovite sky they represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to the greatest possible fulfilmentin the beginning veronica and boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in it seems as if they might be able to according to their dreamsbut man is not a bird life draws up its own rules from which no human can escape and which we cannot change not even by a supreme effort war breaks out and without much hesitation boris signs up for the front in order to his patriotic duty he cannot even say goodbye to veronica for she arrives late the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away surrounded by a crowd all attempts attract boris attention must inevitably failboris eventually gets killed in war veronica learning about it the his brother mark a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from service by corruption is eager to take place initially resists but a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms a marriage takes place which is never accepted by the familysoon feelings of guilt seize hold of veronica and she realizes boris return is the one and thing she longs for she therefore her bad and despair by the selfsacrificing work in a field war finally is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers again veronica among them forcing way a wall of bodies in her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers of the homecomers has just dashed her by confirming the sad certainty of deathonce again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines but now is them on her and the look in her eyes is a different one has had to accept the impossibility to live to preconceived plans to the guidelines of your dreams for all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the strings of fate
0,in one rubbish i cant think of one good thing looks wanted movie i conclusion was poor acting acting was forgot up the effects well there were no effects the cant believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick of start lines finishthe front cover to the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i in like a scary villain but like for old saying but judge out book by the cover the whole terrible looked like a cardboard cut looked about part talk its film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs villain the pounds was bad enough setting they could of and the whole thing in lapland but have a tropical island insteadi took this movie as a spoof which i think they this it to them never islandlastly only a that made me laugh in thing bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i havent grabbed the first the but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldnt a itthe biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs a the they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between to like fifty the producer in attempted last minute panic must of watched the actors like the street gave them the script told them they no minutes to practise these to set shoot on a the one the in the film was painful it was like the actors terrible their ordinary lines and made be and the way throughin screenplay i give this film stars out of
0,well i regretful grownup have to say this body forth movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i didnt awry have to review it for work and the worst part helium is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove embody all over the city paid parking two park times because feature the newspaper listings were wrong vince vaughn plays the guy he always does the only time embody ive seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta anyways the plot has potential it sounded redeem great in the preview walk but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didnt have to be saved and feature that santa didnt need a replacdmetn but nope the only cool part was the constantly sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character im sure this movie would be great for base on balls potency young kids but for adults its so lame that its chore to sit through
1,enjoyed the movie very much certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more and there is truly a lot more historically to find outdid the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization particularly of the shooting event there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at prince alberts contribution to uk and the monarchy warrants a movie on its own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention herethe costumes and sets are especially good but am i alone in thinking that this production which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one wanted badly for a british court historical etiquette expert beyond the duchess of york ie did princess victoria really stuff an entire trufflerissole into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of his majesty with her mouth full could never really felt that sympathetic to victoriain this movie or indeed in her shoes at all yet loved the casting of the principals whose acting was convincing so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well i always felt like a totally detached uninformed outside observer much more so than with mrs brown or even the queen yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes off the screen except that is for some of the more avantgarde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time

1,ridewhy is one of there best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films once my neighbor totoro and kikkis delivery service blood away is quite better but a bit too spirited for to family fare and for much and adult the one thing that sets laputa castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a is adventure this is this film well good because its a complete is the animation is very so done and the story is truly detailed and compellingmost japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark particularly cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems have sound people the sky it has imagination adventure burn good the characters are well drawn if back exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trenchcoat wearing posers the is plenty of to but for that and gore we animation package smooth engaging and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderfulthe version acting two the dubbed the voice tensionfilled first der particularly the in leads minor james van aspect beek and we anna studio the sound engineering is great too use your paquin castle if youve got itone rate creepy i or enjoyed is that much of the slightly story is left unexplained laputa to include inhabited and is now abandoned why the never know we know as teenagers as sheeta need to know and then we just plague to accept the rest which is easy typical do because the invented world is so was realized than it is fair to say that english world is more fully realized indeed most of the pazo characters who are for the most part onedimensional stock characters eg gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended not in aged fully
0,i usually can tolerate twisted movies but this one is really a sick obsessive selfabsorbed moviefirstly the writerdirector is totally a selfabsorbed guy full of sick jokes that are not funny at all secondly he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons childrens mind i cant believe my ears when i heard the sick and perverted monologues spoken by the kidsi really feel sorry for zane adlum and devon matthews they are both very talented but fell prey to eric schaeffers dirty littleknown movieand what the hell happened to eric mabius good looking face i mean he met this girl that hes supposed to marry but he wasnt in the wedding in fact there is this bald guy in his place did time really fly that fastanyway dont waste your time to see this movie unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by one sick eric schaeffer
1,three american lads are backpacking their way around europe challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they can but andy seeks true love he finds this during their bungeejump attempt on the eiffel tower when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heartburstingly beautiful julie delpy his attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action romance gore and inspired humor without ever taking itself to seriously or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining minute ride i have seen this film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the london original although both films are so different it is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel

1,it is in the ruling of this reader that the right time to be a kid was in the s a period when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were creditworthy for some of the right syndicate entertainment to hit the airwaves the right producers of saturday morning animation were at warner brothers television who welcome a john major golden mature with the dreamteam of steven spielberg uncle tom ruegger and paul dini along with serious and dark serial same batman they also revivify cuckoo outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tune animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult mood and court to the cinema of yesteryear and today but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by reinvent the looney tune for a new generation while still keeping that screwball toon vehemence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any mature aggroup no matter how old even when the tiny toons were stretched to a featurelength with how i spent my holiday it did not tone same a longer episode of the television serial a curse that so ofttimes plagues other featurelength adaptation of popular animated showsthe tiny toon gang up are young offsprings of the classic toon characters who made audiences laugh book binding in the s and s and are currently learning toon comedy to earn their toon degree summer holiday has started and each character has their own idea of what to do buster bunny charles ix adler and babs bunny tress macneille start a water supply gun fight which ultimately leads to acme acres getting flooded and them both sailing down the mississippi plucky duck joe alaskey joins hamton pig don messick on a crosscountry car trip to the happiest stem park in the world but hamtons syndicate examine to be more hard than he imagined meanwhile in other stories break up passim elmyra duff cree summer tries to line up a vomit up to hug and squeeze fifi lupus erythematosus fume kath soucie attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and shirley the loon gail matthius goes to the cinema with a loudmouth fowlmouth surcharge paulenwhile the premise vocalise thin for a featurelength film the many conductor and screenwriters make all the stories work on well together the right of these is pluckys unfortunate road trip which utilises a golden comedic chance very well flavour pity for someone while also laughing at their quandary pluckys annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork elmyras story definitely outrank minute just to see how a little almost free girl can causal agency fear into so many jungle animals the aforementioned toon vehemence definitely comes to the forefront with buster and babs story which makes us smile not only referable to the hilarity of the outcomes but also nostalgically since ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that section practically half of that section plays as a parody and court to deliverance including a clever whirl on the dueling banjos tantrum featuring the unforgettable tiny toon adventures stem songpart of the universal appeal of the tiny toons is that the mood examine to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that examine that it does not at all deserve the title of childrens fare that people seem to bolt it with an entire section featuring fowlmouths poor etiquette at the cinema poking playfulness at yappers in a noteperfect way along with an additional jab at lucasfilms thx logotype that tantrum is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema register there are also a couple of moments that poke playfulness at disney world cinematic diagram holes and even charles dudley warner legal department the fact that today cartoons are bland and uncreative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated serial that will amount closeafter watching how i spent my holiday for the first time in many class i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite a same they used to with the ongoing censorship that today syndicate entertainment welcome unmatchable wonders whether anything same this will ever be made again this review is not only a recommendation of a truly sassy film but also a supplication for spielberg ruegger and dini to squad up again and bring off a magical conception to our minds once again lord knows that the baby of the twentyfirst century is in motive for something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures this is not a unsubdivided cashgrab it is a wonderful film with full of flavor madcap havoc and hilarity

0,oh boy this movie is so mediocre i dont really know what exactly to write about it think easier to write what not its not very entertaining its not original and theres not one character in the whole movie i cared aboutkind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv but without any interesting people it just drags on and on i could hardly wait it to end the only thing kept from switching it off was jennifer lyons ci thought a time movie to find one thing to say about it what liked was the reminder not judge a person by the first impression you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of out instead of a
0,if you want to see how to ruin a film study this one very closely in fact it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about minutes realism escapes this movie on every level the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script wannabe actors an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomedi rented this once and i swear i got stupider watching it if you are a humanitarian buy this horrible horrible movie and burn itunwatched as a favor to the world it has no discernible plot bad acting and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape seriously the paint would be better i wish i could give this negative stars

0,not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the s but not for the st century
1,this is one of my favorite films of all time i the book and liked it but this movie expands on everything made famous the acting is fantastic especially from jon voight who plays sir very evil character this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout until the end where is pulled together for a great ending i also love the this is directed by flashing back and forth between the modern day and stanleys ancestors the story was written by louis sachar yes but it seems that this story is made for film and andrew does a great job directing it i recommend this to anyone enjoys good movies
0,i of late watched the film recently and put in it poorly embody resembles the book is based on record i blame this on poor screenplay and direction some parts were forcibly introduced the gay rape embody scene for no apparent reason i actually read the book after watching the movie and some years or so after reading it for the first time i found it hard close to embody to read and somewhat clumsy too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit information technology at unwell all other than sensational parts for the time as it covers stuff that was deemed isensitive to say the least during communism i can see the fascination it produced at the time embody that isnt the encounter case anymore though or maybe i see things differently now or a bit of overly both the film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book the result being embody a concoction of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book overly even so this is a film that is difficult to intellect watch and maybe should have never been made

1,one year after love thy neighbour made its itv debut it followed the route taken by on the buses and isteptoe son by graduating onto the big screen in a picture made by hammer films it opens with a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of englands green and pleasant land then cuts to a shot of eddie and bill walking up a street arguing furiously this escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbours vandalising their each others homes at least the original theme tune is retained even if it is sung by someone other than stuart gillies the local paper the gazette is holding a contest to find the best neighbours the winners landing a mediterranean cruise barbie suggests to joan that they should enter the thing is can bill and eddie stay friends long enough to win it thats the main part of the plot the film is by and large episodic one chunk is lifted directly from season namely bill and eddie going to the club pretending to be on union business in reality theyre going to see a stripper not meeting two girls another portion of the movie has bill along with other black factory workers in the series he was the only one breaking a strike eddie has helped bring about by various ploys including being smuggled in through the gates in beer barrels while another seemingly inspired by powell and drivers for the love of ada sees eddies talkative mother the magnificent patricia hayes getting friendly with bills father charles hyatt the climax to episode season reappears in an expanded form bill once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify eddie but his friends join him and they dance round a drum containing a naked booth so that they can pretend to cook and eat him eddie then has to make his way home in the nude surprisingly there is less nudity here than there was in episode season the film ends with the reynolds and the booths winning the love thy neighbour contest and taking the cruise together but theres an unexpected twist involving joans sexmad brother cyril james beck private walker of dads army who is working as a stewardthis is your typical s sitcomintomovie with all the faults usually prevalent in such films the laughs are scattered about and interest wanes after about half an hour the cast is augmented by familiar faces such as melvyn hayes cast as terry a character from episode season played on that occasion by leslie meadows bill fraser as the factory manager anna dawson andria lawrence who seems to have been in every s british comedy film mostly cast as nymphomaniacs and arthur english the director john robins was also responsible for the man about the house moviefunniest moment while eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory bill paints his face black the first he knows of it is when the managers secretary screams in terror the tables have been turned
0,i really waterthis cut how could someone give this disgusting review more than star how can you like such a retarded film where all the animal abuse scenes are real i dont even want to imagine the excruciating called those violence and will living beings felt in those horrific moments jesus what horribly of human would torture them like that for that reason or just for money i i you speak director is either dog retarded or hes just a monster heartless a heart of give this both he truly deserves will get its their understand off and burn aliveit contains various kind barbaric liked that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water the with is beaten birds are thrown into the cant movie is or than awful it has to be believe worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one but cannibal holocaust or something like that ill it watch or buy any film directed by more mentally monster no one should waste hands time watching there especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out it in which all the animal abuse the are stagedfortunately only a they people scenes this which is natural since his the worst film ever so never shut successful i hope this defenseless make a retarded director realize that such unjustified probably acts of extreme cruelty and innocent to real animals just never be praised and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films i truly dont no everyone receives but what they stone there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel humans to feel scenes same pain few once inflicted to othersthis however is barbaric my only negative film tell usually the comment on a movie if time dislike it pain this i i will couldnt wasnt up i had to that the truth because animal abuse must stop

0,is probably the worst excuse for television programming since oh i dont know whats happening now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though its mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves you dont get any good details into their personal its mostly just them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like white trash i love britneys as much the next babe but this show is just pure filler for a nation addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her toenails yes that could be an actual episode thank god these two broke up because they were painfully dull together this show is toxic
1,i must confess that i dont remember this film very well but certainly i liked it i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel really and of course its one of the best movie from christopher lamberta good movie about tarzan as cult as the ones with weissmuller
0,carlos mencia is not funny from his stand up specials to this train wreck of a tv series carlos mencia is not funny i have been trying to convince people for two years that he steals other comedians jokes and as far as his comedy material goes he is a regular johnnycomelately with far less than subpar results psycho astronaut jokes britney spears breakdown jokes i hope this is only a scheduling error but come on carlos and comedy central those topics and many others have run the gamut of late night tv show hosts opening monologues saturday night live mad tv and many many others lampooning ethnic and racial stereotypes comedy stands no chance of evolving with carlos mencia around perhaps people especially viewers and comedy central executives will get the point since this weeks issue of new york magazine accurately labeled him carlos mencia unrepentant jokefilcher
0,i didnt like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally in s so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this was my moviegoing tastes the s or was it that stripes simply a bad movie well the verdict is in and stripes is a bad movienow stripes have been innovative comedy in the early s and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill fans but its still a bad moviewhy is it bad mostly because stripes to be a comedy but its just not that funny are some laughs but they are few and far between most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which incredibly and very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if youre used to more contemporary comedies such anchorman which strive for laughs in every part the moviestripes further suffers from bill murray and ramiss lack acting ability bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor this point in his career and harold ramis is playing harold ramis these two are just not good enough as to carry the dramatic arch of the movielastly most of the comedy that there in revolves around bill murrays selfcentered manchild character so if you dont find that character funny like i didnt youre not going to find most of what little comedy there is stripes funny eitherstripes is very much a its era it hasnt aged well and is not worth watching to watch an s buddy comedy i would recommend stir crazy like stripes the humor in stir crazy is not as fastpaced as in contemporary comedies but unlike it has much better as a is still watchable
1,who should watch film anyone who has ever taken acid read philip k dick thought the of the matrix was better then the special effects has an interest philosophy or likes having their sense of reality messed with i laughed out loud film just because it so outrageous and so spoton this film is great this film is cool it is better than the matrix a long shot fall asleep in existenz for kick off actionspecial effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical gloss that is exactly what matrix is existenz is gross it is disturbing and it is funny david cronenberg has done some stuff rabid and some works of genius too videodrome is one worth checking out as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone but this is one my alltime favourites i cant remember the which is a good thing it means i can watch it again perhaps never watched film at all maybe its an implanted memory or maybe it really happened to me i dont at any rate it is now seamlessly stitched overall illusion of reality and im glad
0,oh the hilarity oh the joy another film that is so bad type a its pop out good or so i thought in actual fact this one misses the so bad its good feature phase and goes sadly straight to the could one half have soh been so bad its good but they screwed it up and made it plain badfor a start its way too long cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable then put in such ludicrous plots unawares as the man who is sabotaging the there mission to save the earth because he has all deal out the food stockpiled and hell be rich if the information technology mission fails duh or the talking bomb plot device last seen in dark star guess past whatjust like in cancelled dark star operating theatre the bomb has a malfunctionhmmmm add in a dash of we cant act our way get out of a kindergarten play go along and you have solar crisis in a nutshelllight relief arrive is to be had in spend a penny the form of jack palance or jack pants as we called him in this flick whose sole purpose embody in the film is to drive a kid minimal brain dysfunction around the desert and telephone the kids cartel dad to come pick him associate in nursing upeventually between driving and phoning jack dispenses pointless it drivel and leers and cackles a maine lot jest at but contributes little to the embody story such as it is in short hes the best bit of the moviemy award for the most ironic line delivered straightfaced goes to charlton heston who when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages comments that his son looks a little out of shape whilst he himself is standing embody there with his gut run out bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a captain kirk corsetalso amusing is the bad guys top henchman who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy warhol for some reasonapart from it these hilarities theres little to recommend this movie the ending is a sequence copied from type a but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from slight tips for enjoying this movie more if you are foolish enough to enjoy watch it like i did testament any time the bomb distaff speaks overlook imagine its called tarquin trust me it overlook works whenever chuck heston is embody on screen and about to speak preempt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as regretful get your filthy moving picture paws off me or similar whenever the female lead is soh looking stressed this is most of the time police chief keep hoping dopy against hope that shes having an aneurism and will die type a soon during the interminable the ships broke again twist scenes keep hoping the techengineer guys feature will spout a scottyism like you cannae wholly change the laws of physics arrive or some such crapother than that do what it takes to get you through this one i dozed off half way through and woke delegation to realise i hadnt missed anything nor had the plot laughable feature though it is advanced any so dont worry ridicule about tuning out for a few you wont miss anything
1,kubrick again puts on atomic number display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for helium a film mainly through cinematography but also using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and helium ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start it really information technology is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes of course lie it doesnt hurt motion picture photography that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances ive ever seen a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be nice embody but its easy to look past those two when the arresting rest of the film is so presentation brilliant plus it features atomic number scarey chef doeuvre the actor with the greatest name of all asset time scatman crothers

1,when i was in understanding gradeback in i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of of english and studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when recall tv version came out makes year laterkristy mcnichol was a popular and actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a a to on movie hit tv series family it expresses or that she had be range and ability appropriately pull the this in i a her as being a bit stiff at times but over intensity she th a the job she carries the off wellesther rolle is the as the domestic who appears to be the only it part the household that seems bruce truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened tv slightly neurotic makes is also good as is young appealing lively who would eventually parents as the black widow lana of in twin peaksas the sweet younger sister who seems to the the focus of the appear affection to davidson is also to robin as the german soldier milford the titlethe best performance however belongs and michael constantine it is truly powerful to merited more recognition than one got at the only the bitterness and coldness he was mother the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but dysfunctional it much easier to understand good quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right all class seems to have a good does my fantastic underlying psychological motivationsthe film differs from the book time in some small ways it is wonderful and released family watch and i hope that it gets inspiring again on to video clear dvd
0,what can i say about a movie as bad as this the people who made this movie didnt even try to make the monster in it look realistic you never see more than its head and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar and the sound they used for the roaring is the best part at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over i couldnt believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes there isnt much more to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle still its watchable if you like this sort of trash i know i do
1,i watched this movie for the first time ever on the sci fi channel and i mustiness say it was simply awesome for those of you whom loves the never ending story this is one that would convey cover memories of that movie even though it is a movie it has a blurry like lay and look which makes it feel like it is a fantasy the acting was brilliant and the music was enceinte especially the beginning fight song and oddment song to those of you who have yet to see it watch it i recommend completely

1,i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a family get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an ex pat she was very antibritish she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end

0,another sadistic and ultrasleazy late searly s revenge movie wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a ripoff of other ripoffs like i spit on your grave and especially night train murders storywise this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleazefactor by a thousand this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three this is a very tame movie and there wasnt even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women but the sex in terror express isnt unsettling at all on the contrary these rapists spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves the music is great the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever beheld the villains are wimps and the trainpassengers are so motionless they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled terror express should be in the pornsection of videostores

0,i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan ho hum standpoint i was not expecting a great deal embody and thought they likely could not mess it up too much oh dear how wrong was ithe main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with in the main a information technology nice helping of supernatural goingson swordfights and the likeyou got some gore but everything else was just pretty lifeless the middle section just seemed to involve minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horsedrawn carts and even slower simply dialogue and character developmenton the plus side pushcart costumes and effects were fine but not enough to american samoa keep your interesti think it would have been better to tone down the gore up the tempo and go for a a rating as a ten year old spate timber boy i may have liked this movie non probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories not funny enough perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the filmor go really mint arthouse with tone direction etc forwards but thats fairly highrisk as type a far as box office is concernedoh well perhaps the next wait costume conan movie will make up perchance for it
1,my definition of a great movie is if you want to continue to see it over again this movie for some reason strikes a cord in me even though the scenes with scott glenn still make me winch i watch it over and over again and love the music
1,sharkys machine is a crime drama set in early s atlanta it stars burt reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city the story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to its knees sharkys link to bringing down this syndicate is a highpriced hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie the action sequences are well done for the early s and the soundtrack score are pretty good the acting is blevel but this is a pretty decent film to have in your dvd collectionoverall peace buggieblade

1,the vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization there were many subgenre picture show shoemakers last yr from a multitude of countries ive go over many and have a few more to discuss forgive my indulgence but since ive recognized the trend as a phenomenon which it is and coincidentally feature article my favorite horror staple im going to now move outdoor of north america for a act and introduce you to hopefully meaning picture show that you didnt see as of nowof the many impression of dusk is the creation of bozo and fille vampire movies i detest this sexist categorization which has the event of polarizing an entire genesis of buff into incline i suppose men are prone to detest stephenie meyers work and its offspring to some level because they feel some sense of treason that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated adult female may be unlikely to delight future neutral picture show since they grew up with brassbound expectations that were enforced quartet times we need more film director to create vampire picture show which either gender is capable of enjoying unequally if vampires are going to pull through the craze and remain relevant cue thirst this korean film was directed by park chanwook of oldboy celebrity there are two ways to analyse it either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable or it is a floundering mess that doesnt settle which prey audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one dont let me convince you that the film has no tendency its director is a humankind whose celebrity is storydriven action picture show its protagonist is male and has a passiveaggressive concern in his lover more on this later soundless his desire for a woman he has do it both before and after someone spirit up is not contrived and his attention is returned there is a male slant to this visualize yet it is not so onesided that adult female could not delight it the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moonthe plot watch over an emile zola novel called thrse raquin which i have not read according to wikipedia the novel is about an affair that modernize between a married woman and a single humankind he kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are incompetent of having sex because they visualize the dead mans trunk between them they are thus repel to insanity but care for the womans poorly mother at the novels conclusion they stress to drink down each other discover each others project and commit suicidenow transcribe this nearly yr old french novel into bodoni font south korea and youve got thirst chanwook doesnt pad the story enough to elevate this to mustsee he oftentimes discount many of his own ideas in prefer of following his inspiration i suppose the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative his use of the motherinlaw as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect see itthe protagonist is originally a devout christian who becomes a vampire after a wrong rip transfusion following his volunteer for a new medicine he thus becomes the god he once was smitten with masses flock to him and view him as a grand healer ok thats really sang froid and could have allow for a large fundament for his relationship yet this idea is given niggling idea screen time as he changes into a realistic the nazarene figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it instead of face the delusional masses he instead sips rip out of comatose hospital patientslets continue with the christian allusion the woman tricks the vampire humankind into killing her husband her overprotective motherinlaw suffers a stroke and eventually warns ally of the kin of her daughterinlaws treachery finger waggle the humankind kills her but revive her the two of them invite other ally over and the woman begins remorselessly chivy the humans the humankind says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for first light with him they both croak but he atones for her crimes and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominentlythe woman character is a caricature and her profession offer up an explanation for her behavior she is a homemaker with no education while the humankind is a priest whose someone spirit up was restrictive vampirism magnifies their characteristics she becomes a monster the likes of one would expect of someone without knowledge he becomes a demigod with a spirit up his spirit up is how atheists view themselves and her spirit up is how religious masses view those without churchman intervention

1,this movie establish that the free enterprise system and the quest for the all powerful buck transcends all racial and ethnic roadblock at last the market place make up ones mind the message that is sent to the public this movie pad that point a materialistic whitecollar publicise troupe is taken over by a group of streetwise african americans chaired by a nononsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell intersection by telling the the truth but the movie establish that no matter how hard he tries to do something different the market place and the political system demands that he conform rendering him no different than his predecessors concern offbeat movie
1,i enjoyed this movie a lot i call back that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime full stop in american english history there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class scheme i feel that the case of lilly was depict correctly and could of not been done in effect what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love rattling was throughout the movie all of the men that hang for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had met cortland she did not sympathise why these men move over up everything for happiness the way of life her life had over up was far from what she expected to be possible id recommend this movie to anyone of a senesce audience so you are able bodied to sympathise the content and the underlaying meaning of the movie and plot
1,ive seen a few movies in my time but this one is olympian youll have to watch it more than once to sincerely appreciate it it is emotionally very complex it research love and passion at its most extreme and its cinematography is just breathtaking the character of the reckon is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed impart his layer the plastic film is utterly vomit up and utterly acted the plastic film has a sort of numerical precision and perfection to it which is rare these days it combines action love tragedy play and politics all in one this movie is unmissable all the hype surrounding it and all the awards cannot begin to do it any justness hats off to michael ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which it is free base
