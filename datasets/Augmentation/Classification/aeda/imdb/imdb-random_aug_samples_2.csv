1,i think this film has much to recommend it particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very very hard to follow in some cases all in all it makes for a nice time in front of the tube

0,this film is just as bad as the birdman of alcatraz i do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures moreover it disturbs me when well respected revered actors like alan alda and burt lancaster play such roles because their status tends to lend credibility to the directors intent to elevate the films subject a societal outcasti was in junior high school during the last years of caryl chessmans life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news i remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and chessman was the victimget a grip people read the history chessman was a criminal and sexual predator he drove around the la streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle he stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest then abducted and raped the women rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and humiliationchessman got exactly what he deserved it just took a decade too long no sympathy for the devil here

1,this is one of my all time favoritesif the movie has a flaw its that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesnt so much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewers imaginationmoroders languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee like the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails and gnashes broods and tugs a constant reminder of tonys inexorable fatenot so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train

1,fado is a sad almost bluesy style of portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly trough the movie as explained by one of the main characters igor it also means fateindeed its fate that bring the two main characters paco and alex together and triggers the problems that ensueon the whole i enjoyed it quite a bit it starts out as an on the down and outs dramaroad movie an builds into a suspenseful thriller  road moviethere were two things that i found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a higher rating i gave it an 8 the first is the major point of why did alex give the stuff away she was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport for a paltry sum and then she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger her explanation was unconvincing also how did they get through the gate where were the cops

0,id never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is more entertaining than this 90s era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high octane cop shows such as csi csi miami and so forth im not saying all these shows are bad but they arent good either i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypescountertypes thats right stereotypescountertypes unfortunately this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in gothpunk clothing and they start harassing him now this is exactly what middle america perceives the gothpunk culture i mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot its always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood okay not everyone whos a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what middle red state america sees of these people finally why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick cant you make the sidekick an equal asskicker

1,it is a great movie i sow that some people think that this might not be based on a true story no matter this  the movie is great and all u can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town and so on instead thinking that a little girls wish came true and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do all in this world to make them true the little girl desi  in the movie and her mom were the best actors ive been seen in a long time good for they for all actors all for the director if someone can tell them this please tell them a 25 year guy from romania says thank you for making this movie
0,it was so disjointed  it seemed to jump from place to place  and the thief was obvious it was a poor mans not to mention high school less than zero i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add so many issues are left unresolved and thats okay  but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder whats exactly going on is terrible the voiceover is needed because the movie doesnt work on its own avoid this movie and watch something else about rich teen angst im sure there are plenty of others to watch dont waste your time on this
1,with a film starring the twins ekin cheng and edison ; chen nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of hollywoodstyle vampires no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment and jackie chansure the kungfu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure the script reminds you of blade and sure the whole affair is instantly forgettablebut for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would be hard pushed to find better
1,its not sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a great career but taken as a whole because there are no famous personalities the film seems more realistic than some high budget well cast filmsa film made for a few bucks that is worthy of watching should give hope to all those would be film makers and wantabee actorsthe problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time tv was taking over the revenues of the film industry and this film could have easily been shown on tv in 1950 all the fare on tv would qualify for a g rating the film industry began to make more adult films that could not be shown on tv during the days when tv wouldnt dare show the sex and skin of todays commercials

1,clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over 200 votes and a paltry 9 user comments written for it its a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasnt done the film any favours over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought its just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning storyrobert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we dont see his face but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchums shadow so really its solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high perhaps its unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but its dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable 7510

1,spoilerstom and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every single short is a gem while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts there is not way you can hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes and i can say that i agree but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others here is the plot of fraidy cat tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry observes how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is he creates scary dilemmas for tom and tom becomes scared out of his wits and his lives jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost tom finds out that jerry did all of this and chases him tom then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cupoverall this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts anyway this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice710

1,first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code sure you have the religion vs science problem but it doesnt try to make a big statement about it its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well one scene particularly that involves fire i found extremely well done second the changes from book to film although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others i gotta admit i was wrong it was refreshing that the film didnt follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though however the big twist is still there so dont worry about that finally im glad they removed some silly subplots and didnt even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary thats okay for a film like this id give it a 910 mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment

0,this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the realworld the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film schooli do not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciationi do recommend this film to the average or belowaverage mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriationit is a total waste of what little production value it has
0,i remember when this was in theaters reviews said it was horrible well i didnt think it was that bad it was amusing and had a lot of tongueincheek humor concerning families around holiday timeben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract that was funnyso he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read of course the family has a hot daughter for the love interest and he learns that the holidays arent so bad after allalso the whole doodah act was funny especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy and the girlfriendss parents didnt even say anything about it and the parts where doodah is hitting on his supposed daughter final verdict i thought its worth checking out if you catch it on cable

0,this may not be the worst comedy of all time but its close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it backchris kattan is funny for about 10 minutes his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of former snlers that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed miserably theres not much middle ground in this category although chris farley was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then deadso i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one careeravoid this movie like the plaguec
0,this movie supposedly a thriller had about five subplots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end but it ended up more as a yawnthe writing was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring george clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym matt damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompterthe worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business oil and the middleeast i have seen documentaries provide more excitement watch it only if theres absolutely nothing else to do

1,a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes dont be fooled by 2point4 childrens cheerful tune and bubbly characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling and thats whats so good about the show its not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a 2d comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full rollercoaster of human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile its a real shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd veohcom is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops

1,the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a slow moody but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion the film will not be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it okin the early moments of the film we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if theyre lucky while climbing through a barbed wire fence the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him the gun through the fence the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fenceanyway once his brother is killed 12yrold arnold regresses into his own world he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family seems to shun him perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold even though the older brothers death allows him to hit on the kids girlfriend arnolds parents dont seem to understand how to deal with their son they really dont even try to talk to him about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after a while arnold even moves in with the old timernothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncles exwife once he meets her he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the familys turmoil with the accident from here on the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakeningthe acting is hauntingly distant in most cases robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newmans performance in hud the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody pictures about common folk this one may be for you some even may be advised to bring some tissues 8 of 10 starsthe hound

1,i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell  but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in 49th parallel but they are nazis who consider him  a liberal westerner canadian  fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful  or try to be soulful witness his poet  dreamer  wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter  but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny  the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here  it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to 1934 like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby  she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in 1934 leading to the largest write  in campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she costarred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest

0,"i might not be a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more five years after its predecessor george ? romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this ? outing pens the screenplay for steve kings three stories though the direction is handed off to michael gornick the film mostly falters in that aspect , with uneven brushes by gornick but most of the blame would have to go to romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringelike script especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story moralistic messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply took over the black humour oh it was painful and ? the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture loosely linking the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective : wraparound story done in nostalgia 80s animation form i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light  the first story old chief woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors george kennedy  dorothy lamour of a general store in a dying native community dead river get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood in front of the store is a wooden statue of an ? indian chief that comes to live , to avenge their deaths listen to george kennedy waffle and waffle on for 10 minutes about how hes committed to his great community what a nice touchy feely ? time well just like kennedys speeches this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when the indian comes alive and turns avenger the goons meet a ? very quick though grisly death in the proper , fashion the effects were commendably done but what about that free , flowing hair how could hollywood knock that lock of : hair back : ugh  second story the raft follows . a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking : in the water now this is much better much better what starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy setup thats full of tight and claustrophobic tension and it doesnt even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark gornicks direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side while the alarming music score on this occasion pressed : the right chords the sludgelike creature in the lake like many have mentioned looks like an icky black tarpaulin yeah youre reading that right floating on the water  finally number three concludes with the hitchhiker a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after ! being with her male gigolo but shes is running late thinking of some ideas to explain for her ! lateness if needed she skids off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker instead of checking or : getting help she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough shes being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhikernot awful but i really didnt get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role but that constant assuring , and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired the vivid makeup effects are welldisplayed and dripping with vision when she hits the hitchhiker thats when it becomes hectic cheesy and overthetop in its execution from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this happens every time she decides to run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling in all the second short story the raft and the unpleasantly wellconceived effects is what ! lifts this : extremely inferior sequel"

0,no wonder this movie never saw the light of day the timing was of the release was awful the gong show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie came out so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show and the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic 90minute whine by chuck barris about how hard his life was as host of the show did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messedup millionaire life did he really think we even wanted to know about his life obviously so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a cia operative did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes or the network executive hounding him at every turn this might have worked as the plot for a 30minute sitcom episode but not as a fulllength movie however it was nice to see rip taylor gene gene and the unknown comic again although to make the movie spicy they included only his most vulgar routines and as someone else has pointed out this is phil hartmans first significant movie part even though it lasts only a minute note his name is spelled hartmann in the credits which is the name he was born with you cant miss his voice and facial expressions even though hes much thinner and younger than in the snl days ed molinaro hill street blues also has a tiny part one of his first after leaving the soap world

1,the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television historyits hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence sublime writing or first rate performancesacross its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality centering around the life of one tony soprano a man who lives in two families one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group of which he is the boss of both played by james gandolfini of true romance and the mexican fame tony is a fascinating scary but also likable guy full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tonythe cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for everthe true genius of this tale however is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series twenty minute long dream sequences powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love honour and respect for family the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitouswith tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as americas most original and compelling drama forget family redifined this is television redifined

1,this is one of my all time favourite movies if ur not into cars then forget it this movie features 1 of aussies greatest muscle cars the xygtho yeah so the acting not the greatest  it was never made to win an oscar the car action will keep you comin back for more and more there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70s and an awesome 57 chev  with a real cool cat drivin it also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this movie big fast cars with pleantly of steelno plastic cars and some cool street dragging i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting

0,i might not be a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more five years after its predecessor george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve kings three stories though the direction is handed off to michael gornick the film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by gornick but most of the blame would have to go to romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringelike script especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story moralistic messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply took over the black humour oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture loosely linking the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia 80s animation form i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light  the first story old chief woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors george kennedy  dorothy lamour of a general store in a dying native community dead river get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths listen to george kennedy waffle and waffle on for 10 minutes about how hes committed to his great community what a nice touchy feely time well just like kennedys speeches this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when the indian comes alive and turns avenger the goons meet a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion the effects were commendably done but what about that free flowing hair how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back ugh  second story the raft follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water now this is much better much better what starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy setup thats full of tight and claustrophobic tension and it doesnt even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark gornicks direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side while the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords the sludgelike creature in the lake like many have mentioned looks like an icky black tarpaulin yeah youre reading that right floating on the water  finally number three concludes with the hitchhiker a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo but shes is running late thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed she skids off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker instead of checking or getting help she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough shes being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhikernot awful but i really didnt get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired the vivid makeup effects are welldisplayed and dripping with vision when she hits the hitchhiker thats when it becomes hectic cheesy and overthetop in its execution from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this happens every time she decides to run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling in all the second short story the raft and the unpleasantly wellconceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel

1,i watch them allits not better than the amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we dance japanese version but its completely respectable and pleasingly different in partsi am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting for example the name should scream dont watch how she move since when can movie titles ignore grammar there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar its just not canadian standard english grammar comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because im a canadian standard english speaker so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it it wasnt all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so americani loved that this movie was set in toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance moviesin summary if you tend to like dance movies then this is a decent one if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie
1,this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy but profane woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero sound familiar there are plenty of holes in this story things just dont add up and some of the suspense is a little corny but  that suspense is very good there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it the story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way making it an involving movie for the viewer thats why i give it a pretty good rating  the movie gets you involved in it bullock is more cute than annoying which she normally is to me so this is my highestrated movie with her in it

1,paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film ive ever seen often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some journo once called it the thinking persons nightmare on elm street and while i accept the logic of his conclusion i cant help but think its a tag that is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate theyre really not thinking at all in fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea quite simply paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart as someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing to be honest i make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste stop reading now because theres more to come its so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood often overlooked in a seamless and convincing way and yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away add to all this an incredibly talented director bernard rose imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack youre ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why i have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express

0,i wont go and give them my 10 bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best at least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing i have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original and she thinks jessica simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all and since when is american pie have anything to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car that in itself should have gotten the movie a r rating the only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals lets all hope so the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked

1,this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat fraidy cats previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different eras in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number 9 and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy i watched this movie almost every day as a child o
0,first off the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which i dont understand how was missed  you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film the first time i saw it i just said well mistakes happen and brushed it off after about the 10th time it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny if you havent seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the microphone might make for pretty interesting gamenow about the film this movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid ghost story however the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely you begin watching the movie under the assumption alluded by the tv commercials that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger the opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film spoiler the movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force in the home the idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar the young boy also witnesses this supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed after his family is killed the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as wellas i said this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a twoyearold this began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well completely ruining the only children can see illusion set forth by the commercials and opening sceneregardless of this the movie didnt actually get ruined until the plot twist at the end in which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie all of a sudden after being attacked by a swarm of crows the man snaps and tries to kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his family which he killed at the beginningthe whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf first why was the familys souls trapped in a house if the director was going for a juon the grudge approach in which the family after dying in a fit of rage would haunt the house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting stop after the father was captured by the ghosts of his family if the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them why were they attacking the new family heres another one for you it takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest this tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie was living on the property for months during all this time why didnt the ghosts just go kill him this movie included a lot of clichd horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies however im telling ya this movie still couldve pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end its like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending for this movie to have been a success they shouldve stuck with the only children can see them premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning wouldve opened the door for possible sequeltoo

1,i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction the way it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very interestingthe portuguese the japanese and the various communities being managed by the king the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason the wardrobe is fine the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective

1,the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous selfdesctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh atsympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked bestsimon geist is a man in his late 30searly 40s who creates a popculture driven editorial magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitchslap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his livein female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the musicvideo queen for a bunch of brated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if youre in the indieart house crowd mark my words
0,if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others  can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable  im from georgia and have friends from texas  believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment

1,i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a family get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an ex pat she was very antibritish she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film a long days dying its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end

0,speck was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck there is however not much killing to be found in this movie and none of it is explicitly shown the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub yet even this is merely implied and not shown save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr specks leg the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voiceover which should be a testament to the mindnumbingly boring nature of this movie every aspect of this movie is horrible unless you have a fondness for boredom dont bother this movie only clocks in at 72 minutes but it feels like an eternity
0,this movie started out as a quite decentlooking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didnt manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all its supposed to be a horror movie but there wasnt a single scene that was close to frightening or even excitingto be frank the actors werent all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysoverall a watchable movie but it doesnt add anything and once youve finished ; watching it it wont last long until its already forgottenthe reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it 4 out of 10 if you still want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch juon instead
0,i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel violated i had read the reviews and heard the warnings and i thought i was prepared for anything  at best i thought a faithful if misguided attempt at an original adaptation at worst a sogooditsbad plan 9 for the new millennium so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk i joked to my friends prepare for the worst movie ever made oh cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film the special effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx81 the acting is terrible the accents are worse than terrible one artillery mans accent seems to take us on a tour of the british isles from scotland to wales via northern ireland the dialogue is stilted the editing is nonexistent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words really cannot describe how bad this movie is from the union flag flying from the horribly cgid thunderchild the royal navy flies the white ensign not the union flag to the woodworm ridden acting this is quite simply a crime against film making when you consider some of the literallyzerobudget fan films that are available on the net the star wars short troops for example the whole were enthusiastic amateurs argument goes right out of the window and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website this film had an 8 figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the problem is that hines  co tried to make a film of the book rather than turn the book into a film if that makes any sense characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words ironically enough the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers the exsoft porn actress my advice pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesnt screw up and go watch the spielberg version it may not be true to the text of the book but i can say this as a lifelong hg wells fan and englishman as well speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i want them back

1,this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that is bad it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character consequently if you are not into tragedies this is not your movie it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile if you liked dostoyevskys crime and punishment you will probably like this if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the movie prompts is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publiclyaproved ideas for another set the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quoif you are a conservative you will not like this movie besides other philosophical questions i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start also there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters if these sorts of things do not impress you skip it overall i give this movie a 7

1,"ah classic comedy at the point in the movie where brains get messed together a two minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole moviefor years and years bruce campbell knows what : kind of movies we want out of him we want to see weird movies like bubba ho tep we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies and we want to see man with the screaming brain with the title alone one knows that its going to border that : completely silly type of movie like army of darkness only with more silly and less monstersthe idea of the movie is simple bruce sees doctor doctor has new idea bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor coincidentally its the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him hilarity ensueswith the addition of ted raimi as a weird russian guy and journeyman stacy keach as dr ivan ivanovich ivanov its funny that does this movie complete funny , never a point of scaryif you like the silly bruce campbell youll like this then again why would you be watching this if you didnt like bruce campbell"
1,gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a trivialityand to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as dramabut i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years immensely sympathetic performance from jared harriss who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charismahopefully without poor richards penchant for hellraising and haminessand charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer radiant location photography including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to lifeand making magic in the dark
0,at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles setthe plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of thingsor just a lot was edited from the movie the characters identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning  in other words  they had things within the movie that didnt seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the moviei suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they hadif they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didnt so now theres a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opiniondont waste your time or money
0,"shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a ! sense of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care ! about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom dieok so if you cant be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a : war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they . are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says : so . yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbfine fine there is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no in fact many of the fights arent even fights at all super ninjas ? that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion im talking about things like lalala im , walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not even halfway through ? the film i threw my hands ; up in frustration at the ludicrousness ; of it"
0,after just 15 minutes into this film i began to miss zhang yimous earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin im sure my opinion is different from many others as im coming from a different background smmf like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and its certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no sword  sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story all 3 the butterfly murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck theres an air of superiority with this film thats really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase ie an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasnt extended past her ability to play a naive witch shes so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though shes reading her lines from a notecard its so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest theyre tricked into thinking its brilliant filmmaking ching siu tungs choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if theres subparobvious wirework then you probably shouldnt have filmed it at high speed the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct bmovie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though theres a little pilot inside i know that logic doesnt really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you dont want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu its obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did after watching hero and smmf ive come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films hes definitely off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero was bad

0,robert altmans downbeat newfangled western from edmund naughtons book mccabe was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the characters here dont merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally brackish and unappealing bearded warren beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel once the profits start coming in beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place but the action in this sorry little town is limitedmost of the story being made up of vignettesand altmans pacing is deliberately slow theres hardly a statement being made just the opposite in fact and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds its a selfdefeating picture and yet in an altmanquirky way it wears defeat proudly  from

0,i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews after seeing the trailer i thought  what an unfunny movie full of clichs but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often dont portray the movie very well what a waste of time the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it i couldnt recall one single line that made me laugh the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies but that also is pretty pass i couldnt relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because i found them utterly stupid the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally
1,midnight cowboy is not for everybody its raw painful and realistic but very entertaining the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances voight as the texas hustler joe buck who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women sadly buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas he was raised by his grandmother sally buck played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in 1969 from cancer the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and bucks characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job as the film evolves bucks past comes to the surface and its haunting but not clear the film is not for children but compared to todays films and television programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i cant forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you cant forget its also a tearjerker of a film so get your hankies out too

1,", roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our ; time as the mind behind classics such . as rosemarys baby and chinatown probably what makes polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of ? making lowkey movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horrorsuspense story about paranoia and obsession that ; is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever donepolanski himself plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to ! become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the buildingwhile sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartmentthemed , films repulsion  rosemarys baby this film . focuses on . the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovskys head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenanttrelkovskys descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that ! way as a simpleton with ! almost no life who traps himself in this maddening subworld that . happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the filmalso the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives . life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling . of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractiveif a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turnoff but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovskys own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex , layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to ! face a thoughtprovoking plot like this onewhile ; the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one ? of roman polanksis masterpieces 1010"

0,i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent bgrade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial 911 sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful  the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess 110

1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller
0,i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violencethree tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes that alone didnt sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 timesthere was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like a 45 minute boys brief short rather than a fleshed out fulllength film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its partsthe 1st part boxerstalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their catmouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lotlocker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want the 2nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he jacksoff tony doesnt seem to mind but he doesnt even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby  not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the allimportant transition from im a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be gay and hitting him because id like to spread his ass and do him sm style a very important thing to leave outclearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time the 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the makeup bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent showthere wasnt enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic the film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously

0,no its not the horror moviethis one is actually a love storythe ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them she loves the boxer known as one round jack she loves him until the champion comes along that is even though she marries one round she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between one round and the champion she comes back to one rounds corner just when things look their bleakest and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love backthis film was very early in hitchs career but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film although there are special film tricks and some comedy relief this film just does not hold up to any of his later work it must have been extremely risqu for the time period though with the shameless adulterous wife that may have been the draw back in 1927 while looking through all of these old films it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on todays screen and really come off maybe i should be the oneskip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcocks films you could fall asleep in the middle

1,roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemarys baby and chinatown probably what makes polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making lowkey movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horrorsuspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever donepolanski himself plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the buildingwhile sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartmentthemed films repulsion  rosemarys baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovskys head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenanttrelkovskys descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening subworld that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the filmalso the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractiveif a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turnoff but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovskys own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking plot like this onewhile the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of roman polanksis masterpieces 1010

0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genresetting horror films of the 1930s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the 19th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage  as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray costarred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poorquality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later
0,renowned cinematographer freddie francis glory the elephant man directs this pretty bad horrordrama film 19th century england has a different view of how the practice of medicine should be handled than dr thomas rock the law stating that only the bodies of hung criminals can be studied and experimented on but the stockpile of these bodies is a small one and rock needs more  and he prefers them fresher being a maverick within his circle he begins to pay people to find bodies for him to study and test on desperate sleazebags robert fallon and timothy broom get wind of this job opportunity and begin to murder people and sell these bodies to rock naturally this kind of action has even worse consequences than practicing on the dead bodies of noncriminals and leads to trouble for everyone while the overall story sounds intriguing on paper almost everything about the doctor and the devils is laughably badafter the first fifteen minutes of the film you are already beginning to question your decision of sitting down to watch the film the entire look of the film is just ugly seeing as how the film takes place in the slums of england during the 19th century the filmmakers were probably going for an ugly look but they dont do it in an artful way everything from the sets to the cinematography just look cheap feeble and disgusting also just about everything scene is filled with something that you simply cannot take seriously and most of the time this has to do with someone both in the small and large roles doing something that looks or sounds completely ridiculous francis sure didnt help out his actors muchjonathan pryce and stephen rea play the twisted buddies of the film fallon and broom respectively and are very bombastic but very bad their characters are by nature crazy but pryce and rea overact the parts to death they especially have trouble keeping the same accent from shot to shot  pryce in particular goes from cockney to irish to long john silver to some kind of lagoon creature and so on and so forth its also a humor riot to see twiggy in this film at all let alone playing an indemand street whore since she cant act to save her life though her song during the final credits isnt so funny boy she sure came a long way from flower power to ill take mee clothes off for a shillin as bad as those three actors are in this film julian sands takes home the award for the worst performance of the film he is just as lame as it gets giving one laughoutloud attempt after another at portraying anger love happiness anxiety  pick an emotion any emotion theres only one good thing about the doctor and the devils timothy daltons performance of dr rock despite being surrounded by cinematic sewage dalton is quite excellent giving an electric portrayal of an overly driven yet good natured man too bad the rest of the film could not have been as good as mr dalton

1,"the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in : the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a slow moody but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion the film will not be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it okin the early moments of the film we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if theyre lucky while climbing through a barbed wire fence the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him the gun through the fence the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fenceanyway once his brother is killed 12yrold arnold regresses into his own world he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family seems to shun him perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold even though the older brothers death allows him to hit on the kids girlfriend arnolds parents dont seem to understand how to deal with their son they really dont even try to talk to him ? about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after a while arnold even moves in with the old timernothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncles exwife once he meets her he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the familys . turmoil with the accident from here on the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation , and reawakeningthe acting is hauntingly distant in most cases robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newmans performance in hud the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody pictures about common folk this one may be for you some even may be advised to bring some tissues 8 of 10 starsthe hound"

0,hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap reinvented over and over again take superheroes for example for each xman and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of mr gore verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman based horrors eg the ring 2 the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudgesthe first grudge wasnt entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge 2 is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge 2 the critic goes the same waytired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichs all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dullthe chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldnt enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesnt that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day its getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood bullshits

0,this is a review of the later english release by disney featuring alison lohman patrick stewart and co i really wanted this film to be good really really im a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films boast wellcrafted plots 3dimensional characters and the best film music sincewellever this film just doesnt come closemight as well start w the positive aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasyscifi setting in a postapocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazakis later films and the english voice acting is quite well donebut this filmjustisntgood the characters are all cardboard  from saccharine sweet little nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians to everyone in between once youve seen each of them for 30 seconds youve seen all there is and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesnt helpthen theres the music now hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but nausicaa doesnt do him justice half the music is 80s keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picturebut wait theres a great message with this film right lets all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree no really i aint kiddingit makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you whats going on thats lameif youre the kind of person who worships anime enjoys 80s music and plants a tree every arbor day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time

1,first of all i need to say that im portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even noneand the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when leo da estrela e costa do castelo were among the worlds best of their time with movies like pulsao zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in commonthis one is also good not of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy in fact its officially a drama a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid the plot works and can surprise us a few times the actors are fine the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenixif you want to watch a portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills one to be measured

1,i got to see the movie  on thin ice on the television in india i must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addictedhowever i felt that diane keaton was at her best the scene where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine was the best the two boys are good and lynda boyd also showed what a good actress she isthe script is well done as is the cinematography and direction and castinga must must watch movie for everyone
0,its unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases ie anger at the gay characters thinking french thrillers are bad etc i will admit that im unfamiliar with the novel but as a film after about 45 minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the 2 hours of its running length2 hours that felt like 3 dont get me wrong i can sit through hour and a half silent films 3 hour epics i dont have a short attention span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery list of complaints first off the ending yes it had a scoobydooesquire character explains everything at the end now i actually think for this movie this was necessary the film had so many plottwists emotional revelations new facts surfacing and being discovered one reviewer said it well yes it is a very logical story but without the very essential back story their childhood stories the relationship amongst the 3 parents the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man it just doesnt feel right i felt cheated  i wont throw in too many spoilers here i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary but according to the reviews on here theres a lot of people who seem to really love this so i dont want to give anything away i personally cant stand soap operas the complexity and twists and turns for me snuffed out any impact the final revelations could possibly deliver by the end i seriously didnt care there werent any gaping plot holes necessarily this seems like it could make a great book in writing it is perfectly logical but if im supposed to believe this is reality something doesnt sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted too often i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot increase the emotion and develop the mystery the acting i had no complaints about the directing eh not bad but the plot and especially its development severely lacking sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller but i couldnt get into it i gave this a 3 simply because i dont want to seem completely unfair and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement major spoiler and i have to mention it but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldnt fit in another twist your father didnt die in a hunting accident i almost died when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasnt enough does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as much as ive ever been bothered in any film
1,"not all but most : of this story is buster being mistaken for : dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and ; his comedic timing the 27minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop  and father : a girl buster is interested in  who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the ! hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half ? hour that makes little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think 85 , years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool"

0,"wow just wow never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in 20 minutes and then i happened to come upon lady frankenstein this movie takes everything you know about frankenstein and turns it completely upside down and not in a good way if youve seen this movie , you either stumbled across it on italian tv or you have the dubbed version on the 50 chilling classics box set like i have as number 24 and lets just say theres a reason why these movies are here because theyre not very good enough of that though onto the movieit starts out with dr frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant whosobviously not igor for some reason his college graduate daughter  shows up and states how she just graduated with a medical degree cause yeah there were so many female doctors back then so she states how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no and then he makes the monster and it kills him so she grieves for exactly 7 seconds and then makes up a story with the assistant how it was a burglar the monster escapes and goes on a rampage ok i really cant believe they killed dr frankenstein so early in the movie he dies like20 minutes in and then his daughter takes over which doesnt make a whole lot of sense but sure so lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster whos now rampagingis to make another monster oh yes how i love her logic so her new monster she gets the body by killing someone and putting the brain of the assistant in iti know just nod and go along with it so the monsters meet and duke it out i love how the assistant asks why dont we just let the mobs kill it and she answers with they wouldnt know how to kill it and in the end he kills it with an axe to the head haha oh yeah nobody else could have figured that one out so in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein the endthis movie was justweird it was seriously like somebody wrote a self insert fanfic theres no other way to describe this movie there were some odd naked scenes too like this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend the monster picks up the girl and the guy drives away haha nice guy she then struggles a bit and dies fromto be quite honest i really dont know what she died from but whatever its lady frankenstein it doesnt have to make sense this movie had a lot of those why moments to the point that i just gave up movies shouldnt do that but for some reason i see that more than i probably should so final word its not the worst movie ive seen on this pack but its a ! tad boring and full of many many holes and random things so lady frankenstein gets 3 frankenstein porn scenes out of 10"
0,this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is utterly disgusting somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black mans vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies arent a complete waste of time but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny except jack nicholson who is a good actor the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs im surprised its gotten such a high rating on imdb

0,". so i rented this movie , hoping to ? learn about the democratic republic of ? congo drc ! and ? the beginnings of ; its independence , from belgian rule i was ! excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly lumumba . and mobutu : i wanted . to see : how the new congolese government ! attempted to bring together the various groups ? opposing colonial rule , the : political , motives ? behind each one the ; reasons behind belgiums decision to give the ? drc its independence and also how the : united states , and ? the former ? ussr were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my : belief is , that this movie was made . by : people ? who through a passing ? familiarity with the story of the ; drcs ! fight for freedom ; saw a story filled . with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they , then proceeded to try and : stuff all the dramatic points ; into a storyline briefly filled ! them ! out with ! dialogue went to . the set and shot ; it , i ? could be wrong but if so its , all the ? sadder because ! then ? the makers must have simply become too tied up in , getting , everything , in and ended up glossing over ; all details in an . effort to create an encompassing history whatever ; the reason the fact is that the movie could be a timeline , of . sentencelong statements and , facts printed . on the screen the film goes through ; each major occurrence and tells . the viewer pointblank the main ? idea of whats going on completely , smoothing over the actual . details in , favor of getting across ; the big things for , instance , there is ! the scene when lumumba : is captured by ! the ; increasingly . rebellious , army controlled , by mobutu ! in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with lumumba ? one that vilifies ? lumumba and one that stands ! in ? the . middle sympathizing and yet obeying ; orders correspondingly there are three soldiers that speak in the ? scene . uttering ? lines that unadornedly show their ! points : of view then to avoid ; dealing with the actual , tensions . that these opposing viewpoints bring up the , scriptwriters simply : inserted some : random shooting more army , guys show up ; and they just end up beating everyone up this is the ? extent ; of , the reflectiveness of the movie most of ; the ! time each character ! simply states their basic ; motives : the other characters , respond with theirs and thats that theres little ? telling through actions , even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness , its hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also ; in the trend , of this directness . things , like political tension ? between factions is reduced ? to simple acknowledgement of ! the fact ; we never learn ! what these ? factions are what theyre fighting ; for their power basically anything except that they exist : the characters likewise are onedimensional and flat unfortunately : i ! dont , know whether ! lumumba was actually a freedom fighter ; passionately devoted ; to ideals of congolese unity but after : an hour or so of the movie , i ? certainly didnt trust it ? to tell . me so the drc like many developing countries has , a complicated ? and important history ! especially in the period leading up to and : after independence but the , telling of these histories , will ? not be useful unless there : is recognition . of the : intricacy of ; the situations , lumumba : fails to give , proper attention ; to these details and : ends ! up telling . the ? viewer little except the most general of outlines"

0,daft potboilers dont come much dafter than this but its a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright except in this case it doesnt based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas he wrote the robe and already filmed in 1935 with irene dunne and robert taylor its got more uplift than a cantilever brarock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it no it sint quite that daft he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy in between times they fall in lovetry as i might i cant quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirks films this one isnt too deep on the plus side rock hudson isnt half bad i think i am rediscovering him and of course it looks great in sirks films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soapopera terms this is definitely daytime tv

1,but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did its a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins its uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although its not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street lifeperhaps weird al isnt recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is a funny movie
0,"i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violencethree tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes that alone didnt sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 timesthere was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like a 45 minute . boys brief , short rather than a fleshed out fulllength film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its partsthe 1st part boxerstalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their catmouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lotlocker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want the 2nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he jacksoff tony doesnt seem to mind but he doesnt even appear , interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby  not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the allimportant transition from im a ; straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i : might be gay and hitting him because id like to spread his ass and do him sm style a very . important thing to leave outclearly these stories each could have conveyed their ! points in half the time the ? 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore . it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the makeup bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent showthere wasnt enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic the film made no statement squandered time and is not . engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it : ultimately impossible to take seriously"
1,i dont know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie ive seen in many years the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that im amazed they kept having more options like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes things like malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for foreign affairslike the word utenriks many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and probably not in french either so the translators must have made up their own jokes and done so very well of course they have a very good base to build on with a film thats simply comical from beginning to endrecommended in all languages with a good translation

0,a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demons seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with its sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the end

1,i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is ! sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy

0,oh my god i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i downloaded this movie seeing as 1903 was one of my fave years for movies ever but it sucked the plot although id hesitate to call it that is about some dumb elephant it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets electrocuted to death lame even for a short film the plot was too thin to keep my attention edison is like the worst director ever plus the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending wow that wasnt predictable at all sarcasmthe picture quality is horrible too you can barely tell whats going on most of the time the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other unscary horror flicks this didnt spawn eleven sequels other than that this is a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life youll never get back

0,again were getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films the good and the bad son story courtesy east of eden the american marine hero story who doesnt consider himself to be one due to what he knows and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man storythe mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isnt so much of a problem though because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around no luck this time though as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the sameas the bad son never really gets to talk to his father so that conflict is never resolved properly apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife now how satisfying is thatnext the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved because he never really talks to the man under suspicion namely his own brother so once more were handed a loose end hereand finally the american military heroism hypocrisy theme where the marine is publicly considered a hero when due to the dirtiness of war he went through he shouldnt really be called one as to his own standards that third theme falls flat just the same because the movie ends right when for the first time hes just able to talk to his wife about what he went through where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely his process of recovery how that would look like and how he would finally face the family hed have some major guilt to admit to all that all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignoredso while story wise this film is a serious and i mean serious disappointment id still give it points for the impressive cast although no film should use maguire for a voice over because that belongs to spiderman especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor so much that id in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profileso while the cast really seems to do what they can i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise a shallow and ultimately pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed message du jour to the writers we know the wounds already see the host of vietnam films you want to earn some credit show us a believable healing
0,the evil that men do 1984 was one of the few noncannon films charlie bronson made during the 80s unlike most of the cannon films charlie starred in this one wasnt fun or entertaining charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half if you thought he was mr emotion before wait until you see this in this one charlie goes to an unnamed central american country and shows the populace that whoever messes with chuck or his people have to pay the piper this one is no fun its not cheesy or campy just brutal sadistic and not in a good way i didnt like this one i have no love for this film no recommendations because its not worth watching maybe if they didnt cut the hell out of it watch with precautiondont bother

0,pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie and that is precisely what happened herefirst off let me admit i am yet to play ffvii i intend to order it soon however i did do research to familiarise myself with the characters and the story however not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this and advent children demands that knowledge of ffvii is requiredin spite of incredible visuals i cant say there is too much thats new weve seen it in final fantasy the spirits within and apart from some better movement i cant say theyve done lots of superdaring stuff with thisthe fight scenes  well they are a bit of fun still how could we ever doubt the result of any of them this one was boringly classic  there were three fights with the bad guys following the standard procedure the hero cloud gets smashed then he almost gets there and gets smashed and then finally wins the reason i say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal but in this case is poorly executed ill touch on that laterthe english dub seemed fine to me though i didnt watch it in japanese so i shant judge the japanese dub but only the english one ill say this  ive heard plenty of better ones even in my limited repertoireand now the plot ummm what plot let me be frank this movie is nought but a fan service a chance to see the ffvii characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy as i said earlier the fights seem to just happen for no reason the opening fight is never explained kadaj seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty cloud sits around moping for the entire film and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameoreally ffvii was an ensemble piece advent children is anything but if theyd managed to give everyone some significant story role star trek first contact proved it was possible i might add then this could have been a lot better naturally that would have changed the plot too which lets be honest is almost set to be better than the one we gotcharacters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten the members of avalanche thats the group cloud worked with in ffvii for those who dont know get 2 scenes 3 in the case of vincent valentine and some get even less hell the bad guys get more lines than these guys and that is pretty badthe music well i dont care if nobuo uematsu is god himself he botched this film big time advent one winged angel was the only decent piece otherwise he couldnt decide whether to be epic and orchestral or fun with electric guitar when he switched from one to the other you felt it as though hed taken a sledgehammer to your headand that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun it tried to be both and failed miserably honestly you cant please everyone and do everything the movie also tried to be deep you can go epic and deep or fun and deep but all three is too much but failed here too the last scene which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it you dont need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there that scene just didnt belong in the film and nor did aeriths frequent appearances  shes dead jimgiven just how fantastic ive heard final fantasy vii to be this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment because of the beautiful visuals i give it a 2 out of 10

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late 1950s known as the french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest ; of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character ? relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate ! approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important

1,not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like farscape doesi know youngsters and 3040 years oldfans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this tv miniseries it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on tv character driven drama that could be from an australian soap opera yet in the same episode it has science fact  fiction that would give even the hardiest trekkie a run for his money in the brainbender stakes wormhole theory time travel in true equational formmagnificent it embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose fromwith such a broad scope it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long but here is where farscape really comes into its own elementit succeeds where all others have failed especially the likes of star trek a universe with practically zero kaos element they ran out of ideas pretty quickly  kept rehashing them over the course of 4 seasons they manage to keep the audiences attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues i happened to see the pilot premiere in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever get the girl after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd  i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst i had to do a 12 hour night shift and developed chronic insomniafarscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nightsdo yourself a favour watch the pilot and see what i meanfarscape comet

0,this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0 an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time

0,oh boy films like this really bother me if this movie is supposed to close to truth then i assume that rommel knew hitler for a time before wwii started in the movie rommel mentions how hitler had changed from before well i cant imagine that rommel wouldnt have known something about hitlers government policies so rommel must share some guilt for the german atrocities with that in mind i have a problem with a movie that makes rommels life at the end a tragic one he made his choices and we have to feel bad for him i cant do it i also cant buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to fight the war the allies would have had more trouble winning it if more competent people were in charge wwii may never have started in the first place from a movie watching aspect the film jumps from place to place and most of the time seems like a history special with big name actors playing the historical roles leo g carroll has a couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke english without the ridiculous accents but other than that not very essential

1,well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didnt see any humor he doesnt even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalobut i didnt think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area  disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesnt make the story funny back in the 1950s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies whats so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox diehard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldnt wear it and viceversamaybe to someone who doesnt follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut its a fact of life or any bittime sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laughthe art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltins animation favorites from the national film board of canada

0,that someone could have conceived this nonsense and then got it produced is incredible that it actually aired on television and advertisers actually paid to be associated with it is mind boggling this stomachwrenching excuse for kids programming is almost too vile to comment on ive burned  yes burned  any barney tapes that people have given my son to find this awful programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise and where tell me where do they get those smarmy kid actors have their parents no sense those kids will be on drugs before theyre teenagers geez the final insult is that i have to add this extra line to the review to get it on imdb
1,with a film starring the twins ekin cheng and edison chen nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of hollywoodstyle vampires no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment and jackie chansure the kungfu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure the script reminds you of blade and sure the whole affair is instantly forgettablebut for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would be hard pushed to find better
1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example . and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about . checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score 7 out of 10

0,corben bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters we watch as the staff at a radio station takes reportsits has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood there are some really good ideas here but they just dont work actually the films ideas are better handled in a film called pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap given the choice id watch pontypool again rather than watch this film again
1,hilarious film i had a great time watching it the star cuneyt arkin sometimes credited as steve arkin is a popular actor from turkey he has played in lots of toughguy roles epicsword films and romances it was fun to see him with an international cast and some real lousy looking pair of gloves if i remember it was also dubbed in english which made things even more funnier kinda like seeing john wayne speak turkish
0,first of all season 1 is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional theyre nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchairbound augustus hill who is played impressively by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with whats taking place in the showunfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a mens club with guards guards that dont do much near the end of season two an older prisoners grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of 20 and 50 bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even adibisi wanted to be nice but thats okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distractionlater shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators lets see what else shillingers son ods in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he justgot them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise youll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums i didnt know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr farajs schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and oreilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a guni shouldnt go on about stupid ideas in this show but its like a flood i cant stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who cant speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless theyre needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robsons gum transplant whats the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesnt belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again its like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mindi also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they dont say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you dont think im gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience wont remember maybe im spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a lowbudget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multiseason tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i dont understand myself
1,i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual  a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that cant be undone and the need for others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe ill eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but ive never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and im glad i saw it as a child
0,"i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point the guy being awake during the surgery had nothing to do with the outcome it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didnt think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table give me a break jessica alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish im fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with , a scalpel you would be in more pain than that"

0,im so confused ive been a huge seagal fan for 25 years ive seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times i can only describe this film as bizarre steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin whiny imposters voice no less what i also dont get is if they had to dub some of his lines why does his own voice appear on the rest of them i expect seagal to age like the rest of us but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger confidence bravado charm and sexappeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky selfassured attitude and his badass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin where is that inyourface attitude and charm that made him such a huge star i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us  if so his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone
1,a hugely enjoyable screen version of rona jaffes bestselling potboiler about the trials and tribulations and naturally the loves of a group of women involved in one way or another in the new york publishing business directed by jean negulesco fairly fresh from the success of three coins in a fountain and the prototype for the likes of sex and the city except that here the sex all takes place offscreenthe bright young female talents of the day hope lange diane baker suzy parker martha hyer are all nicely cast while joan crawford pops up as a queen bitch of an editor who could probably eat meryl streeps miranda priestly and spit her out with absolutely no effort at all she steals the movie the men include stephen boyd louis jourdan if it wasnt rossano brazzi it had to be louis jourdan robert evans before he decided wisely to go behind the camera and brian aherne there are more suds on display than you will find in your average launderette but if like me you enjoy desperate housewives not to mention carrie bradshaw and company then you will probably love this a very guilty pleasure

1,"i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ? ago i watched it for what it was a collection of music videos its not a movie it doesnt have a plot nor a central storyline its a rather artistic anthology of mostly longform videos all of them rather smartly or creatively done michael jackson may be considered a freak these ! days but after , all this was the ? man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set trends with ; billie jean and beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to , create some vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects live performance footage and even selfparody the badder sequence and for those wondering what : joe pesci was doing there . this video came out just a tad before he became a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal : sequence the choreographed section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point"

1,not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the 27minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our heroearlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop  and father a girl buster is interested in  who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestits just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think 85 years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
1,s epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr marcus franklin while growing up under the guardianship of nanny the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture lifes ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def macy gray terrence dashon howard rosie perez louis gossett jr liev schreiber jimmy smits ernie hudson delroy lindo and patricia wettig loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson

0,shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom dieok so if you cant be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbfine fine there is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no in fact many of the fights arent even fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion im talking about things like lalala im walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not even halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it
0,unfortunately i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango since i am a scifi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested meinstead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick appropriate for an audience of likeminded individuals but very unchristian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions shame on you at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wildeyed crazinessso this bgrade movie and i am being kind production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth groups but if you are a mainline christian or nonchristian you will not be comfortable

1,the first film ever made workers streaming from a factory some cycling most walking moving right or left along with melies the lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema  with melies begins narrative fiction cinema fantasy artifice spectacle with the lumieres pure unadorned observation the truth there are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the formerbut consider this short again there is nothing objective about it the film is full of action  a static inhuman scene burst into life activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured decentred from the back to right or left but never of course the front where the camera is and yet the camera stands stock still contains the energy the possible subversion subordinates it to its will the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention but it will be used for conservative purposes  to map out the world edit it restrict it limit itworse is the historical reality of the film these factory workers are lumiere employees the bosses are spying on their workers the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions the film therefore describes two types of imprisonment behind the gates the workers are confined in their workplace the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom escape but they face another wall the fourth wall further confining them the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance an image of unseen allseeing authority entrapping its servants a frightening all too prophetic movie

1,the opening shot of the consequences of love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film a travellator slowly carries a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera trailing a huge suitcase behind him like the central character in the film we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him his profession the contents of the suitcase could be way off the markconsequences of love is that kind of film from the title you might expect a bergmanesq dissection of a relationship what we have instead is a lead character titta living life in emotional exile seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him if the film can be classified in any way i would call it a mystery as we are engaged in working out who titta is and what he is about what we know from the start is he is 50ish cool composed and expensively attired he has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking swiss hotel always paying his room fee on time but seldom showing any interest in the staff or other guestshis only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with the couple it transpires used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have only the room they live in left their love of money antiques and each other was their undoing and titta seems to identify with their plight he once had it all but now is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel his brother a long haired surf instructor drops in to see him occasionally but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure they talk about the person titta considers to be his best friend even though he hasnt seen him for 25 years this long lost friend is now a telephone engineer repairing the communication network that brings so many together meanwhile tittas phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to speak to himmidway through the film titta makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up to a young barmaid from the hotel with his judgement clouded by emotion he sets himself on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for goodthe slow unfolding of tittas fall from grace is and beautifully scripted shot and scored the thumping techno soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more secrets are revealed the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as titta lets his mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions the ending with a visual nod to felini is dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the audience to once more question his motivespatrick bliss 010606
1,i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ago i watched it for what it was a collection of music videos its not a movie it doesnt have a plot nor a central storyline its a rather artistic anthology of mostly longform videos all of them rather smartly or creatively done michael jackson may be considered a freak these days but after all this was the man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set trends with billie jean and beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects live performance footage and even selfparody the badder sequence and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there this video came out just a tad before he became a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the choreographed section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point

0,this movie started out as a quite decentlooking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didnt manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all its supposed to be a horror movie but there wasnt a single scene that was close to frightening or even excitingto be frank the actors werent all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysoverall a watchable movie but it doesnt add anything and once youve finished watching it it wont last long until its already forgottenthe reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it 4 out of 10 if you still want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch juon instead

0,so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule the political motives behind each one the reasons behind belgiums decision to give the drc its independence and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing familiarity with the story of the drcs fight for freedom saw a story filled with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them out with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so its all the sadder because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history whatever the reason the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentencelong statements and facts printed on the screen the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main idea of whats going on completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things for instance there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with lumumba one that vilifies lumumba and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying orders correspondingly there are three soldiers that speak in the scene uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view then to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and thats that theres little telling through actions even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness its hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also in the trend of this directness things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact we never learn what these factions are what theyre fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the characters likewise are onedimensional and flat unfortunately i dont know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didnt trust it to tell me so the drc like many developing countries has a complicated and important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines

1,a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top 10 actors certainly of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the 1970s hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian
0,the comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable sadly this version falls far shortthe casting is uninspired and the acting wooden one gets the impression the director did not read the bookso did not understand the characterssir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured in the 1995 version is nowhere to be foundthe musgrove sisters are so unlikable one doesnt understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glancethe relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feelingin the 1995 version hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions in this one it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the bookthis production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters relationshipin the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast it seems to the viewer as mary thinks they are only slight acquaintancesin the 1995 version when wentworth walks in the first time he sees her in years the tension is thick resentment is coming off wentworth in waves while anne is almost overcomein this version while wentworth is courting lousia it is as if he is truly invested the undercurrents are missing in the 1995 version the viewer sees wentworths anger at anne he is flaunting his courtship in front of anne as if to say see what you gave up i dont need or want you anymoreyet he still cares if she suffers as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates in the 1995 version the viewer feels annes shock that he would care if she was tired we also feel wentworths discomfort that he does still care in this version he just walks on with lousia as if nothing happenedthe pivotal scene where anne is conversing with harville about who loves longest man or woman is totally botched the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investmentwhen anne reads the letter from wentworth it is as if she is reading a grocery listcontrast this to the 1995 version where the viewer feels annes joy at her second chance we are there with her as she reads the letter the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices wentworth is full of frustration passion and hope while annes is at first incredulous then evolves in to joythis production has more scenes after the revelation probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened the 1995 version didnt need to explain we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in its favor is it kept the mrs smith sub plot intact while the 1995 version did notthe 1995 version however did include part of austens original ending the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr elliot will want to move back to her house which he  mrs croft are renting after they marry this is a production to avoid at all costs

0,blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle kristin erickson is found wandering around covered in dogs blood her parents ely randy colton  blanche leslie flemingmitchell own the ranch  are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself  is considered a danger to herself  others ranch hand  expriest miguel del zamora recognises isabelles symptoms as a possible case of possession  when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it blanche calls priest jacob cameron daddo who is her other daughter claires madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he confirms miguels suspicions  accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle  an innocent girl freedirected by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism  i kept asking the same question over  over again why do i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total  utter unashamed ripoff of the exorcist 1973  you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share theres the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny  suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past misdemeanours against others the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctors the priest with a troubled past  the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different other than its total crap is that it tries to give all the characters some screen time  tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but its so badly written  acted it just ends up being boring the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the characters are poorly written  fleshed out at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof theres a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers  after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof  serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at leastaccording to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on actual events yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called the exorcist this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest there isnt even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up theres a scene of a cut arm theres a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix  thats about it theres surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breasts are seen one pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere  a really amateurish feel to the whole film toowith a supposed budget of about 1000000 i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly  cheap throughout there are no special effects to speak of  the production values are rock bottom the acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache  a terrible accent he is better than thisblackwater valley exorcism is a complete ripoff of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic  the makers are thirty five years too late anyway a total turkey from start to finish

0,roger corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious lowbudget career spanning over 300 movies while few if any would call him great his films obscure connections to underground culture via reference tribute or influence have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts throughout his career he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films piranha humanoids from the deep the black scorpion etc without improving on them in the slightest raptor written and directed by jay andrews jim wynorski the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures chopping mall takes that practice to a disturbing new low regarding cormans mid90s carnosaur trilogy wynorskis credits are in quotes because raptor isnt a tribute to the carnosaur films and not even a remake raptor is the carnosaur films or at least the films dinosaurinduced death scenes haphazardly spliced together with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes many of which consist of dinos eye view shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious the new material was written around the footage instead of vice versa and is totally unremarkable with huge gaps of logic eg two separate teams are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts 2 and 3 where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the carnosaur films already the actors lack of any feeling in their characters though in fairness any character dimension is only presented in the script once maybe twice brings to mind the terribly wooden acting in 1950s bfilms and it certainly doesnt make anything between the rippedoff attack scenes worth watching even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical build between the new actor and the actor in the original scene when the only scene evoking any response in a film is the oldest trick in the horror book the springloaded animal something is seriously wrong as it stands this is a despicable practice in two bgrade figures who need not worry about ruining their reputations because they havent got one ripping off their own material for the cheapest and quickest of dirty tricks simply because they can why else would anyone feel possessed to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the jurassic park series there isnt much more i can say other than that this film carries my very highest recommendations against viewing the only good thing about it besides gazing at melissa braselles navel is that now i dont have to see any of the carnosaur movies

1,what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i saw this at the atlanta georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very much a scifi aficionado and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning this is not a scifi nor action film of any sort let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari having watched a few episodeshis performance in that seemed stale and robotic but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen cellular i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story  which i think was even more his goalseeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend

0,ivan the terrible is more a filmed stage play than a bigscreenopus citizen kane  a similar work in many ways  is quite the opposite in the way we come to expect such fare in that it has lots of location shooting for exampleacting is meant to convey a characters motivations and thinking to the audience if it succeeds in making you understand the character what does it matter how it was done and considering the low amount of action how else is one to express events that influence the story and consequently the characters machinations and decisions other than exaggerated movementsas well theres a historical level why the acting style should not surprise the rise of totalitarian regimes in germany and ussr forced filmmakers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew how as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed cinemas evolution and techniques they only used what they knewthe nazis control of government in germany destroyed the great german film industry of the 1920s due to their total control over that film industry and propaganda films can only entertain german troops so much hence the need for popular german silent films of the 1920s for example so a lot of ivan the terrible films techniques would have been derived from such captured german films supplied to the film crew as mentioned in other commentsthere was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found overhyped it is by no means a bad cinematic experience  and definitely not amongst the worse films ever the acting is fine and part of the cinematography excellent even by todays standards more below definitely not a popcorn flick one cant leave their brain outside this ones door dated perhaps and very symbolic  only worth watching on the big screen if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these films chiefly bw experience it all depends upon what expectations one walks in withwarning  spoilers do not read the following comments in case they influence your personal view of the filmsand if one does not mind the obvious communist propaganda as opposed to capitalist propaganda for ivan is how stalin saw himself  obvious in his influence on the films direction see other comments  and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the us perspective will definitely understand this maybe ivan was an earlier incarnation of stalin or maybe not this is more a diatribe on stalin and his motivations decisions loneliness promotions of lackeys etc  using the persona of ivan  than any true historical record of ivan also note the obvious use of particular colours in the sequel red for the ussr in the banquet scene and perhaps blue for the usa during certain shots when the usurper wears the crownbut it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows or the exterior shot of the populace coming to beg ivans return to moscow

0,i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point the guy being awake during the surgery had nothing to do with the outcome it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didnt think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table give me a break jessica alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish im fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel you would be in more pain than that
0,demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is definitely an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i dont even consider it a movie i describe it more as a thing  a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and i first discovered this  thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friends house it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one well during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word its just a cheap poorly done ripoff of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed ive seen bad horror movies before manos troll 2 hobgoblins shudder i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid filmsfun fact this film is like a cockroach on steroids much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh
1,totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way what it is about estrangement i believe probably up to the viewer but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades dont know if im right but this movie really got to me see it i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him bothersome all the others do as they are told and pretend  to be happy this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006

0,i saw this film at its new yorks high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a lot to be desired jcmac was i felt the redeeming feature of this film true action and grit and out of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in lidl

0,given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing soif you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camerawork my 92 yearold grandmother wields a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plotnarrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah i cant believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one what how come she didnt tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didnt tell me she was going on a dateokay so the budget is low that doesnt mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget the iscore is interesting since all  with the exception of one  tracks have been written and performed by the writersdirectors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death metal band from swedenthe most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel
1,as one other imdb reviewer has remarked this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably better as it goes along yes it is released by roger corman and yes it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy however the juxtapositioning of the wifes career as a rising blues singer against the husbands gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical void or hole while shes away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done utilizing a very small number of locations and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming pool which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past again very freudian is also very unique in this genre and interesting i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amandas plight this aspect of the story elicits the cast is excellent i think

1,"hitchcock , displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving . two boxers fighting ; over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found : in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one , boxer gives the girl just before , she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm ! in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch ; has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview , shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives ? insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all : in ! all : the ring ? is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller"

0,wow i suspected this one to be bad but now i find myself just at a loss for words honestly no words of mine can do this movie any justiceill try to say something anywaythis truly is one unique gem one of the worst kindlash la rue  given his background as an actor  doing a whipfight with a toltec sorcererzombie during the movies climax a true stroke of genius without a doubtit rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone it happened numerous times with this onethe accents of the actors man the accents and the dialogues i heard them speak and the acting itself i just couldnt believe what i was hearingthat fat uncle farting so loudly when walking up to the house together with his little nephew for no apparent reason whatsoevertits yes theres titties and female ass theres even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beerthat one stretch his mouth over his facekill was the bomb a true highlightthe comedyaspects were just totally bonkers i just couldnt believe what i was seeing and hearing for a while i even thought that they were unintentional shaking my head in disbelief but about halfway in the movie i started to get the bigger picture guess it took me half a movie to dumbdown half of my brain to finally get iti had a really hard time believing this movie but its good really i think it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard opening it and then saying wooow look at all the storage space and she said it like she meant it i mean thats good dialogue and good acting rightoh and perhaps needless to say lash la rues whipskills suck major ass in the dark power its really sad and pathetic to behold thats all part of the comedy of course or wait i might be wrong no yes im wrong lash la rue was amazing with the whip it was the editors fault he messed it up cutting his lashes together and all or wait it might have been the camera operator he filmed from the wrong angles then why didnt phil smoot say anything thats it its the directors faultbut its a good movieim just gonna quit talking about it i have nothing meaningful to say anyway except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience some time soon

0,mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment and fair play to him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know what you are going to get with rourke  mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more  and you dont want most of itfirst and foremost  this whole thing just doesnt make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a busload of schoolchildren flees ireland for london he is on the run from the cops and from his own army comrades he has also vowed to never kill again it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for himhowever when he gets to london he is tracked down by a local mobster bates  looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burtons dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for 50000 and a boat trip to the us rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priests mouth shut he figures it is better than killing hima wealth of things arise here which just dont add up  1 why pick rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls  these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing2 not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes why didnt that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke 3hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off  without protection i may add  to take confession no way4 rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder  immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession why arent the cops checking the place out 5 rourke hangs around the church and hoskins blind niece in particular for days afterward without anybody bothering him what hes on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder stupid6 the cops actually meet rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing they dont even check up on him 7 why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat youd think youd want to get rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other 8 why does bates brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not restrain himself for a few days at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states ridiculous9 rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately  even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again  utterly ludicrous and besides  she falls in love with him in record time  a few days  10 the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates point of view11 things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say that in jest along bates houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house  but yet will bed a blind girl12 rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is  and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds it was embarrassing  the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked13 hoskins priest is an exarmy guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally uncalledfor and yet another cringeworthy sceneim gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning rourkes hair so falsely red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing styleoooppps  i have just mentioned themoverall  a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in rourke on the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director410
1,minor spoilersmisunderstood classic remains one of hensons finest and most personal films it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one misunderstood but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry juhls snappy screenplay and paul williamss knockout songs now while these things are admittedly great as is the movies formal playfulness screenplaywithinthescreenplay film break etc what distinguishes the muppet movie from the other muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture its a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business even before the muppets have made it piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performers life on the road in his haunting im going to go back there someday and worst of all kermit is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes one can only wonder what henson would have made of his familys management of the company after his death kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the final magic store number questions whether its all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesnt matter either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldnt work if it werent but the muppet movie isnt just another jokefest as the rest of the diminishingreturn muppet films would become no its a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and its every bit as effective today as it was 25 years ago 95 out of 10

1,whats fun about barkers nightbreed is that its the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burtons work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barkerespecially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankensteins monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the moviethis isnt a masterpiece and even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but its pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look

0,there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us version the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got the us version of this show is everything that reality tv shouldnt be instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt i do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive the rather vulgar product placement that takes place particularly by sears is also uncalled for rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community  perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses

1,although this was a film of only less than forty minutes it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever seen it accomplishes in less than 45 minutes what most films cannot in more than 90it is the story of two brothers one 18 and the other 10 they come from a poor farm family in mississippi both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of familyit brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behindi can fully recommend this film as beyond superb

1,welli wouldnt want to lecture anybody but i do feel the urge to say some things i consider important about this beautiful film i saw it for the first time in 1976 i was 14 and then one more time a year later that was it the rest of it was the pink lp of elton johns soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart how deep a week ago my cousin gave me a vhs copy as a present no dvds yet boywas i surprised poets have always sustained that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty love god idealist pursuits stay with you forever since they occur mostly at the hearts level no intellect yet they define your souls contours like a sculptor would do with a stone if sometimes we didnt tend to forget how right they are perhaps we would do better in understanding the meaning of every minute of every decision of every turning point of our lives so i confess i feel nostalgia but the fascinating part of this is watching the film again and through this trip back in time enriching that understanding of why we people from the 60s grew up as we did the spirit of those times is all here a genesis created far from the official world of consuming and economic success make love not war the beautiful pop ballads the poetry of the lyrics a totally romantic view of adolescent rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love these two lonely spirits still full of childhood innocence growing together as they learn mutual commitment and turning into adults i showed the film to a group of school youngsters and they abounded with such simplistic and cynical comments regarding it as nave and foolish guys be serious cinema is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotions but historical moments and this is exactly what friends does in a masterly way it reflects an idyllic idea of rebellion and new beginning we all dreamt about when we were 15 im now a musician and i feel some of us artists for that matter still dream about it how else could we live thats friends thats brother sun sister moon thats hair those were the times still alien to aids alien to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs with no melody to pornography presented as sexuality to this barbaric new world order growing after september 11th what a heart warming experience to see paul and michelle again timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world what a trip back to the very core of our hearts to paris to elton john at his best to that urban scenario surrounded by 2 cv citrons and the vw beetles what a fresh air from the peaceful cottage in camargue surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses they made us who we are as did serrat in spain brel in france peter paul and mary joan baez luther king the beatles the early bee gees belafontes spirituals gandhi the gospel of elvis people still hoping get this picture start with innocence and grow from there youll find out what its all about and from there youll have a solid and more truthful foundation some ideals to look for in life a way to handle personal and world affairs we need so much of this today give yourselves the chance and maybe someday the time of cynics will end i have an extra vhs copysantiago zuleta bogot colombia

1,many films attempt the ambitious few succeed this film is one of themthough billed as a black comedy that term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind max and grace multihyphenate michael parness has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotion quite a remarkable feat to be certainwhile the comedic aspects are certainly present the heart of the film lies in its leads david krumholtz and natasha lyonne the delicate balance of the film  really crazy versus real love  falls to them and they achieve it carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming ending david krumholtz in the titular lead role and as narrator anchors the picture and does an exceptional job we see the world through maxs eyes and krumholtz imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that one would not expect to be believable coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide there should be no doubt from this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles natasha lyonne might be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles the role of grace is expansive in scope requiring her to show both great rage and great tenderness  sometimes within seconds of each other she manages to convince us of graces deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and maniathis is not a laugh a minute type of comedy so dont see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish think more dramedy than comedy there are some very dark moments as one would expect given the subject matter of suicidal individuals and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by emma adele galvin as maxs sister sis the most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name actors in supporting roles while lorraine bracco and david paymer lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate the institution where max and grace meet are the real treat guillermo diaz is a wanton scene stealer as the delightfully frenetic oddball hector ralf moeller as bruno acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal rosanna arquette fully inhabits the role of vera with the crass vitriol of an embittered truck stop waitress even her hardhearted character melts eventually as does everyone who is touched by maxs literally undying love for gracecan love conquer all might be the question behind the film and even though the realist within says no movies are about an escape from reality even if only for a few brief hours i recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens spending a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psycheseattle international film festival  june 2005

1,saving grace is a feel good movie with its heart in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana shes living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors theres only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on its user its obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny its precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable

1,ive seen this movie twice both times on cinemax the first time in its unrated version which is softcore porn at its best and the second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way the unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we also get appearances by bqueen linnea quigley and burt ward robin from the old batman series

0,i dont think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film however i can offer a small recollection from seeing stv in the theater in the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in unison normally for a movie like this at least some diehard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer as the people filed out i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low murmursi remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it what an idiot the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart firstfavorite worst scene target shooting on a voyager space probe through a periscope no less space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought
1,the write wordwhat you see is what you get not really what madhur bhandarkars brave and brilliant page 3 does is destroy the myth attached to the glam and glitterati that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose livesread party habits we follow with such maniacal fervour which only our intrinsic voyeuristic streak can explain the page 3 phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic how exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate bhandarkar cleverly avoids that he is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence and in doing that he pieces together the various elements of this way of life like robert altmanalthough im not comparing bhandarkar to altmans genius bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive whether it is a page 3 wannabe nri the gatecrashers the newlyrich an upcoming model a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate charactersketch even if their parts may be miniscule and therein lays the films appeal konkona sen sharma plays madhavi sharma a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for nation today initially content with her job she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic profligacy but bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moralpolicing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone hence the movie is not only about madhavi but also equally about deepak suriboman irani madhavis editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery anjali thaparsoni razdan a socialite suffocating from the social pollution abhijeetrehan engineer a homosexual makeup artist and madhavis roommates pearlsandhya mridul the sassy airhostess and gayatritara sharmaan aspiring actress it seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many charactersand more in one story but full credit to nina arora and manoj tyagi for penning a tight screenplay the dialogues by sanjeev datta and bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail any narrative no matter how good can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances thankfully page 3 brims with actors and not stars konkona goes through her authorbacked role with effortless ease ditto boman sandhya mridul gets the best written part but almost overdoes it atul kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character at times the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possiblepaedophilia homosexuality etc but the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed ultimately bhandarkars attempt is to satiate our voyeurism but he takes it a step further he takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world these are the same people that indulged in newyears revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by natures ferocity clever writing skillfully incorporated songs able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values page 3 is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema abhishek bandekarrating  poor  average  good  very good  excellent29th january 2005

1,heres what i knew about atlantis before watching it  its officially disneys first animated scifi adventure im not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it described  the preview looked for the most part damn cool evidently it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the fact  it apparently did so badly that disney said screw it lets rerelease ispy kidsso with all that said how is the moviehellacoolim a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway but atlantis goes all out its a throwback to all the cgi eyecandy shots in beauty and the beast and aladdin so much so that its almost an effects animators bestof show the characters maybe arent that memorable except perhaps for the ships medical officer and the plots a little dull but this isnt a movie you watch for the plotheres a controversy that bothers me the failure as in it only took in like fivehundredmillion or something i know animators whod kill to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation i dont think thats true how do you account for the south park movie what about final fantasy really the story and the artistry is everything not the method i dont know what disneys comeback movie will be like but i dont think theyre out of the picture yet
0,although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of its intrigue i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these charactersthis won first place at cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogetherthis is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once its over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream  which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious  and i really wanted to like this film at every turn

1,this is quite a dull movie wellshot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and arthouse connotations all over it fails because the director takes no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates one of frances revered and regular working partner on films with depardieu  i believe they made 7 together  pialat fails to engage it seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and goodhearted husband around isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like i dont know i like his arms i like the way he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because i assume he loves her so he accepts and hope for what that she will one day wake up and come to her senses things like this are not answered in pialats condescending docudrama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that dont add up i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand jules et jim this is not the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving

0,i had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend who like me is a fan of the first this movie down right sucked it lacked the magic of the first you could actually understand every word the mice said the animation is crappy the palace is much much different from the first movie theres new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible luckily the prince didnt have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid basically its like the lion king 1 12 except its different stories all told by the mice the reason im giving this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable
1,ive loved all of creams work even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs spoonful and toad off of wheels of fire are prime examples still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today this power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate rock band reunions ever with their royal albert hall shows last year they may have gotten older as have their fans but the energy is still there with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own the renditions of white room badge politician spoonful sunshine of your love not one seems to miss a beat claptons solos have a formation that he sometimes doesnt have when on stage with his solo band ginger baker enough said jack bruce is sturdy enough with his vocals still with a kind of power that clapton could never get on his own bottom line if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year well some may have seen them its all on this dvd with cool special features

1,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive 2 and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa 2 although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically theres a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm

1,i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grownup i loved the effect used at the end and a little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of nancy drew just like the picture of betty crocker she keeps up with the times

0,i read about this film online and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received and viewing the trailer i decided to check it out for myself what a disappointment it starts out well enough the opening scene was actually pretty tense but from there its all downhill i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie but by doing so they took all the enjoyment out of watching it those choices combined with the csi editing use of music and montage lack of suspense scares or humor really drag this film down theres too much foreshadowing and to many subtle clues so when the first twist arrives early on you already know how the movie is going to end i gave the movie three stars because i think the cast did a good job other than that i cant recommend this movie

1,prot kevin spacey is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called kpax his psychiatrist dr mark powell jeff bridges tries to help him all the while trying to understand prot and find out if he is really from kpaxthis movie doesnt really fall into any particular genre one big part of kpax is drama sciencefiction another part fantasy plus add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what kpax is all about the story as you see above isnt too complicated or deep but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me no special effects or graphics accompany this movie and theres no need to have them the music in the film is great however a techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes kpax sound scifi and makes certain scenes intriguingkevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien prot from the planet kpax emotional with great facial expressions spacey does a fine job in the lead role jeff bridges is dr powell that aids and attempts to understand prot bridges is also excellent in his part bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should after all theyve both had a lot of experience the wife of dr powell is rachel powell played by mary mccormack mccormack plays her part well showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient alfe woodard plays dr powells coworker claudia villars we dont really see claudia too much but overall she puts in an alright performancekpax is rated pg13 for a sequence of violent images and brief language and sensuality and that covers it as far as violent images go we dont see too much a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them but thats all language is as follows 1 f word wow only one 11 s words and a few uses of the lords name in vain not too bad really the sensuality part is just from when prot explains to dr powell how reproduction works on kpax nothing terrible just something about it feels like having your nuts in a vice not too bad on the content level for a pg13 movie it could have been a lot worsein conclusion kpax is not a bad movie it wont stun you but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch it has some funny parts sad parts really sad parts and well you know what i mean its a story of a mental hospital patient what do you expect all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to kpax is a well done moviebonus if youve seen this movie already like it and are thinking about getting the dvd i would highly recommend it it has loads of extras to look through and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes 810

0,highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent spanish production aboutwell let me see just how close i can get to it the film opens with a woman having one of her cats killed by a young girl she then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this what relevance this plays out to is anybodys guess at the films end because the guy a swarthy photographer spies a beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment to witches mountain  for reasons again we are never privy to before they go patty must stop by the house and loud eerie chanting echoes in our heros ears again this is never explained the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn going on to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors are really quite goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman the leads are at least adequate and the climax  though it makes absolutely no sense at all  is wellchoreographedliterally with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair it just doesnt make any sense though and that is a huge detractor to me i could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing that is a major problem the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can get more out of it than me better power to you
1,whats fun about barkers nightbreed is that its the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burtons work it also has ; the goriness that one expects from a piece by barkerespecially fun is the performance by cronenberg ? as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankensteins monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the moviethis isnt ? a masterpiece and even barker has done more ; interesting and certainly more chilling work but its pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look

0,this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb nazis occult  government conspiracies i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awfulpart of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeaus character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid she just doesnt do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter siri barucanother big part is the pacing it starts off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focusedthe real problem is its simply not a pleasant movie to watch its slow dull none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery and sets some movies you see characters get tortured in this its the viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome

1,a pretty memorable movie of the animalskillingpeople variety specifically similar to willard in that it stars an aging character actor in this case a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne who puts in the only distinguished performance ive seen him give in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him yes this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable so that you will cheer when they die and really the selection of actors locations etc couldnt be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadencetremaynes character is snakey bender and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souzas music when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend gets married to a stripper thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert he goes on the rampage in the process creating a memorable pileup of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners one amusing game you can play while watching snakes is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliffall in all very cheap and exploitative but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies

1,first off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasnt meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in nonshock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoidpessimistici didnt trust anyone for about a week because i didnt want to wake up strung up and tortured
0,"wow just wow never before . have i ? seen a horror movie in which it seemed like : a bad self insert fanfic . that somebody wrote . one day in 20 : minutes and then : i happened to come ! upon lady frankenstein this movie takes ! everything you know about frankenstein . and turns it ? completely upside down and not in a . good way if . youve seen this movie you ? either stumbled across it ; on italian tv . or you have the dubbed ! version on the 50 , chilling classics box . set like i have ? as number 24 and ? lets just : say theres a reason why these movies are ! here because theyre not ; very good enough of that though onto the : movieit starts ; out with dr ? frankenstein trying to make the monster ; with ; his assistant : whosobviously not igor ; for some ! reason his college graduate daughter  shows up and states how she just : graduated with ? a medical degree cause ! yeah there were so many female doctors back then so she states how ! she wants to ! help her father with his work and he says no and then he makes the : monster ; and it kills him . so she grieves for ! exactly 7 seconds and then makes up a story ? with the assistant how it was , a burglar the ! monster escapes and goes on ! a rampage ok i ! really cant believe they , killed dr frankenstein so early ! in ! the movie he dies like20 minutes in : and then his daughter takes . over which doesnt make a whole lot of sense but sure ? so lady frankenstein decides the : best way to kill the monster whos now rampagingis to make : another ! monster oh yes . how i love her logic so her new monster she gets the body by , killing someone ! and putting the brain of the assistant in iti know just nod and . go along with ! it so the monsters meet ; and duke it out i ; love ! how the assistant asks why dont we just let the mobs ; kill it and ? she , answers with they wouldnt know how to kill it and in the end he kills it with an axe to the head haha oh ? yeah nobody else could have figured that one ! out ; so : in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein the endthis movie was justweird ; it was seriously like somebody wrote a self ! insert fanfic theres no other way to describe this . movie ; there ? were some odd . naked scenes too like this , girl was : having naked . sex in the park with her boyfriend . the , monster picks up the girl and the guy drives away haha ; nice guy she then struggles a bit and dies fromto be quite honest i really dont know what she died from but whatever its lady frankenstein it . doesnt have to make ; sense : this movie had a lot of . those : why moments to the point that : i : just gave , up movies . shouldnt do that , but for some reason i see that more than i probably ! should so final word its not the worst movie ive seen ! on ? this pack but its a tad boring and ; full of . many many : holes and random things so lady frankenstein gets 3 : frankenstein porn scenes out of 10"
0,the fbi story 1959 was warner bros 149 minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences  in flashback  to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture  stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles  who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife  he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is max steiners remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in 1959 which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young love theme  which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with 43 people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so  after that you can send it to hell wow
1,i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession i just wanted to check it out i was not expecting much of anything after all a musician an actor and a screenplay writer not possible for so much talent to reside in one person right wrong obsession aside it quickly became one of my favorites the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the endat times the acting seems a little over the top i do however believe its done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character otherwise i wouldnt have expected the level of acting witnessedits worth seeing more than once i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two aroundi completely recommend this movie feel free to go in with your doubts but im sure it will find a place on your shelf

1,cinemas greatest period started in postwar europe with italys neorealist movement during the next 2 or 3 decades that followed frances new wavers caught everyones attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in 1971 luchino visconti brought the artform to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work death in venice which might as well be called the death of europoean cinema after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats coppola scorsese  co this movie absolutely feels like a grand summingup not just of viscontis particular obsessions but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the visconti revealed here hes not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmoswe will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the centurys great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background gustav mahlers 5th symphony taking full advantage of mahlers ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies its a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance  a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpsecinema just doesnt get better than this ill ignore the complaints from the ritalinaddicts out there who say that its too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbachs flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movies thematic concerns ie which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what its mostly about is suffering romantic capital r suffering in particular as a suffering romantic himself visconti knew whereof he spokespoiler    i guess if for nothing else see death in venice for its portentous opening credits    and for its unforgettable ending with bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the object of bogardes dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty death in venice is a miraculous work of art dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie its ostensibly in english but the dvds sound seems muddy and theres a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway
1,i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score 7 out of 10
1,the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors it isnt their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry eitherto me it is the misenscene of the entire movie the settings the lighting the props all add to the mood for love between the main characters a whiff of smoke from chows cigarette tells us his state of mind the everchanging tightfitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects the constraints of decisionmaking the ruins of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leadsthe excellent use of misenscene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters relationship the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more

0,the trouble with this film like so many other films that fail is the scriptthe script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place what is the story here ok its a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into 100 or so minutes some selection and editing is required but this script just didnt select or edit enough it didnt render hoffmans life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through them get the bigger picture of the whole manthe movie wanders from being a straight plodding troubled genius biopic to semidocumocumentary using new shots faked up to match archive footage to sub true life sob stories movie of the week the whole im bringing up a son who doesnt know im his dad shtick to political conspiracy theory movie etc etc it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be and the halfhearted citizen kane like narrative structure reporter interviewing people from hoffmans past is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts outthe movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important the whole scene in the psychiatrists office after vincent donofrio pounds the window screaming im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im acting im acting im acting could have easily been cut all that happens is the psychiatrist says you have bipolar disorder heres some lithium and the two women in his life say we could see you weekends more often and bang thats it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god pointless tells us nothing about anything yet when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesnt make any sense to the audience suddenly hes dealing in heroin where did this come from why what is going on here i being a middleaged leftie would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of the man the pigs the fuzz etc as brutal besuited unthinking hippiehating androids it may have been like that in 60s america i dont know i wasnt there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemichaving said all that vincent donofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything even reading a bus timetable though she just wasnt right for this part

1,i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandys bodacious bod if you dont expect anything else such as clever plot twists and believable character development you wont be disappointed consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who threaten to come between her and her mommy suzanna arquette who obviously doesnt want to play the sex kitten  she leaves that up to her daughtermandys face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete 5alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a perfect 7to10 ratio of waist to hips and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratioand no flat butt to boot which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the nether hemispheres mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candlelit hot tub with her blindfolded germanguy victim no 2 but from all i could see from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didnt need a double to prove itmandys acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic mommys girl with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no 2 who also happened to be her mothers lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise onedimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men  the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reasonmandys ubernordic facial features coupled with her ubervoluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress id advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages especially italian and spanish  and maybe french although i dont know if they would go for her type but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body  but maybe her face is just a little too nordic and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980s whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the groundvambo drule

1,i have seen several yul brynner filmsyet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls smiles and laughs brynner might have been equally arresting in ten commandments taras bulba the magnificent seven the brother karamazov and the mad woman of chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one he is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shotequally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is deborah kerr the script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestiveshe reprised this sort of role years later in the night of iguana the film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the russians in fact she is shown as running away from the russian major in contrast to the maupassant story or the isak denisen story yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the kerr characterkerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress she puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays which often clashes with the spirit of the character it is this contradiction that makes her roles in the journey quo vadis and the night of iguana memorablewhy is this an unusual film it is not easy in hollywood to see russian characters portrayed as good peopledr zhivago was an exception brynners romance of a horse thief was again great cinema by abraham polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the postmccarthy erathe film is also unusual in its castinggreat french actors gerard oury and anouk aimeerub shoulders with jason robards jr and british actor robert morley in many ways the film is international than american all four are great actors and add to the entertainmentthose who have read maupassant and denisens works will find the film is not true to either work yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized censored version has a dignified charm of its ownprovided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group i think litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film while entwining bits of both written tales eg the last bus ride and the final kissbut i do have one grousewhy do hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories only recently eg insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits
1,this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy but profane woman who is in trouble but finds . a way to survive and be the hero sound familiar there are plenty of holes in this story things just dont add up and some of the suspense is a little corny but  ? that suspense is very good there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it the story starts off slow but : kicks in pretty soon and stays that way making it an involving movie for the viewer thats why i give it a pretty good rating  the movie gets you involved in it ? bullock is more cute than annoying which she normally is to me so this is my highestrated movie with her in it
0,ill just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that its essentially prespoiledthis movie derives a few ideas from a southern classic to kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got its ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this youll say oh yeah that is a ripoffi think the truly entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once youve identified a plot element is to figure out whether theyll stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this one

1,the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and ive seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are what really made it for me cristina rainess father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine its your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think its one of the better ones out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfiedperformances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part shes beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldnt help but love him martin balsamjos ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli wallachchristopher wlaken do well as the bumbling detectives beverly dangelo has one chilling scene that i wont spoilbottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look710

1,for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience okay you dont need to read any further nowi already guess most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture so i should say ponyo is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child discovering the world as you wanted to see it making up your own rules and boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time ponyo swerves away from many of the problems that allage films tackle it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problemsthe two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen they are not simple minded arrogant or naive just curious enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with many films regard children from the outside as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter ponyo brings everyone back to that world in ponyo there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most which the film values with high esteem it is worth it to remember to feel it again

1,"i wasnt expecting a great deal from this film so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy its noteworthiness is mainly due , to the talent and appeal : of . its star john garfieldgarfield plays jack a boxing star who is ! framed for murder he must go on the run and ends up out in the sticks . with gloria : dickson and : the dead : end kids here is offered a , chance for redemption yet will the past catch up with him yet garfield was ; an actor ahead of his peers before the term method was ; even coined and before brando ever screamed istella he brings natural to the screen his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production also interesting is that . his role here as a boxer has shades of . that golden : boy role he so . desperately wanted to covet ! on . screen garfield looks : the type and goes the distance as a boxer proving his acting worthann sheridan is here ; in a small role at the beginning as jacks : trampy girl goldie i havent ; ever , thought much of sheridan , but i liked her . here she plays well off garfield dicksons performance is a little tired and she does ? not share good chemistry with ; garfield the dead . end kids are here and garfield ? seems their natural idol ; even more so than cagney claude rains is miscast and he looks uncomfortable in the . role in many a scene strange as he always was such a reliable actoralso ; interesting to : note is the . director busby berkeley : best known ? for his early musicals ; with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images . directs a different genre here with remarkable ease he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirablya very good film that deserves greater , attention 810"
0,i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom we my gfriend and i walked out about an hour into it what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargonsub atomic particles are thoughts by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals a drop of 25 in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated wow what a rigorous scientific study im sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate hogwash hooey bull pucky btw it was funded by the ramtha cult the leader of which was one of the experts which were interview by the filmmakers no ulterior motives here right
1,the team of merian cooper and ernest schoedsack produced a documentary of 50000 bakhtiari people and their animals on the summer migration to winter grazing the basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a forgotten people and how they lived during what we in the west knew as the roaring twenties a more drastic contrast could not be imagined raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die to make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end the version that i saw had fascinating iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film having said all this the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evenings entertainment the crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple retakes the western intertitles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day offduty entertainment by desert police becomes a policemans ball the producers went on to make the docudrama chang 1927 and the totally commercial king kong 1933 the migration theme is used again in people of the wind 1976 and in himalaya 1999 recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into  and then highly recommended for them

1,the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required this is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies the plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process its car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy played by edward norton for norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as the score mark wahlberg and charlize theron deserve better scripts warning if youve seen the trailer then you have seen the movie if youre looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job

0,the biggest problem with in search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to it at all shicksunn produced these documentary films in the 1970s and just into the 80s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in onsadly historic jesus is really little more than a thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more superior in search of noahs ark which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is given much screen timefor fans of these quasidocumentary films like jupiter menace and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesnt offer much

1,"! the national gallery of art showed the , longthought lost original uncut version of this film on july 10 2005 it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release : the character of the cobbler a moral goodygoody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top also the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs , versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form a wonderful film of seduction and power hopefully there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to , appreciate its great qualities look for it"
1,this is a film about loneliness and how the distance  physical and emotional  between people tends to stultify relationshipsthe narrative is simple to the point of banality a young man yusuf emin toprak from a rural village arrives in istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin mahmut muzaffer ozdemir yusuf wants work in the big city after trying for a few weeks to find work without any success the strain of having yusuf living with him is too much for mahmut they quarrel  nothing physical just verbal eventually yusuf goes leaving mahmut alone again end of storyexcept for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film much is said visually dialog is used to bring out disagreement distrust hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two menthere are many visual gems in this film for example while searching for work young yusuf needing a relationship tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city the look on his face as he is thwarted every time says it allor wanting a cigarette yusuf opens the door to the balcony of mahmuts apartment and lights up in the frigid december air leaving the door open mahmut eventually gets up from his work desk walks to the door all glass and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time then mahmut closes the door leaving yusuf out in the cold the metaphor is completeor mahmut cleaning up after yusuf grudgingly and with increasing anger and all the while yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work and spends mahmuts money on a toy for a nephew yusuf is emotional untidy impulsive and vulnerable mahmut is rational logical selfconfident and a demanding control freak the rightbrain leftbrain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look a gesture a frown than any words can conveybut mahmut is not completely emotionless he still loves his exwife who tells him that shes off to canada with her husbandtobe mahmut affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex and makes sure that she is okay about going he wishes her well he says goodbye he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking later when she calls to say a last goodbye on the way to the airport mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves the poignancy of the emotion on his face as she disappears through a door is worth the waitall in all this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director nuri ceylan some might argue that the pace is too slow but life goes slowly for much of the time especially for those who are alone the camera work is relatively simple also choose the scene set up the camera and lighting and let the actors move across the scene enter the scene and leave the scene all the while keeping the camera still there were a few panning shots some highangle tracking shots a few rural scenes  but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens except for tv and radio music within the story there is no music sound track and there are those many long silences as the two men sit and watch tv together andor engage in very limited conversationi saw this movie on tv so i was amused to see that on a few occasions i was watching tv as they were watching tv also the silence in the movie matched the silence in my house i was awake all others in bed my chair and position matched that of mahmuts as he watched tv quite eerie giving me a sense of almost being there with him and i guess i was in a senseill say no more because i want you to savor the other scenes that i havent described its not a movie for everybody for sure more than any movie ive seen it shows just how much we die when we are all alone  just as we are all alone when we die mahmuts face as it fades to black in the final scene will stay with me for a long long timehighly recommended for serious movie buffs

1,it was a fun film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and the humour do work i must admit that you dont have to see it in a theater it will do very well on a small tvset tip see it with some close friends

0,no im not kidding if they ever propose a movie idea they should be kicked out of the studio im serious their movies are exactly the same in every one and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they easily resolve hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends think about it if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these movies are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters im sure that when they were really young and made some ok movies some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years or something so that now that theyre what 17 they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studios money let me advise you stay away from marykate and ashley its for your own good
0,not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the 80s but not for the 21st century

1,this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat fraidy cats previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different ! eras in time and are constantly ; trying to kill him off but he is most . fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the ? shape of a number 9 and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy i watched this movie almost every day as ! a child o

1,one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema or indeed most anything done outside these holierthanthou united states are the permutations that crop up in postworld war two japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion the same thing happens in genre filmmaking as well though again im referring to movies made outside the u where were just too sophisticated in our closemindedness to appreciate anything that isnt about or by us would an american company for instance back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler el santo or a werewolf paul naschy or a reallife martial artist bruce lee as for television forget it while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine ive always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was how to put it kindly a bit lacking to this very day there hasnt been a payperview channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia there are lots of softcore porn masquerading as entertainment shows but the socalled action channel for instance has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc there was of all things at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery the 5 deadly venoms in its own right as fascinating as any other genrebased whodunit western cop show etc this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work its now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve if youre a martial arts movie fan rejoice one of the greatest movie genres of all time specifically the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s are getting a longoverdue second life and greatly appreciated second look on dvd

1,show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen though shes a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billymany stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup im sure when people saw the film in 1928 they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays its not the case even for film buffs in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree rod laroque aileen pringle and many othersdavies was adorable and a lively comedienne its a shame william haines quit the movies  he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the dayshow people is a simple story told in a witty way its also a look back at an exciting era in hollywoods history and contains performances by two wonderful stars

1,this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who arent really conformist movie pickers dont get me wrong  there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it  you know youre either a tween or dont really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor  despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find a good movie thats not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos a great film not to be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a must buy

1,unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor a wannabe tough redneck played to perfection by brad renfro although the story may seem slightly farfetched the two boys attempt to riverraft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aids the emotion actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life being a big brother to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship illness prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity
1,kubrick proved his brilliantness again now in a suspensehorror film based on stephen kings book titled the same way jack torrance is a man in his forties married with one child and with a past of trouble and alcoholism the overlook hotel in colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather and there is a wellpaid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months and torrance who was looking to become a writer found it perfect but the manager advised torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter potentially dangerous and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family even before they got there his son danny who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future shinning knew the place wasnt good and didnt want to go once they installed themselves in the hotel things started right but within a month jack began acting strange irritated and depressed at this point we know something is going to happen but dont know when and how scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to danny and someone who attacked him violently they are not alone in this place later on jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them like if they were his family among them the famous psychotic caretaker delbert grady grady tells torrance that he must kill his family because they are intruders in the hotel obeying this order jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things ive ever seen happen here the ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute

0,the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike  but are not in any way expect for being smart  one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the titlei honestly didnt like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i dont get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however its visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noisesthe movies storyline is very simple most of whats going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cutsi will say openly that this movie didnt meet my expetations a tiny bit
1,the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itits hard to place this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbut just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullyit features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch710

0,what this film has is its realism  you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his homework on the subject of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style  however the problem is unless youre a big fan of the sport theres not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention before anyone asks why i watched it  i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but thats not really a good enough reason for watching
1,shtrafbat  penal battalion is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during world war two one can almost call it the russian equivalent of highly acclaimed band of brothers miniseriesformed in july of 1942 on the eve of battle of stalingrad the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties sometimes as high as 90 prisoners of gulag political prisonconcentration camps deserters soldiers who were captured by germans but managed to escape soldiers accused of breaching protocol were all given a chance to join the shtrafbat and prove that there were not traitors of the motherland with their lives those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the lawthis miniseries features a look at one such shtrafbat under the command of tverdokhlebov  an honorable officer who was captured by the germans was shot and left for dead it features a colorful and varied group of people thrust into a situation from which there is no escape the authoritative yet honorable crime boss antip kulak the fist and his little gang of unreformed criminals a young jewish intellectual who struck his antisemite officer father orthodox priest mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed in the housetohouse fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the gulag but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living and to keep on fightingalthough set during a war not every episode features combat in fact what combat scenes there are are often chaotic sporadic and short  which was probably the intent of the director in between the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and tragedies the rape of a young woman by one of shtrafbats soldier and then his execution execution for supposed awol periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a german bunker stocked with food and champagne the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors cheating on a spouse and other situations feature prominently the camera is unflinching  it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature nor from raw human emotions the dialog likewise does not censor out the swearingthe acting is superb and deep and the script is likewise well written everything from rage to weariness to resignation to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to is rendered almost faultlessly one complaint might be that some of russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture because it is a history drama in a sense some of the terms and situations military rank mention of other battles certain historical references may be lost on some viewers this understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy shtrafbat but these references are a nice touch of authenticity another complain that could be levied is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps
1,its one of the best movies that i have seen this year  i dont agree with the person who said its boring of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all but personally i spent a very good moment this movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes there is also a nice touch of humor for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father and then her husband says how can someone abuse someone like you and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games d very funny  i recommend this movie to everyone and by the way sorry for my poor english im from france
1,its a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so its a good match if you want to the guy or the girls

0,i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in 1982 i remember dialogue from tatum oneal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burtons character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didnt translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awfulthis movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality recall the blue lagoon and other brooke shields annoyances lipstick little darlings beau pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults as a teenager during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the 70s and 80s made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speakcircle of two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like blue lagoon in fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you will never see if you didnt see it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again

0,this movie was probably one of the worst movies ive seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply regret ehh where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies blatant dialog such as how ya doingnot that great doc directly after an attempted exorcism of a mans daughter and then his wifes attempted suicide of course hes not that great was at some points kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattooed  peirced girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah and they never actually got the deed donethe acting horrible x100 i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel del zamora and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty music a gun and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody elses acting was horrible as wellthe lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters couldnt be counted on one hand like 50 thumbs downps what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways

1,the national gallery of art showed the longthought lost original uncut version of this film on july 10 2005 it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release the character of the cobbler a moral goodygoody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top also the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form a wonderful film of seduction and power hopefully there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities look for it
0,this movie is about tyrannus a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead tyrannus we learn after about an hour is also called demonicus this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity psychology and ourselves the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little todo list killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin by possessing the body of a college guy he uses a magic mindcontrol helmet to do this which the college boy willingly puts on his head and then at several points in the movie takes off and puts back onmaria performs oral sex on a poor mans sean willian scott and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this utter misfortunethis movie is empty and will hurt you see it
1,the opening of imamuras masterpiece avoids mere sensationalism in its depiction of the unfathomably horrifying events of august 6th 1945 in which 90 of hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were annihilated in an instant instead imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the catastrophe focusing on such portentous images as the diabolic mushroom cloud louring silently in the distance and the black rain that spatters a beautiful young womans face the rest of the film traces the ramifications of the latter incident bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath over 100000 people died of radiation poisoning down to the intelligible level of the plight of yasuko yoshiko tanaka and her small community bound by the bombthe survivors strive for normalcy and continuity most notably by attempting to find a suitable marriage for yasuko but the imminent possibility of radiation sickness shadows every aspect of their lives yasukos potential suitors naturally enough shy away from a young woman no matter how attractive who might suddenly grow sick and die genuine love when it finally does appear does so unexpectedly and ambiguously we are left wondering if love across class lines is more a token of yasukos status as damaged goods or of a common humanity thrown into bold relief by harsh circumstances that transcends class divisionsthe films classically restrained style intensifies the impact the spare eloquent interior shots reminding us that imamura began his career as an assistant to the great ozu imamuras mastery is evident for example in the paired scenes of yasuko bathing the first emphasizing her lovely back and legs the second how her hair is falling out the shots stand almost as bookends to the narratives trajectory distilling its tragic essence the films documentarystyle realism is violated for expressive purposes several times perhaps most notably in a scene that lays bare the troubled interior life of a shellshocked veteran both the score by the renowned avantgarde composer toru takemitsu and the stunning black and white photography contribute greatly to the films brooding atmosphere when in the final shot yasukos uncle kazuo kitamura the films laconic narrator looks to the vacant sky for a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration the black and white imagery suddenly becomes so poignant that it is almost unbearable few films from japan or anywhere else for that matter could be compared to the great humanist japanese masterpieces of the 1950s this film is one of them when i finished viewing it for the first time i sat stunned unable to move for at least five minutes overwhelmed as i was by the emotions great tragedy should inspire terror and pity

0,i dont know what the oscar voters saw in this movie but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar all i know is that fortunately there was gene kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as i believe it is first of all i dont think leslie caron was really fit to play such a role she isnt that talented she isnt a great dancer and shes not good looking at all its a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if leslie caron hadnt been in this it might have made a terrific movie the story was intelligent the directing wasnt bad and as i said gene kelly was pretty good now im not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her im just saying it because i think thats what the worse part of the movie is shes probably a good actress but i cant tell because i havent seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in an american in paris so if you want to see it go ahead but im telling you youre way better off watching singin in the rain

1,a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movies main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more im not very sure whether or not thats flattering portrayalthis is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love storiesin general im a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but theres something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy

1,in 2004 i wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie  to me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule i think in many ways the best years of our lives is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the mid1940s after wwii i believe coming home and the deer hunter both released in 1978 were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in the best years of our liveswhat really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when i was in college around 198081 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the moviethis movie still packs a wallop and im very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time im very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on imdb and afi also though it was in competition with what eventually became a christmas classic its a wonderful life arguably the best years of our lives oscar wins including best picture were very welldeserved ive just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years the best years of our lives is still a powerful beautifully acted and wellcrafted motion picture

0,i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this but they tried to do too muchwhy they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me i dont want to knock burt or adam for the way they look nowits been 35 years since they appeared at batman and robin but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting badguys was kinda sad i would rather of just seen the exstars do commentary the batmobile side story was stupidas for the flashback movie i think it was too short and left out way too much it was really just a quick overview in my opinion id like more background they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an exsmoker that was it on those 2id love to read the book i am sure it has more in it that this showed like why was there 2 riddlers or why 3 catwomans or 3 mister freezes where was commishioner gordon cheif ohara alfred mister freeze king tut etc the list goes on like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in itvery disappointing and really corny

1,what is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late 1950s known as the french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important

0,i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didnt its one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone sepiatoned imagery pretentious title no sex and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfxcgi so that we the stupid audience get it one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong instead they call the nobelprice named after an actual person called alfred nobel the nobleprice jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron
1,watchers is a fun movie if its not taken too seriously the novel written by dean r koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in its own way the film has a lot of changes for the novel watchers the one difference is the main character travis in the book he was an adult and an retired delta force soldier while in the film hes a teenager watchers has its good points the film does have some gory scenes in parts im a fan of micheal ironside and it was cool to see him in this film he always does a great performance in all his films the oxcom costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film the dog einstien was impressive since it was well trainedthe film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab a dog and a monster both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them the dog finds a teenager named travis who takes him home and discovers that hes intelligent and so he names the dog einstein meanwhile the oxcom is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand soon travis learns that his not safe as the oxcom is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in its way so travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend whos being held at the hospital by the two agents they then hideout in the woods while the government agents and the oxcom are not far behindwatchers is not a great adaptation of dean r koontz novel but it is a entraining 80s horror flick some fans of the book may not want to watch this since its not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80s horror movies may want to check this out

0,what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline within 3 episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming  where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itazjazz

0,the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant them it in the hope that given a little time theyll convince you its possible alas with tv movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience not here though the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately its not enough to save the day oh and the less said about the ending the better happy filmviewing everyone

1,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for mefor example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost 2

1,i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville kentucky when i was a boy the scene where dr carmus finds the gardeners coffin and the breathing dead body therein was the scariest part of the movie for me only intensified by the darkness of the film i also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers

1,i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christies darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but its my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliantplease let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewans version is watch and enjoy
