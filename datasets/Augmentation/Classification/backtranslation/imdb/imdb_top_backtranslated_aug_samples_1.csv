0,the film seemed to appeal to me because of the new type of pokemon celebi but the plot was outside of course and didn't have as much interest as the other films it was a loss of money and time the same horny humor and click bad guy the film was of no use to do if you wanted to make famous pokemon the film should better not associate with animes such as dragonballz digiton or yugioh the drawing and the settings are of no level to the standards of the original anime it is a shame also to talk about this movie I bet fans of pokemon will be disappointed with the result of the film and giving up on pokemon digiton is more anime and does not fall anywhere near pokemonits second movie comes out late 2002

0,oh boy this movie is so mediocre I don't really know what to write exactly about it I think it's easier to write what it's not very entertaining its original step and there's not a character in the whole movie I was worried about the kind of reality that I remember a certain reality show on mtv but without any interesting person it just hangs on and on and I could barely wait for it to end the only thing that stopped me from turning it off was jennifer lyons here thought a long time on this film to find a good thing to say about it what I liked was the reminder not to judge a person by the first impression you get like Holly did when she accused nicole who won a score of 2 out of 10 instead of a 1

0,the different nudity scenes that the other critics mentioned are wrongly made and a double body was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to make the scenes itself maybe she should have refused the role offer other than the film was no worse than other typical Canadian films like other critics pointed out Canadian films are usually poorly written and lack entertainment value what is what most film viewers hope to get perhaps Canadian film producers are consciously trying to de-immerciate their films but they forgot a very important thing by definition films are a commercial thing

0,An absolutely funny film that I live in London and the plot is so badly sought out that no one could be terrorized on the underground London in a short time it is not in service every night there are teams of maintenance agents there check the tracks and perform repairs etc. that there are homeless people who live there is just as unlikely or that it is even possible to get locked up and have no access to a mobile phone in that day and age the worst thing likely to happen if someone was there after the last train is that they could get graffiti sprayed on them although it was under control because of the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of history remembering in London overall we have more security cameras than any other city in the world if it had been put in a city I'm not familiar with maybe I could have appreciated it by the idea that his film might have made me feel like I had no idea that it would have caused me a high quality so I would have thought it would have caused me a great deal of hope that it would have caused me not to be able to suspend it.

0,There are some things that I can never understand like this movie what if I had to create a really cheap and boring watch dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste this into an amateur video clip having people screaming and getting eaten by the same thing how can you even believe that a completely fake dinocroc cgi that seems completely out of place would influence the events in this movie I know that its low budget degrades and all producers could do better than make a piece of shit that nobody will ever see or sit through it just makes sense are the really stupid people that they would sit through this apparently to laugh this thing is not even worth anything laughing

0,I understood before watching this film that it would be a gore film with a low budget but even by these low standards this film did not cut it the problem is so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad writing featuring sound music and editing I expected all this to be bad and that's the biggest problem with this film is that it didn't even do a good job on the belly and gore most of the action takes place offscreen and all that we can see are the following effects that seem very wrong even by the low budget standards gore films there really is no excuse for the gore being so badly done Peter Jackson made the bad taste so low budget at about the same time and it has in some way been able to make hoses and gore much more convincing than shown in this film a failure about each level I can recommend this film to someone to distance from this

0,"I was looking forward to this film being an old fan of robert e award mainly from a conan point of view. I didn't expect much and I thought they couldn't spoil it too expensive how false it was that it was the main defect was it was rather dull it needed zip with a nice help of supernatural sword fights goeson and as you got a little gore but all the rest was just lifeless enough the section of the middle seemed just to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow folded horse carts and even the dialogue and development of the character on the costumes and side effects more well but not enough to keep your interest thinking that it would have been better to tone the tempo and go for a grade of 12a like a ten-year-old boy I may have liked this film probably about age I was first reading the pretty funny conan stories maybe that says a lot about my anticipation of the film going really arthouse with tone direction, etc."

0,"I can't believe that the author of this movie did everything to make me finish the cover of the video box shows a showman with shark teeth and scary eyes that I look like a scary bad but as the old saying never judges a book by his cover the whole bad guy looked like a box cut a part of the movie that a girl gets killed by terribly salad claws the set was pretty bad as they could put all the stuff in the lapland but not a tropical island instead of taking this movie as a sip that I think they wanted to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the teasing effects that you can argue that I didn't look at the first but since what I would be safe if I didn't try the biggest joke in this movie that I thought the snowballs had been made in a bad way, and that the carrots were a complete embarrassment if I had to see them pass through the first, but I would be safe if I wanted to try the biggest game in this movie that I had to escape the last line of the movie that the last minute had to make the movie escape."
0,"talk about rubbish i cant think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects i cant believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finishthe front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by its cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in lapland but no a tropical island insteadi took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i havent watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldnt attempted itthe biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a islandlastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way throughin conclusion i give this film 0 stars out of 5

0,"oh my oh it's really a bad movie the actor is absolutely atrocious the script is god and the photography is just terrible what makes this movie stand out however is that you never care about a single good soul guy or bad guy living dying or dead in all 87 minutes oh she died huh thought they would be the best reaction that I could gather after each character of murder are so black orwhite that with the turned off volume you could still figure out who, while cast voices had a strange monotonous quality in their faces give the impression that you're watching an old silent film with a lot of exaggerated wegling frowns eyebrows and pensive looks each character is a onetrick pony without humor without passion once they have fulfilled their particular role in that fiasco demanded their creation they are summarily rejected vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen transmitter of skyggen title American pony once they have accomplished their particular role in that fiasco they might not have been vaguely rejected so part of this movie could have been rejected as a movie vaguely rejected"

0,the complaints are valid for me the biggest problem is that this soap-opera is too destined for women I agree with these night soaps like gray anatomy or bad bet or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the seeing that they will never end however when the parallel idea day soaps just aimed at putting hunky men taye diggstim Daly and chris lowell in sexual tension and trombs and many ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called small hospital it seems that the general hospital or a homologous woman at Baywatch that was what the men wanted and they had if that's what the women want so either it but the idea that it's a great eyebrow show or something men looking is unrealistic

0,This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but finally this effort is too vain and too strongly concentrated on the tracks there is no doubt that Mary Tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much light away from the rest of the castanother problem is the overloading of the script with clichés the girl who secretly withdraws from the university an older woman finds it difficult to get a good job and ends up with a fairly humiliating work the executive network with her executive toys that goes for the substance the journalist who stands for his beliefs etc. there is nothing really wrong with one of these that is to say they are all firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much dejavu and too few surprises

0,I was sadly disappointed by this film because it seemed false to me and that the characters were not strong enough to carry the films rather weak attempt of horror the basic idea of the film was interesting but unfortunately it was not able to really arouse or shock there was a part in the whole film that I thought was horrible but even who didn't buy it I managed to love the kate character at the end of the film as it seemed to soften and become a little more realistic at the end the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not really necessary for this film and I think the director got carried away with the myriad of characters used without purpose if he had left it to the basic characters what made him more of a solo effort on Kates part he may have worked Jeremys acting was the least wooden to say and I felt uncomfortable watching the wrong on screen chemistry or lacks such disappointing shame

0,"I think this is the last time she wrote a movie, I think I'm wondering what the man who played the character who was the drummer deserved a 3 because I think there was a little talent in the movie johanna watts or did watson do a pretty good job that she was crying and distracting in a game and I think she was able to transmit that emotion although the man who played the character who was the drummer deserved a 3 because I think there was a little talent in the movie johanna watts or did watson do a pretty good job that she was crying and distracted in a part of a movie and I think she could have happened that day I think the man who played the character who was the drummer did well for his small number of actors did a good job that the main actor david forgot his last terrible name with names that I think we could do for a while that we could see that we did for a while"
0,"im only going to write more because its required however the summary i put at the top is way too wordy for what this film was you pretty much know whos in on it from the beginning in spite of its attempts at plot twists and turns acting talent trying hard to have looks of shock and dismay when a twist happens you never really need to wonder whodunit in this mysterythe more i write the more i feel bad that i have to write so much in order to have a comment but rules are rules i really feel bad about saying this but this is the lowest ive ever rated a movie i think it makes me wonder what im saving votes of 1 and 2 for however i thought this film deserved a 3 since i believe there was some talent in the film johanna watts or is it watson did a pretty good job she was crying and distraught in one part and i thought she conveyed that emotion well the man who played the character that was the drummer did well too for his short partmany of the actors did an ok job but the lead actor david forget his last name terrible with names was pretty bad i think he must have thought he was doing dramatic displays for the young and the restless or days of our lives if you try you can just picture him in a white lab coat playing a doctor with multiple personalities on general hospital it doesnt help that the movie is even shot like a daytime soap although im pretty sure i could shoot this same movie with a camcorder though without the obvious and soapish sound editingfirst time i ever thought the money to rent this movie was wasted though i wouldnt watch it again unless i was paid a large sum of money

0,"another sadistic and ultrasleazy late 70searly 80s revenge movie wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a ripoff of other ripoffs like i spit on your grave and especially night train murders storywise this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleazefactor by a thousand this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three this is a very tame movie and there wasnt even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women but the sex in terror express isnt unsettling at all on the contrary these rapists spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves the music is great the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever beheld the villains are wimps and the trainpassengers are so motionless they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled terror express should be in the pornsection of videostores

0,the first episode set the bar high enough I thought that he starred William wounded as a killer who is contracted to kill a toy we gave very little information about his character or who is paid to kill in fact the episode is remarkable to have no dialogue at all back to his modernist penthouse it is delivered a package containing toy soldiers which gives him a smile but it rejects and goes to his business but it is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to make war lead jeeps shoot machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters the special effects are good for a TV show and it becomes quite tense as he does around the apartment by using his mind to survive sometimes get the upper hand and other times I did not spoil the end but enough to say that it was a little smart twist that gave me hope for the rest of the series but I was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all stupid and I lost interest by the fourth a beautiful king adaptations are still not a mixed exception and I was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all stupid and I lost interest by the fourth one a beautiful king adaptations always a little bit.

0,not the best of the movies to watch today I read a lot of reviews on shine and expected it to be very good but this film disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here there was not a single moment of fear I expected a thriller horror movie but there was no horror thriller the only scene where I was afraid was during the chapter change scene showing Wednesday there are many fragments i the film most things are left unexplained with nothing to bind it to whatever it is history does not tell us about women or other scenes that is shown could be a good movie to watch in the 80s but not for the 21st century

0,"oh the hilarity oh the joy another film that is so bad its good or so i thought in actual fact this one misses the so bad its good phase and goes sadly straight to the could have been so bad its good but they screwed it up and made it plain badfor a start its way too long cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable then put in such ludicrous plots as the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the earth because he has all the food stockpiled and hell be rich if the mission fails duh or the talking bomb plot device last seen in dark star guess whatjust like in dark star the bomb has a malfunctionhmmmm add in a dash of we cant act our way out of a kindergarten play and you have solar crisis in a nutshelllight relief is to be had in the form of jack palance or jack pants as we called him in this flick whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kids dad to come pick him upeventually between driving and phoning jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot but contributes little to the story such as it is in short hes the best bit of the moviemy award for the most ironic line delivered straightfaced goes to charlton heston who when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages comments that his son looks a little out of shape whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a captain kirk corsetalso amusing is the bad guys top henchman who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy warhol for some reasonapart from these hilarities theres little to recommend this movie the ending is a sequence copied from but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from 2001tips for enjoying this movie more if you are foolish enough to watch it like i did1 any time the bomb speaks imagine its called tarquin trust me it works2 whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak preempt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as get your filthy paws off me or similar3 whenever the female lead is looking stressed this is most of the time keep hoping against hope that shes having an aneurism and will die soon4 during the interminable the ships broke again scenes keep hoping the techengineer guys will spout a scottyism like you cannae change the laws of physics or some such crapother than that do what it takes to get you through this one i dozed off half way through and woke to realise i hadnt missed anything nor had the plot laughable though it is advanced any so dont worry about tuning out for a few you wont miss anything

0,Annie Potts is the only strong point in this really dull movie Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really really upset that someone stole the corvette him and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest car to watch in a movie and heads towards the vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who stole his pride and joy would have ripped off my eyes after watching it if it was for the pleasure of watching annie potts in a very early role and it's a shame for Hamill that he didn't take some acting lessons from his danny bonaduce also made a cameo goofy

0,I didn't like this bill murray when it was released in the 80's so I tried to look at it again to see if my disgust for this film was to my tastes cinematic in the 80's or if it's just that scratches are just a bad movie well the verdict is in and scratches is a bad movienow tape may have been innovative comedy in the early 80's and it can appeal to people who have gone through the basic training or who are fans of bill murray but who are still a bad moviewhy is it bad mainly because the scratches are supposed to be a comedy but it's not that funny there are a few laughs but they are little and far between most of the film is consumed by the dramatic plot that is incredibly convolated and not very interesting this lack of comedy is particularly remarkable if you're used to more contemporary comedies like anchorman who's not looking to laugh in all the parts of the movies are not much more funny to see the wally bill and harold crazy music of bill murray's music is especially remarkable if you're a great comedian who wasn't not a much more of the funny life that's not a dramatic actor who wasn't not much more
0,"i didnt like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my moviegoing tastes in the 80s or was it that stripes is simply a bad movie well the verdict is in and stripes is a bad movienow stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans but its still a bad moviewhy is it bad mostly because stripes is supposed to be a comedy but its just not that funny there are some laughs but they are few and far between most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if youre used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the moviestripes further suffers from bill murray and harold ramiss lack of acting ability bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and harold ramis is playing harold ramis these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movielastly most of the comedy that there is in stripes revolves around bill murrays selfcentered smartalec manchild character so if you dont find that character funny like i didnt youre not going to find most of what little comedy there is in stripes funny eitherstripes is very much a movie of its era it hasnt aged well and is not worth watching if you want to watch an early 80s buddy comedy i would recommend stir crazy like stripes the humor in stir crazy is not as fastpaced as in contemporary comedies but unlike stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable

0,I thought this movie would be totally different than just another teen-slasher well I was totally wrong there is a liquid nun coming out of the toilet and something really strange I know that the Spanish culture is a bit different and their films too but I didn't expect to see a fake Hollywood movie they certainly faked quite well even why they made a movie without any new appearance it's just boring and it was made totally without any imaginationi thought that having a nun like the wrong guy in the movie would be something really original it turned out to be a teen-slasher if it was done ten years ago then it would have been something new to recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value as a horror parody in some points

0,I really can't understand how someone could give this disgusting movie more than a star how can you love such a retarded movie where all the scenes of animal abuse are real I don't even want to imagine the execrable pain these innocent and defenseless living beings felt in these horrible moments jesus what kind of humans would torture them like that for no reason or just for money I tell you that the director is either mentally retarded or just a monster with a stone heart or it really deserves to cut off his hands and burn alive contains various horribly barbaric scenes that can cause shock especially to sensitive people and children a real frog is stripped of living fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown into the water a dog is beaten from birds in the water this film is more than horrible it must be the most retarded movie ever made with another called cannibal holocaust or something like it can't watch or buy a movie directed by this heartless monster this film doesn't have to waste time when there's never a really a lot of animal abuse film
0,"i really cant understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star how can you like such a retarded film where all the animal abuse scenes are real i dont even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments jesus what kind of human would torture them like that for no reason or just for money i tell you that director is either mentally retarded or hes just a monster with a heart of stone or both he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn aliveit contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the waterthis movie is more than awful it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called cannibal holocaust or something like that ill never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster no one should waste their time watching it especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there in which all the animal abuse scenes are stagedfortunately only a few people liked this  which is natural since its the worst film ever  so it wasnt successful i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel humans will feel the same pain they once inflicted to othersthis however is probably my only negative review i usually dont comment on a movie if i dislike it but this time i just couldnt shut up i had to speak the truth because animal abuse must stop

0,with this film that only shoots 61 minutes and nothing of all that good on television I decided pop revolt zombies in the dvd to spend the time even by realizing the time when it came I was terribly disappointed that it started with the strangely optimistic quality of the opening score what no music to brood and then the rather slow opening sequences gosh I thought that a film about zombies even from the 1930s would have some chills to him white zombie with bela lugosi certainly done but it did not have zero it was hardly dramatic even except for the few moments with burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the king just as dull of zombies this film can be an interesting curiosity to possess but nothing more

0,I don't know what dragged me into the cinema to watch this film but a few minutes after he started I wanted to leave the theater for a while I was hoping at least that the story would surprise me but I realized that it was a waste of time there was nothing I was staying only because I had another show after he designed drawings where it was pretty beautiful especially from the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design they looked great while they still take posters and screenshots but not when they have to come to life they didn't work mainly because the same mistake as most of the 3d companies do technically it's very difficult to create really natural materials in 3d that would give you the feeling that the character is alive you need a lot of effort and knowledge to create something that really feels like skin tissue etc these characters were made in fabric and just couldn't be a good thing that it wasn't a bit of a bad idea to have a little idea of having a little bit of a bad idea

0,"believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like lowbudget b movies sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars it just doesnt work on so many levels for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia and the many allusions to male genitalia in a very freudian wayi am convinced this is purely from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiencesi had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character however sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen about the only kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was stupendous if this had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended to bad they didnt try that instead i just dont understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot surely it couldnt be was it the characters i doubt it i mean i could live without knowing about ed 15 was it the dialog emphatically no the music perhaps but morelikely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor

0,"facts about national lampoon goes to the movies aka national lampoons movie madness1 the movie is poor even by lampoons typical standards 2 its not funny 3 no one goes to see a movieso after i finished watching it i began wondering why on earth its called national lampoon goes to the movies and why it was ever conceived much less actually made it would be like calling austin powers an american guy goes to the movies how lame he isnt american and he doesnt go to movies none of the characters in lampoons socalled isatire are funny and none go see movies which causes a bit of a problem i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science theater 3000 but it isntthis was national lampoons first film after animal house although you couldnt tell it from the quality of film poorly developed rough and amateurish by any standard it induces headaches  not a good sign for an 89minute movie that seems double the lengthive noticed a pattern really bad movies are typically renamed  and this little disaster falls under that category it has two separate titles  probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 198283 hmm movie madness  ive never heard of this movie before lets rent it and then the realization hey wait a minute this is just national lampoon goes to the moviesit was shelved by mgmua never to be released into theaters or dvd it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade which is just about the only place youll manage to find itits split up into three stories  a parody of selfenlargement videos butter and corporate ruthlessness and police brutalitycopbuddy films i guess the first segment stars peter riegert animal house as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff im not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift until the sex scene popped uppart ii is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter dont ask who decides to become queen of the margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products ouch this contains the only funny line in the movie only i can make love with my son if you think that doesnt sound very funny youre right  its not and just imagine  its the highlight of this filmpart iii is about a cop who chases down a serial killer christopher lloyd only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy it does contain one funny scene but its extremely overacted  only lloyd really exhibits any humor playing his character dry and compassionate yet strangely surreal the part where hes choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold at least evoked a chuckle or twoits a shame to watch such a cast of semifamous names resort to low standards the writers of each segment clearly believe that theyre being very ironic and clever by spoofing socalled stereotypes  the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction favoring the standard t  a instead of plot crude humor instead of witty dialogue desperate performances instead of inspired ones its easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material muttering their lines often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camerathe movie isnt funny as i said before i laughed once at only one line and even then it was a halfhearted one two chuckles a smile and a very weak laugh compared to movie madness a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracksi like national lampoons vacation series or at least three of four installments and their classic animal house but their recent slew of directtovideo bombs such as golf punks with that great comic genius tom arnold provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago it gets really old really fastsad to see a new film called gold diggers is being released with their istamp of approval its like condemning a film before it even hits theaters  maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the placedistributor this movie is bad it gets the national lampoon stamp of approval thatll teach you not to make something so awful next timeforget the death penalty just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a monthits so bad that i cant even begin to explain its putrid vileness i give up

1,"the reign of the queen victoria is perhaps the history of the history of the most documented and well-known historical reigns in British history on the one hand, there is the theory of the ancient royals through a change of social climate and attitudes and, on the other, there is a history that is perpetuated because it is mainly human to take on the previous years of his life where the romantic burgeoning between it and the German prince albert took the foreground of the director jeanmarc valle who, until recently, has remained in the most unknown shadows of the industry here takes the history of the victorias and captures this human element so vital to his heritage his history which feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet what gives him a distinct edge of history here which separates him from the habit of making a very direct and focused approach to history that the centres in a short period of life do not need to account for the history and marriage to the young victoria knows what there is of the history of the story of the story of the story of the whole nature which does not know the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of history of history of history of history of history of the history of history of history of history of history of history of history of the history of history of the history of the history of history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of history of history of the history of the history of the history of history of history of history of history of history of history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the"
1,"the 63 year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history on the one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director jeanmarc valle who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victorias story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy its a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet thats partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual faretaking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figures entire life valle instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victorias early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal valle takes this and runs making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watchinga major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800s regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume designs sets hair styles lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victorias story without ever overencumbering it indeed while watching valles interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element and then theres the films score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes script entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and alberts story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeris original work just as wellyet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that between the sweet budding romance of victoria emily blunt and albert rupert friend and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowes screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outingsin the end its hard to fault a work such as the young victoria its got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable valle never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at making a runofthemill escapist piece for aficionados somewhere within this gray middleground lies the young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human a review by jamie robert ward

1,I liked the film most certainly let the public want to know more and there is really much more historically to discover that the production team falls to the temptation of the overdramatization especially of the shooting event there is a ton of interesting precise materials suggested to prince alberts contribution to uk and the monarchy justifies a film on its own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here the costumes and sets are particularly good but I am alone thinking that this production that judging from the length of the titles at the end was certainly not a good market that one wanted badly for an expert in short British historical label beyond the duchess of york ie actually makes princess victoria really put a whole trufflerissole in her mouth while speaking to the Prime Minister in the company of her majesty with her full mouth could never really feel that sympathetic to victoria in this film or in his shoes at least liked the case of the directors whose action was convincing so much so that we really could not know them more than one eye completely could not even know them as an observer totally informed them as a look outside

1,It is in the opinion of this critique that the best time to be a child was in the 1990s a period when cartoons were not strongly censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the waves the best producers of morning animations were on the warner television that experienced a major golden age with the dream team stevene spielberg tom ruegger and paul dini with serious and dark series like batman they also revived the zany-outlandish cartoons made famous by the animaniacs loney airs was the greatest success with its dark adult humor and tributes to the celluloid of yesteryear and today the small adventures toon was also popular by reinventing the air loney for a new generation while maintaining this madness of animated cartoon and intelligent comedy that they have always learned to all age groups whose summer drawings are only animated pieces.

1,the film is a very well made that is great and looking and directed passionately you can say that every film is thought and executed to perfection for movie lovers it is especially a great watch and they should especially be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for the cinema that is put in itself difficult to place this film under a single label sound not really a drama sound not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its plus a film with its own style that does things in its own way it does not necessarily follow the rules of the cinema and presents many different elements of different genres combined but just like the film its main character the film becomes somehow slow and boring in the parts the artistic style of the staging tries to hide that the story is actually a rather simple and sound more as if the film relies only on its style and its overall atmosphere created by the film it does not make the film horrible or whatever but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustvoir in the parts the film also feels as if its trying to be too poetic or just a little bit of a movie it just feels like it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a movie and just to let the images

1,"It's a very moving film that takes a new turn somewhere where we've all been a relationship like sound on the verge of ending the performance of kristen thomsons like Tessa desperately trying to hold on to her connection with Bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you directly into the story that has been confronted with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to scream one more lamentable night when he gives her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think how precious every relationship really close can be and how each one, permanent or not should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away"

1,This film is so much the most obvious things is the grip that the film can have on an audience and how to capture life on the film can be a kind of magic there is also the tense relationship between China and the West as many Chinese seen probably rightly so the barbarians as trying to take charge and pollute their way of life Liu even seeks to preserve their way of life on the film because it sees that it will one day disappear they also is the internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of China against the philosophy of self-determination of the West all these themes are woven quite skillfully in a coherent and pleasant ensemble by hu a very pleasant film

1,"I was finally able to see this after hearing great things about it, this film actually exceeded my expectations since the budget in question was a surprisingly competent and well done film, the lack of finance actually helped this film in several ways, especially given the intrigue as well as Blair's witchcraft project, this film was all the better to be shot on video instead of filming another bonus while most of the low-budget horror films even the best suffer from the mediocre hysterical action of this film had in fact a talented casting saving one or two characters in particular the two tracks the only missing thing of the film was an original story that he borrowed many better known films like delivery and the wrong turn but if you are like me movies of this nature never cease to be terrifying the more interesting things the director keeps all along the idea to be very interested in seeing what the director would do with a larger budget and I have the impression that it will be only a matter of time before we find out."

1,"i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score 7 out of 10

1,edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma presented in this film it is the typical alternative or independent film with a plot that presents a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantpecker is a medium boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take pictures of the exotic inhabitants of the small town where he suddenly lives an alternative artist paying attention to his work and hiring in order to expose his work in some important festivals and more but the spicy life radically changes because now the fortune and fame seem to tarnish the cities that are main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets crazy because now he does not pay adequate attention to herwell it is an indie film with one edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but I think it is worth a watch only because it offers something different than Hollywoods typical norms to describe in a few words it is the typical christina ricci and john water film thats itoh and I almost forgot to mention that the grace lines are really boring ge

1,I just watched this film and I have to say that I was very impressed by its very creepy and has many moments that will make you jump out of the seat I had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if I had to criticize id say that maybe if something there were too many jump moments it came to the point where each new scene reached a climax with a jump and it gradually used the surprising effect because you get out again what was to come although it contains practically all the shots in the ghost genre they were all so well done that it maintained the scary factor of fear that it had elements of the shine of the 6th sense and the change in particular the soundtrack reminded me the changelingi strongly would recommend that to anyone looking for a good old fear

1,it is a more beautiful film the color photography is beautiful because it shows the sumptuousness of the metropolitan opera in brilliant color other interior scenes in various hotels etc are as brilliant as for music what can be said more than that the lanzas voice was at its peak because it has sung so many worlds most known and loved arias the wonderful dorothy kirsten is also a joy that his soprano voice mixes with that of lanza in delicious harmony of course Hollywood has taken their customary freedoms with the life history of caruso there are few precious in the line of history that relates to real events for example the facts relating to his death are entirely manufactured and do not bear any relation to the truth there are some very good websites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several images of him these websites can be located using any good search engine there are also several books available regarding his life history but the line of fiction does nothing for mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the members of this film are also available to the film

1,"I finally saw this whole film and I have to say that I was very impressed Michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses not only the fact that she can act but she chooses the roles that fit her best and that are more significant and more important than what would appear to first read some comments expressing their relief that it was not something horrible feminist as they had thought before, but I certainly disagree with Diana is a feminist she follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks except her caring little brother and her coach and manager hector who turns out to be more of a father than her real parent who is what the word feminism is all to her good to see films like this one showing the true side of feminism that they are not a bunch of losers manhating but that they have dreams and can do anything Diana is true to herself that the word feminism is all to her good to see movies like this one showing the real side of feminism that they are not a bunch of losers manhating but that they have dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself that the real life can make a real person who can fall into a real life, and a real person who can fall into love, and a real person who has some kind of life, and a person who has a person who has a person who has a real life, and a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person who has a person a person who has a person who has a person a person a person a person a person who has a person a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person"

1,the time of day finished is an incredible image in a certain way its best that close encounters of the third genre I prefer independent cheeses flicks to great spectacular budgets the special effects are cheesey but that is a great part of the pleasure jim disos gives an excellent performance in this film its probably one of the best roles that it has ever had in a feature film the musical score is very good the story has no meaning but that only it is all the more intriguing like many of the best works of art the finished day time is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the time of day ended can be an independent film with low budget but it is too much of a blow to compare it with the existential European films of the fifties and sixties of which many were independent productions with low budget themselves

1,"This is a project that, in my opinion, has proven its relevance to such an infamous categorization there are not many sub-genre films last year from a multitude of countries examined and have some others to talk about my indulgence, but as it has recognized the trend as a phenomenon that it is and that there is incidentally this sexist categorization that has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans on the sides of North America I think that men are inclined to hate the work of the stepheny meyers and their descendants to a certain degree because they have the feeling of betraying that an archetype that was always their story is perhaps liberating the two men should not let themselves be caught by the death of their future wife."
1,"the vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization there were many subgenre films last year from a multitude of countries ive reviewed many and have a few more to discuss forgive my indulgence but since ive recognized the trend as a phenomenon which it is and coincidentally features my favorite horror staple im going to now move outside of north america for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didnt see as of nowof the many effects of twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies i hate this sexist categorization which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides i think men are prone to hate stephenie meyers work and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times we need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying unequally if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant cue thirst this korean film was directed by park chanwook of oldboy fame there are two ways to dissect it either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable or it is a floundering mess that doesnt decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one dont let me convince you that the film has no inclinations its director is a man whose fame is storydriven action films its protagonist is male and has a passiveaggressive interest in his lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived and his attention is returned there is a male slant to this picture yet it is not so onesided that women could not enjoy it the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moonthe plot follows an emile zola novel called thrse raquin which i have not read according to wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man he kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead mans body between them they are thus driven to insanity but care for the womans ailing mother at the novels conclusion they try to kill each other discover each others plans and commit suicidenow transcribe this nearly 150 year old french novel into modern south korea and youve got thirst chanwook doesnt embellish the story enough to elevate this to mustsee he often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration i think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative his use of the motherinlaw as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect see itthe protagonist is originally a devout christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine he thus becomes the god he once was smitten with people flock to him and view him as a grand healer ok thats really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it instead of confronting the delusional people he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patientslets continue with the christian allusion the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband her overprotective motherinlaw suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughterinlaws treachery finger waggles the man kills her but resurrects her the two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans the man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him they both die but he atones for her crimes and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominentlythe woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior she is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive vampirism magnifies their characteristics she becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge he becomes a demigod with a spirit his life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention

1,In 1962 Hong Kong in turbulent times that we are informed this extremely intimate story of a missed romance between two married people related to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old Hollywood in the scene after the scene of luxuriant colors evocative but discreet sensuality as opposed to the required sexuality and occasional naked scenes that have become part of the norm of a romance in the film and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication it is not difficult to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here because it is known for minimalism in narration as well as the description of powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters with a strong connection as well as the use of reactive scenes that could possibly take place in both characters lives from Hiroshima my love of fashionato cantabile her pen is strongly visible here as they do not seem to have had the opportunity once they had the opportunity of not having the opportunity to once from one other thing to have had a relationship with another

1,Pare bye birdie is one of the best musicals of all time but its great pleasure and accessible to many audiences the original film could have been wonderful with dick van dyke listing its role signature broadband but instead they shone with the plot so the film is very dissatisfied this remake that was broadcast on abc in 1995 is much more faithful to the original script and includes some original songs as well as which were used in a national tour that this film took from where starred tommy air and ann reinking that choreographed this filmjason alexander is a very different type of dick van dyke but it is well played as Alberta before his days seinfeld it has started in the musical theatre vanessa williams is a perfect fit for pink they is also great work of tyne daly as mae and brand Kudisch as conrad birdie a role it has played on the national tour this film is not without its problems but a major responsibility is chynna phillips that just seems to be too young to be a young world to be a little old world of teens to be just a few to be too old

1,Considered as one of the recent dramas on top of us by Hollywood this film excels where others have totally failed especially seen the most underestimated performance in the recent dramatic character portrayed by Natalie Portman this film is almost unanimously animated by the chemistry that the two susan and Natalie share they seem to be so natural during the film that you would confuse them for a real family that they are going through so many mother-daughter conflicts in history its kind of hard not to take on their acting abilities I feel that these two talented actress performances have picked up where the story was missing and almost too familiar with clichés and really saved the plot of suffering I would recommend this film mainly to those who love the two actresses or such dramas on top of the scene

1,"This is the last picture of krzysztof kieslowski one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema that he intended to retire after this film, in a certain way it is his artistic will that he died a few years after having made the film and although it was said that he intended to return to the realization of destiny decided that it was indeed his last film and which film in the three colors the French trilogy is actually a very swiss film in geneva one of the two main characters is a retired judge swiss and durenmatt immediately comes to mind, but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the absence of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops the cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will find themselves at the end in a moving and human final that only a great artist could put into scene other thing can say that it was not said and written the image's image image's image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image' image"
1,"this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski  one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to directing destiny decided that this was indeed his last and what a filmrouge the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and durenmatt immediately comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have stagedlittle else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a istudy in red as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene jacob and jeanlouis trintignant  the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age a great film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape 910 on my personal scale

1,When the British institute asked martin scorcese to create the American part of his century of the cinema series he seized the opportunity with both hands a personal comparison through American films is a wide range and as the title says a very personal look at Hollywood cinemascorcese story is mainly about Hollywood directors comedians screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention that he says from the beginning that for him the primary conflict in the film industry is that between the vision of the directors and the distributors hit between art and commercial viability he even opens with a clip of vincente minnellis the bad and the beauty of one of the first films to openly explore this contradiction what dictates the structure of the documentary scorcese looks how the genres have obscured and the cliches are disputed how the mavelicks put forward the production code and how some of his filmmakers have let themselves pass from the whole of the story he does not need to imagine his directors who have always fallen into the traps of the authors of the films who have always fallen into the traps
1,"when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of its century of the cinema series he grabbed the opportunity with both hands a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating wideranging and as the title says a highly personal look at hollywood cinemascorceses story is primarily about hollywoods directors  actors producers screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention he states right from the beginning that for him the primary conflict within the film industry is that between the directors vision and the distributors profit motive between art and commercial viability he even opens with a clip from vincente minnellis the bad and the beautiful one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction this dictates the structure for the documentary scorcese looks at how genres have darkened and clichs have become challenged how mavericks have challenged the production code and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different however scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses he lavishes praise on cecil b de mille or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonethelessscorcese doesnt necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either orson welles and alfred hitchcock two of scorceses biggest influences are only mentioned in passing instead he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his story for example he shows us a succession of john ford films to show how the western evolved he looks at the work of vincente minnelli probably the most often referenced director of the documentary to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents i can imagine that had this assignment not been limited to america scorcese would have also loved to talk about for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell as it is he stretches the definition of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw murnau billy wilder and douglas sirk as well as the work of usborn filmmakers that was produced elsewhere  such as that of stanley kubrickrather than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically scorcese compares films from various eras in order to tackle various subjects in his section on the language and tools of cinema he begins with dw griffith looks at the coming of sound colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects which although scorcese is not keen on them he is evenhanded enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them however he doesnt simply finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it instead he then rewinds back to the 1940s to show how a lowbudget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest of elementsa personal journey through american movies has to be one of the best film documentaries made there were a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have discovered without and even the most seasoned of film buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope scorcese has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures i was pleased to see that when he talks about kubrick in his iconoclasts chapter he looks at lolita and barry lindon for me his two most underrated films scorceses respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully rather than just giving us tiny bits and he interrupts them with talking heads a combination of archive and new interviews only when necessary there is a bit of bias towards the 40s and 50s but that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema and after all i dont think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journeyone word of warning though in its in depth look at certain pictures this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers

1,I've seen a lot of ppvs in the past but it's the most entertaining pvs and the most complete dvd I've ever seen the dvd extras because they give a different view of how the wrestlers act after the show as a benoit chris interview an overview of the era of the Monday evening wars the first game of hogan winning gold title and a promotional discussion in addition there is a good video 1 tag team table match bubby ray and chip dudley vs eddie guerro and chris benoit 710 it was a pretty good intense match to start the show not too many holds and just raw physical chilli can hold its own in the tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure fighting skills on the mat 2 wwe crusier game noble w nidia v billy kidman 310 the crowd really interested until people expect a lot of game games not really understand that the game happened

1,This is the best directtodvd effort of van damme that I saw yet van damme plays a border patrol agent that is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross in the United States the action in this movie is great and the fighting scenes row with van dammes best costar scott adkins shows why it should be the next great star in the genre of martial arts to more extensive evidence check undisputed 2 adkins is so good in fact that before I watched the shepherd I thought that van damme might not seem very credible to defeat him on the screen van damme holds his own good and although he is just as athletic as adkins he can still kick with the best of them all the fighting scenes in this movie are very well done and the battles of arms are above average for this type of film so the only negative thing I can say about this film is that the story is a little underdeveloped you think van dammes is doing that film it should have been presented in the film for a very reason that it's not really cool that it's not a reason that it's going to have been presented in the film in a very early time

1,although this film changes the reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing the Custer this remains the best movie made on the Custer the music of max steiner is beautiful and also all through the film the Irish song Gerry Owen that was a favorite of Custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the villains in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de Havilland runs like in no other out of their films together and the director Raoul Walsh with his experience in the outdoor scenes with many actors is at his best

1,I would recommend this film to everyone not only to the fans of the luciano ligabue rocker but to all the moviebuffs because his sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is a storyteller born and a lover of the film and each frame of his film is made with love and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved because most of the first Italian films are lousy and this one made by a stranger is a real joy to watch and listen because stefano accorsi is beautiful and reminds me Andrea pazienza who was as beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is not glamorous and ugly without hardening himself in easy moralisms because it is a film that speaks to our hearts our souls and because I experienced the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like this thanks to luciano

1,the art of absurd is alive and prosperous in the current Danish cinema well at least it is in this film that no one in this film are amused they are all either bored or shocked and if they are still they will soon be it is a story of damn murder embarrassment dignity and to the end love and redemption the embarrassing humorous style is idiomatic and hilly to everyone but personally I found that it just has the fascinating mixture just of weird and absurd pity you the characters even as you hate them close and personal but their story is so tragic that you find in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even when they get away with the murder that is certainly in my opinion the best Danish movie of the last years9 of 10

1,It is easy to love first that I can rely on great production values because very few Italian films today can with wonderful sets and costumes the cast is great too director virz constantly speaks of the young lead elio germano as a young of Niro now of course it goes far too far but sure that the boy can act I liked his performance and he did a great job with the tuscan accent Daniel auteuil is a great actor and has done very well as bonaparte his really great to see him act in Italian I hope to see him work in Italy very quickly cast support has worked well also people like valerio mastrandrea or saabrina impacciatore may seem unlikely choices but they all gave beautiful performances even massimo ceccherini better known to appear in his own moronic films and in reality tv trashy shows well the bottom point of the cast is the diva monoica bellucci much more than usual she managed to realize that she is not always wiser than she does not know yet

1,"In the thirties and thirties, each of the great studios seized jazzy onerelers with a universal grip while most looked as cheap on the screen as they had to make warner buddies who abruptly stopped doing them in 1946 often distinguished them with mirrors of staggered camera angles and optical effects thanks to some creative directors like Jean negulesco it is appropriate that the best of this kind should come from this studio what puts yellow the blues apart from the rest of the pack is that it looks more closely like an avant-garde experience than a Hollywood music filmed in July 1944 it perhaps transforms a session of ordinary jam into a dream trippy landscape of war troubles highlighted by the air on the sunny side of the street gjon mili and cameraman robert burkes later on to work with hitchcock was allowed a lot of artistic freedom perhaps because the young Lester was not glenn miller two times and the studio might not be able to deal with many of his companions yet more than he did with the optical ones."

1,I saw the Prime Minister of this film at the Phoenix Film Festival 2005 and I was very impressed by the talented director Jeff Hare exposed by bringing this timely topic to the screen casting of perfectly mixed characters and we allowed to examine the question of a senior wanting to die in his own words in a very warm and humorous way Peter Falk was brilliant as morris and the support group of family members and friends were perfectly played in their roles the interaction of family friends and strangers with morris created a realistic vision of how families approach the issue of their aging parents and their desire to die with dignity even if this film is ostensibly a film about a Jewish actor and his family is really a film about all families the jokes of the family and morris during this Roma crack through the life of a force of nature are new and realistic childhood rivalries successes and failures and hope for the children are integral to this scenario while many of the jokes of the family and morris crack during this romian by the life of a force of nature are new and realistic successes and failures and the hope for the children are part of this scenario as well as you will have to laugh about how to make a suicide some movie so much as you may think of how to make a suicide

1,"who knew dowdy queen victoria the plump monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband prince albert actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days the young victoria not only chronicles the young queens romance with her husbandtobe but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the thronethe act i isetup draws you in right away following the death of victorias father the duke of kent in 1820 less than a year after victorias birth the duchess of kent eventually hooked up with former army officer john conroy who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queentobe conroy insisted that victoria be raised under the atrocious kensington system rules designed to prevent the future queen from having any contact with other children while growing up whats more victoria was forced to sleep in her mothers bedroom everyday until she became queenthe film explains that in 1830 parliament passed the regency act which established that victorias mother would become regent and hence guardian in the event that victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor during this time the duchess and conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making conroy her private secretary and treasurer strongwilled victoria would have none of it and refused to go along with conroys and her mothers nefarious plans the duchess disliked king william as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the monarchy the king felt the duchess disrespected his wife as a result the duchess attempted to limit victorias contact with the king in an overthetop scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history the king berated the duchess at his birthday banquet stating that it was his goal to survive until victoria reached her 18th birthday so that her mother would not become regentking william kept his word and died a short time after victoria became eligible to accede to the throne victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of conroy whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable they were both banished to a secluded apartment in buckingham palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her motherthe young victoria conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding victorias coronation as queen a good part of the film deals with victorias relationship with lord melbourne the whig party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was in the beginning melbourne gains the young queens trust and they become good friends in the early years of her reign she sees melbourne as a progressive but later loses respect for him somewhat as hes revealed to be a typical politician hiding his contempt for the masses whom hes supposed to be championing in reality melbourne was more a father figure to victoria but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert as though they were romantic rivalsthe plot thickens when melbourne is forced out and the queen must commission sir robert peel of the more conservative tory party as the new prime minister the film chronicles the events of the bedchamber crisis in which peel resigned after victoria refused to replace some of her bedchamber ladies with the wives of tory politicians the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady hastings one of the duchesss ladiesinwaiting who was accused of having an affair with john conroy and becoming pregnant by him because of her hatred for conroy victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about hastings alleged pregnancy as it turned out hastings only appeared pregnantwhat she actually had was an abdominal tumor victorias inexperience shows during the bedchamber crisis but the films scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the hastings affairthe rest of the the young victoria deals with  of course  the romance between the queen and prince albert victoria kept albert waiting as the film makes clear since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new sovereign they spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until albert returned to england and gave victoria support during the trying times of the bedchamber crisisi find a good number of parallels between prince albert and prince philip the current queens husband while philip is mainly danish he went to school in germany and had inlaws who were of german background both albert and philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the court theres a great scene where albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for king george iii even though he had been dead for years alberts struggle was the same for philipas husbands of monarchs they had to find something to do both albert and philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didnt have to live continually in the shadow of their everpopular wivesfortunately theres an excellent scene toward the end of the film where albert infuriates victoria with what she perceives as his interference in her affairs albert doesnt want a second bedchamber crisis so he goes over his wifes head and arranges a compromise involving victorias bedchamber ladies victoria is barely talking to albert when an assassins bullets almost cuts them both down in the film albert is shot in the arm but this never happenedthe performances in the film are uniformly excellent especially the principals emily blunt and rupert friend the young victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography no mention of victorias depression after alberts death but victoria is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson

1,It is a striking story that borrows elements of the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent Western tale film has a good musical score although it rests on repeating the theme title a little too giuliano gem and the rest of the distribution are superb it is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on the story than the action and it succeeds because the story is excellent it is not to say that there is no action in the film there is a lot and it is very well designed this film pulls you in and keeps you absorbed until the end you always wonder what in these documents everyone after it also has some biting comments on American politics this film shows why valerii in my opinion is in three sense related with sollima and corbucci for the second place in the ranking of the directors spaghetti western spaghetti

1,This one that came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle because it has this kind of mature mood and distance dealing with the subject we simply observe that the story unfolds without taking sides or having to face moral issues or of course we are but are not spicked they are sure that there were some facts difficult to face and choices to make but it just sank basically it was just like any other love story in any other life with any other sexi personally found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outings the only thing I could really point out as a problem would be it just felt a kind of guarded back his step on the sex scenes or those missing but since I felt the film at his Liveliest during the moments that they were together having a good time it is a kind of contrast with the baskey rest is good but it just never enough stunned as an annabelle magnet nor touched as much as it says I recommend heart sound by no waste of precious time on the contrary7

1,I really liked this movie and it was a little hard to do that when your brother makes stupid comments in this movie never 30 seconds but this movie I enjoyed mainly because im used to the usual hk action movies most of the movies like this one don't look for the line of history watch for the insane action and mental action is just you get to see jet li jump spin punch making impossible jumps and avoid countless bullets his truth that this film was released to a wider audience after li was in the deadly weapon 4 which is one of the reasons why the notes on this movie dropped most people probably expected to see a film that was as polite as a North American movie but you need to remember most of the hk film budgets are almost as high as a North American movie and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually demanding in a wired work in many of them if you want to see a good action film you should see that just try to ignore the double note was a 8

1,"although i live in minnesota i have been studying in france lately and came across this bizarre gem of a filmthis movie was amazing to say the least a creative and unique film the different directors each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light the first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall storyline much as can be done with 2003s love actually this attempt however renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete when taken at face value with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film the love stories together tell a beautiful messagethe film is strikingly bizarre at times  often to the point of confusion  and each individual segment can be hard to follow still to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments the short plot lines become clear after a short time the confusion is almost intriguing it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next it leaves the viewer wondering did that really just happen yet also leaves them satisfied that it did indeed occur its the kind of movie where the viewer upon leaving the theater cant actually decide whether they loved it or they hated it the initial reaction is to go and watch it again and again just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiecethe interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate it adds to the reality of the film  here the american tourists speak english the parisians french and so on the number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of lovefrom sickness to the supernatural the love of parents to the love of husbands this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling in its beautiful and quirky way each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story that of all types sizes nationalities and shapes of love

1,"fulci is one of my favorite Italian directors, it is also a very good storyteller mixing horror the supernatural and psychedelic themes quite well this film was really his last great story before he realized disappointments such as voices beyond the story is simple that fulci plays a horror director after years of shooting splattered films and gore it seems that fulci starts to suffer from a breakdown in which he begins to hallucinate on the people who have been massacred he decides to see a psychiatrist who does not do worse when he convinces fulci that he kills peoplefulci used scenes gore of several images at the same time these films I do not believe that he made but certainly produced some of these films are massacres made by andrea biani funeral land touch of death directed by fulci the secret of the murders and I cannot remember the rest of the concert of movies nightmare is a film very underestimated even by the fans fulci several times, but I do not know how many times it is fulci"

1,"It is a film that has an impressive rhythm and whose personalities of cinematography play in the Dallas region the diversification of the characters so as not to mention the olive stone of the director and, of course, the film that starts on Friday suggests that it is occult in the first place and begins with a radio station in Dallas that hosts the number one presentation of the television program based on the host of the radio alan bergbarry eric bogasian is the host of the presentation of the abrasive radio and its work is such that it is mandatory to bridge all the sensational nuances of the public of the radio that eats from its television program by trying to communicate them with a group of societal inversions transformed by calling solitary obscenes who have the desire to be the publication of the history of the radio and that the dominant concepts get rid of the entire publication of the information."
