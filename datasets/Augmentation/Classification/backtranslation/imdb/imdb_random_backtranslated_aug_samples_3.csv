0,"I can only describe this film as strange shares of screenplay and credit production on this film, but I really find it hard to believe that he would choose to express himself on his own voice for so many of his lines with a voice of thin impostors no less than what I don't get is that if they had to double some of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them, I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us, but the Seagal of this film barely releases a fraction of the same confidence bravado charm and sexappeal that he so easily showed us in all his previous films what I found missing especially was his self-assured attitude and his badas sneer that moves so easily in this adorable smile where is this attitude and that charm inyour face that made him such a star that I hope this film is not an indication of what we have left of Seagal that we have done so long that it has been so long for us that it has been so long for us that we have been"

0,is not the horror movie this one is actually a love storythe ring is a silent movie of 1927 that features two boxers and the woman who comes between them she loves the boxer known as a Jack round that she loves until the champion arrives along that is even if she marries a round she openly starts flirting with the champion until the last boxing climate fight between a round and the champion she returns to a round corner just when things look like their darkest and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win her wife love back this film was very early in the career but the limits of time did not have to make her make a sustainable film although there are special movie tricks and some relief of the comedy this film does not care about any of her later work it must have been extremely risky for the time period even if with the shameful wife who might have been the draw in 1927 while watching all these old films could be on the screen it could be amazing how I think about the movie today I'm thinking about the timeless wife who could be the drawing in 1927 who might be looking at all those old films and might be on the screen

0,"I just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to start with was still disappointed the most flagrant error in this abomination of a movie is that the main point of intrigue that the guy being awake during the operation had nothing to do with the result, he would have ended up in the same way regardless of what was the point of what also knows this surgeon had 4 lawsuits for professional misconduct against him and he didn't think that people would ask questions if a patient died on his table giving me a Jessica alba break is completely untalented and Christiansen is almost as bad as everything was laughable from the beginning to the end quite certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel you would be in more pain than that"

0,a lot of people thought it's a good movie but I don't agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship so hey killed some people on earth but for no reason also it's in a dark forest I don't see anything on the screen I can hardly hear the sound after a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the director of the aliens and killed for no reason that he wasn't alive on earth t is not of his business about the things that have happened here lately the length of the film is only 90 minutes the summary is too short and he can't tell the examiners about the story clearly in conclusion I don't think it's a good movie

0,This film is just as bad as the ornithologist of alcatraz i does not refer to the actor but rather to the premise of the two films that try to portray psychopath criminals as heroic figures. It bothers me when well-respected actors like alan alda and burt lancaster play such roles because their status tends to give credibility to the directors who intend to raise the subject of films a social anticasti was in the junior high school in the last years of life of the caryl chessboarders and his calls and books of death penalty were very in the news I remember the field of opinion that the death penalty was false and the chessboarders were the victim of a grip the people read the history chess was a criminal and sexual predator that he drove in the streets at night with a police fire stolen in his vehicle he stopped cars with attractive women inside under the trick of making an arrest of traffic then kidnapped and raped women rape and much may prefer to suffer the worst trauma that a woman may suffer and they prefer to suffer the worst trauma that a woman may suffer

0,ok this movie was really unique if we say Carrie fisherman was by far the most talented in the movie even if we say she had a coke problem during the movie but she said she can't remember a lot of that although her excuse but what's all the others I can't imagine they all had a coke problem anything it wasn't so bad I guess I guess the plot was okay and he had a couple of funny moments although the part where the guy gets this stuff stuff stuffed in his head was a little too violent for my taste oh well I guess I was disappointed because Carrie fisherman is like so great and this movie didn't do anything for her.

0,It is therefore a film in the process of learning to the democratic republic of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from the Belgian domination. It is also a question of learning with the figures involved in its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new Congolese government tried to bring together the different groups opposed to colonial domination the political motives behind each one the reasons behind the decision of Belgiums to give the rc its independence and also how the United States and the former usr were sadly involved all my questions were largely unanswered my belief is that this film was made by people who through a familiarity past with the history of the rcs are fighting for freedom a story filled with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they then tried to store all the dramatic points in a scenario briefly filled with the dialogue went to the place and did not take it into account in the whole story.

0,"so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule the political motives behind each one the reasons behind belgiums decision to give the drc its independence and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing familiarity with the story of the drcs fight for freedom saw a story filled with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them out with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so its all the sadder because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history whatever the reason the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentencelong statements and facts printed on the screen the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer pointblank the main idea of whats going on completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things for instance there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with lumumba one that vilifies lumumba and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying orders correspondingly there are three soldiers that speak in the scene uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view then to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and thats that theres little telling through actions even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness its hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also in the trend of this directness things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact we never learn what these factions are what theyre fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the characters likewise are onedimensional and flat unfortunately i dont know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didnt trust it to tell me so the drc like many developing countries has a complicated and important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines

0,I loved the Batman TV series and I was really looking forward to that but they tried to do too much why they had the story of Adam West and Burt Guard trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me I don't want to hit Burt or Adam for the way they're watching now they've been 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin but seeing them dressed up in costumes and fighting badguys was a bit sad I would just prefer to see the exstars make comments the batmobile story was stupid for the flashback film I think it was too short and left out far too much it was really a quick preview in my opinion id as more background they showed the penguin and joke for about a minute each just to say the same thing I already knew that the joker had a moustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though it was an exmoker and was an exsmoker who was on those 2id love to read the book I am sure that it was 2 was a cat or had to get rid of it there or had to get rid of it 3

0,It's a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle-aged children of the middle school maybe to them its funny they can even see something frightening in it for me the actor is poor and the plot is poor there's just little value at all for the adult viewer I saw this film as weak and boring sometimes there was the possibility that the film could become interesting but it never really materialized the creatures seem good enough but after seeing them for a few seconds they don't seem to have any substance other than the look at times I wasn't sure if the film was trying to make another comedy attempt or was just another horror attempt that failed this just movie was not good for me

0,I doubted its importance for the cinema queer because it seems to be more to have a homosexual encounter by violent behavior than to make clear statements about homosexuality and violence three tales are entangled together in a rather slender way I found myself trying to unravel the petty narrative in the first 15 minutes that only did not sit well with me weak points of conspiracy were endless as if we had not got it the first 10 times there was a feeling of dialogue padded in all the film more like a 45 minutes boys short rather than a full-length satid film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and the call to sex but overall the sum did not equal its parts the first part boxerstalker story was the strongest and yet it had the impression that it had been pulled thin bob followed a tim for four years and only now it was wanted his school I had the impression that his game of cat was not so much so much as it needed the information that it was not so much so much as to conclude that it was not so much so much that it was necessary for us that it was not so much so much that it was not so much that it was not so much that it was not so much that it was not so much that it was not so much that it was not so much that it was not so much that it was not so much that it was not so much that it was not that it was not so much that it was not that it was not so much that it was not that it was not that it was that it was that it was not that it was not that it was that it was not that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was not that it was that it was not that it was that it was that it was not that it was not that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was not that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was not that it was not that it was that it was that it was not that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was not that it was not that it was that it was that it was that it was not that it was not that it was not that it was not that it was that it was that it was that it was not that it was

0,"first of all season 1 is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional theyre nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchairbound augustus hill who is played impressively by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with whats taking place in the showunfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a mens club with guards guards that dont do much near the end of season two an older prisoners grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of 20 and 50 bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even adibisi wanted to be nice but thats okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distractionlater shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators lets see what else shillingers son ods in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he justgot them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise youll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums i didnt know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr farajs schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and oreilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a guni shouldnt go on about stupid ideas in this show but its like a flood i cant stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who cant speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless theyre needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robsons gum transplant whats the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesnt belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again its like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mindi also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they dont say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you dont think im gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience wont remember maybe im spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a lowbudget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multiseason tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i dont understand myself

friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators lets see what else shillingers son ods in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he justgot them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise youll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums i didnt know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr farajs schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and oreilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a guni shouldnt go on about stupid ideas in this show but its like a flood i cant stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who cant speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless theyre needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robsons gum transplant whats the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesnt belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again its like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mindi also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they dont say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you dont think im gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience wont remember maybe im spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a lowbudget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multiseason tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i dont understand myself

0,"This movie started as a decent enough movie but it never really started instead it became predictable and even a little stupid some scenes were pretty well done photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and so made a little more interesting to watch, but as the story was rather slow, it did not manage to keep interest alive and more important is not scary at all sound supposed to be a horror film but there was not a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting to be frank the actors were all that great is no colorful characters that you will remember for the rest of your days an observable film but it adds nothing and once you finished watching it it will not last long until its already forgotten the reason that I watched it was because I had read a review giving it the best scores but I do not agree and instead of grade 4 of 10 if you still want some kind of Japanese horror I suggest you look at Juon rather"

1,first I have to say that this film is much less pretentious than the da vinci code sure that you have religion vs the problem of science but it does not try to make a great statement about it fundamentally a thriller of action that moves from one scene to the other very well a scene especially that involves fire I found extremely well done second the changes of the book to the film although when I was following the development of the film I was complaining about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others I have to admit that I was wrong it was refreshing that the film did not follow the book exactly as it was done in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them can upset you though though however the great twist is still there so do not worry about this finally im happy that they have removed some stupid subplates and do not even try to invoke the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary film that is ok because it offers mainly for 9 a movie that is ok because it offers mainly for 9 a movie that is ok

1,"First of all I have to say that im portuguese and that it is not usual for me to spend my time watching Portuguese films probably one every year or even none and the reason is the almost generalized idea between the Portuguese that the national images are really very close to the worst ever done however in the last decade it starts to surprise me when we get the funny of the 40s when leo da estrela e costa do castelo were among the best worlds of their time with films like Pulsao zero or comes nula both from the director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in common this one is not so good of the same kind because it is a real comedy in fact officially a drama a dramatic woman has them funny unexpected parts because of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical journey to the Caribbean just to get the works of the plot and can surprise us a few times that the actors are regular like the score, but the truth is that we can all count as a national option that you can take all the effort for a good cinema to get the work of the plot."

1,the film is a very well made that is great and looking and directed passionately you can say that every film is thought and executed to perfection for movie lovers it is especially a great watch and they should especially be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for the cinema that is put in itself difficult to place this film under a single label sound not really a drama sound not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its plus a film with its own style that does things in its own way it does not necessarily follow the rules of the cinema and presents many different elements of different genres combined but just like the film its main character the film becomes somehow slow and boring in the parts the artistic style of the staging tries to hide that the story is actually a rather simple and sound more as if the film relies only on its style and its overall atmosphere created by the film it does not make the film horrible or whatever but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustvoir in the parts the film also feels as if its trying to be too poetic or just a little bit of a movie it just feels like it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a movie and just to let the images

1,I saw this film as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such an unfinished ending that I grew up on many great anime films and it was one of my favorites because it was such an unusual story about injustice and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that can't be cancelled and the need for other chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is also alone when the chirin follows him in the mountain the wolf doesn't kill the lamb even if every night he may say wrong eat tomorrow the tape that I was broken and degraded from age and use I will repair it and watch the film one day and cry just as hard as I did like a child stories like that with this depth and that feeling and intricality of meaning are very rare it's a sad story but ive never met any catharsis more beautifully made I am happy I saw this film and I'm happy that I saw it as a child

1,"in 2004 I wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our life was a film forgotten for me watching this film is like opening a time capsule I think in many ways the best years of our life is probably one of the most fascinating character studies and it holds extremely well as a look at the life in us in the mid 1940s after wwii I believe that coming home and the deer hunter both released in 1978 were the most recent films that were closest to capture the many problems of the military men returning from the war that were raised in the best years of our life what really impressed me is to watch the film in its entirety when I was at the university around 198081 and many, if not all the students of the college applauded at the end of the film this film is still a wallop and im very happy to read in other posts of other users feeling of a film that will certainly resist the test of time im very happy to see the film ranked close to the 100 movies on imdb and afi's still much more classic lives that is finally a competition with our lives that is still more than just what we have been in our lives"
