0,the views of the earth that are claimed in this film to have been falsified by nasa have recently been compared with the historical meteorological data for the time of apollo 11 and show a good correspondence between the models of clouds in the video sequence and the actual rain recordings on the day that would seem to undermine the whole argument presented in the film that the image of the entire earth is actually a small part of the planet framed by the window of the spacecraft i am waits that bat sibrel now to pretend that the historical weather data have been falsified by nasa although this would certainly not involve them in replacing each copy of a journal archived by a meteorological map and that those in private hands would still be a problem an answer trying to discredit this film by referring to nasa weather data id say that it is a charming but weak and gullible argument what on the rest of the images and evidence in the film a certain wise man once said something about mosquitoes if and swallowing camels does not seem to be proof that the secret data come from what does not know what does not mean to you that it is proof that what does not know what does not to you what does not know what does not to do to what does not to what does to what does to what does to what does to what does not to what does not to what does to what does to what does to what does not know what does not to what does not to what does not to what does to what does to what does to what does not to what does to what does to what does to what does to what does to what does to what does to what does to what does to what does not to do to what does.

0,"one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins one of the most serious examples in 19th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of goldbearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult thus the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by warnerfirst we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor a very rare treatment in 1938 a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldnt seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations then we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero to be paired with olivia de havilland among other things this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it even the usually colorful gabby hayes in his small role seemed unusually subdued unfortunately i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems it needed to be more like the good earth released just the year before just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man such as errol flynn finally there is the matter of the inane title surely warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title gold or grain is short and to the point incidentally i understand there is still plenty of gold in them thar hills waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining

0,"as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film i sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch the beginning quotation from the new testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in mewhy to entail a sentence from the gospel by mark in the movie about pagan rome but the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple caligula and drusilla running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised in me quite soon particularly at the death of tiberius the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during the second half of the film i felt as if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the end i said to myself this is one of the movies that one may really hate  i am aware that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of taste i hate this film due to many reasons but particularly onecaligula does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic which it claims to be but bob guccione the director and the founder of penthouse pornographic magazine aims at combining film art with porn that is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused of movie is an art that should be reigned by taste by message by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste caligula shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked decadent manner some scenes are so disgusting that i dont think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them some say that the rome under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it is true corruption bloomed at that time various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens yet i do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic i believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies huge historical mistakes the screenplay by gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of proculus donato placido a historic roman senator yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes moreover livia was not proculus wife raped by caesar on her wedding what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence another example of historical travesty is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren she is presented as caligulas wife together with drusilla his sister in fact caligula married caesonia long after the death of his sister the sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases i also hated the moment with the killing machine  a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts technical aspect and cast from the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall raises the value of the film if everything bothers you in caligula you may at least admire his performance i also fancied helen mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy as drusilla yet the film is based on a gossip by suetonius that caligula made love to his sister sir john gielgud as nerva and peter otoole as old tiberius are also memorable otoole does his finest piece of acting in the capri grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor yes i admit that the only thing i like about caligula are the performances therefore i dont rate the movie 110lame continuity the historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity let us analyze just the beginning caligula comes to capri grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old tiberius then after about 15 minutes the action moves to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a bad omen and immediately the characters are again in capri where nerva john gielgud is dying all in all i dont recommend to see caligula to anyone if you want to know the story read robert graves gorgeous novel i claudius and claudius the god or watch herbert wises mini series with the magnificent performance by derek jacobi caligula is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never be called an epicthere are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen peoples taste of beautythere are movies that are average entertainment yet they have something to offerthere are movies that show extreme violence yet they still convey some moralthere are however movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula unfortunately belongs to the latest group

0,I heard so much about this movie how it was a big slasher and one of those movies from the early 80s that die from the hard fans of most of the slasher movies just had to see well that I rented it and I have to say that even though it kept my attention until the suspense goes for most of the slasher movies such as Friday April 13th and the night of the ball this movie could have been just there with the mentioned top only it really lacked enthusiasm and potential of the characters as well as the characters of the current story that I found unhappy to be in this movie was the weird guy with frizz hair that was shooting around the dormitory and of course leading to his true climatic role during the end with him facing the killer another would be the dirty guy who was watching with the hard jacket that he could have played more roles in this movie that could have made the movie more interesting instead of playing this guy like another loser there making unknown calls while he was sleeping with his little friend and then he could have made the less money out of the movie that he was doing the less of the movie that he was making money

0,the atmosphere of this film is quite good and it captures the sensation of the 80s well with a good show the script is launched from the mill with the exception of a couple of comic moments and comes out as being strange where I wait for it to be intended to be edgy the characters are totally dramatized and incredible and full of clichés of right wing that the screenwriter has probably seen watching a panoramic documentary on the national front the biggest problem is that this film does not have any real history it ticks all the good arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was very disappointing

0,spoilers excuse the first word that popped into the mind while watching the movie is gremlins it's the only shit movie I saw from the four movies but I liked it was not too complicated as I had seen the last two but I thought it was a very good movie all the same critters start with a man his son and his daughter stopping on the way to vacation although it turns out they end up at their own house that I have no idea what hell went on the girl meets a boy played by Leo dicaprio and they're going to hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and things because of the critters it seems a little psychotic and if I were in this situation I wouldn't talk to him about stealing a girl's car and the boys and end up in their flat version they hide in the basement and end up killing that big woman and the girls dad they're being chased up until they've forgotten in the stuff
0,"spoilers  sorry the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is gremlins its the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies but i enjoyed it it wasnt too complicated as i hadnt seen the past two but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same critters starts with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home  which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a boy played by leo dicaprio and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boys car and end up in their flat thing they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girls dad they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the critters eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene and i cant remember not a good thing but im sure they have to go back for somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he cant because they are endangered and so he sends them homethe ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off its a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if youre looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies sorry

0,I think it would be a more appropriate title for this movie because it is padded to hell and back with stock images of various bugs and animals I recently found the prey in its original form vhs big box and was very excited I just like to find old movies slasher on vhs because the cover is fantastic generally although it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic the prey is one of those movies to be just it started ok with the killer stalking teens clichés in the woods the sounds of heart beat used are a great effect that makes you tense while you look at this film is basically a fat big cliché and when the section of campfire stories rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the time running on the back of the killer I actually thought it was a pretty original idea but the backstory ends abruptly and shows us a little stock foot of a burning forest the lack of budget really starts showing now after that we went back to the blind teen being even more shamed up a little bit of a little bit bit of a hit-

0,"There was no experience of science in the 1970s, there are people who think of the galactica war, they remember different things for some it's the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor for others it's the sympathy they had for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time many forget the state of the special effects in the late 1970s especially those on television for some memories solve around the history of others remember how the relations themselves overcome the challenges they frequently called me from this last group they did not have time to play television people who came together to save each other from an evil empire the cylons had nothing to gain, but the extermination of the human race they did so when the basic stars did not have time to live with men and women, they had more time to live with men and women."
0,"rating 4 out of 10as this miniseries approached and we were well aware of it for the last six months as scifi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned moreas with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time different people go to it to see different things in this regard when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different things for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor for others it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s especially those on television for some the memories resolve around the story arc others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they facedfrankly i come from the latter group the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire yes evil the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it while base stars were swirling around men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources and somehow they managed to survive until the next show they didnt survive because they had better technology or more fire power they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next showthe show had its flaws and at times was sappy but they were people you could care aboutthe writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show the characters names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction since that was their goal they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure it was far from a reinvention in fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time it borrows liberally from sttng stds9 babylon 5 and even battlefield earth i find that unfortunateronald d moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d  e that was the inviolable rule of roddenberrys sttng like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master gene roddenberry here instead of writing the best story possible he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could besides being dysfunctional some of it was not the least bit believable anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack they could have gotten execution and they never would have gotten out the next day it wouldnt have happened period especially in time of warthe thing that i remembered most of ron moores earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt james kirk he killed capt kirk and alas for me he has killed battlestar galactica

0,"He says that when South African Europeans arrived too far north, they fell into zulus and tribes other than herds of cattle and crops planted so that what explains their lack of economic and artistic technological achievements if they had the key things that the author claims to be necessary to succeeddiamond too, claims that the germs in the form of smallpox brought to North America by his black slaves were our greatest weapon although 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 indigenous warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 zulus without a single victim in both cases so I think you have to conclude that the germs are unimportant with or without germs that we are going to succeed he says that malaria has prevented Europeans from colonising further north killing thousands of Europeans while not affecting Africans as if they were to know real numbers, but he thinks that it is necessary to conclude that the germs are irrelevant with or without germs that we are going to succeed it seems that Europeans have stopped killing thousands of Europeans and that they have had the chance of having the chance of having the seeds."
0,"jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didnt have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machinesbut then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that herded cattle and planted crops so what explains their lack of technological economic and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for successdiamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox brought to north america by black slaves were our biggest weapon well if 150 europeans can defeat 20000 native warriors and 400 nonmilitary south africans can defeat 10000 zulus without a single casualty in either case then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant with or without germs we were going to succeedhe says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north killing thousands of europeans while not affecting africans id like to know real numbers but he doesnt say then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of africans and that is why they cant catch up with us so which is it jared did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them and how come europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories hes reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it its sad watch this obvious neomarxist contort reality to try to prove his point

0,on the surface this film would seem to deal with the psychological process called individuation which is how to become a real self by kissing the so-called dark side of human nature so we have the darkening of a classic evil creature desperately looking for the enterprise that is the recognition of men and the story revolves around the different ways that this need is treated more or less successfully however if we dig a bit further we find that this film is how you should report to your car as you want to any other person in the opening scene the main man mechanical car character fallen from graces collect pieces and car parts wrecked with his daughter when a car wreck almost crushes the little girl lesson 1 cars are people incarnated with immortal souls and car theft wrecked is identical to a serious theft the bad guys have disturbed death and must be punished just after another rubin character who buys a car wrecked inside himself realizes that most people realize the quality of a car just as a single person can be replaced by the other person who does not be replaced by the other person who does not be the same as the other person.

0,"It's a young couple who runs away to start a new life in La that ends up being hunted by a psychopath at a desert rest but it really seems his right one about the nicole girl since her boyfriend literally disappears in a few minutes the film goes extremely fast and early on you wonder how it might be possible to stretch his long-term story it is not long before you realize that the film does it simply by wasting time with useless scenes that go nowhere the story is not only paperthin but inconsistent minutes after the disappearance of his boyfriend and his nicole car finds a mobile home at rest she sees the flash of a camera and knows that people are inside but she easily gives up trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks after being informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger when she walks around a bottle of alcohol even stopping without taking care of stupid and useless things it consists of shooting on a TV and even stopping at a movie and even stopping at a terrible time when she even stops working on a movie, she stops working on a movie, and stops even stopping on a movie, and stops working on a movie, she stops even stops working out on a movie, and stops even stops working on a movie, and stops himself"
0,"this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop actually its really just about the girl nicole since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes the movie gets going extremely fast and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length it isnt long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowherethe story is not only paperthin but unstructured stupid and incoherent minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop she sees the flashing of a camera and knows that people are inside but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger she walks around the rest stop doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things this includes turning on a tv and even looking amused when she thinks shes stumbled onto a porno movie even in this dire situation sitting around wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end she does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been abducted that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety she doesnt bother to lock the doors or remain alert oh yeah she tries using a radio to call for help but why even bother when theres a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop it really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the storytheres no sense of entrapment or everpresent danger in this story the heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her before driving off again theres nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else thats better than sitting around but she chooses to stay anyway at one point in the movie the main character even acknowledges that she can run off but doesntthe story doesnt go anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets inside the mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics they seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killers actions but theres no indication that theyre connected to him in any way and then kick nicole out after several minutesin the next irrelevant segment the main character wanders into the bathroom building she discovers one of the killers previous victims a young woman named tracy who is still alive and locked in a closet for some strange reason tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door and when she returns a minute later both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation what was the point nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons and sees that tracy had disappeared in 1971 so was tracy a ghost or something the writer never bothers explainingnext a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop which had been conveniently left unattended for the entire day so far nicole tells him all about whats been going on and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office the cop goes outside to confront him what does the police officer do knowing that something is seriously wrong he goes up and calmly talks to the killer who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killers lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him overthe cop quickly starts telling nicole that hes a goner whos lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesnt die for quite a while the two of them do some more pointless talking and the allimportant fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time when the two of them finally try to use the gun nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize him she fires one into his mouth and he lays still for a few moments with a chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shocknicole finally confronts the killerand fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop in the bathroom building she hears nicole crying for help in the closet locked in like tracy was she gets a policeman to go inside and check it but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet the cop leaves thinking hes been tricked a battered nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all of 10 seconds looking apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there wowthis movie is apparently the first in a new line of quality directtodvd movies marketed as being too extreme for theaters in reality its just more clich bmovie garbage

0,"im not a regular viewer of springers but i do watch his show in glimpses and i think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time so naturally im going to watch this movie expecting to see jerry springer uncensored first of all jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the films running time the other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudofarce about trailertrash jealousy incest and deception jaime pressley who looks hot as hellll is a trailertrash slut who sleeps with her stepfather a very unusuallooking chainsmoking drunken michael dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona the mom finds out about the affair they get into a fight they want to take it to the jerry show thats right no springer and then we have a parallel story with an africanamerican couple they take it to the jerry show the characters collide blah blah freakin blah trash has rarely been this borrringg i was wondering why the hell springer has millions of fans yet none of them checked out his movie well now its totally obvious whether you love him or hate him you will hate this movie how can i explain its a total mess of a motion picture if thats what you call it its so badly edited with scenes that just dont connect and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and its simply all over the map just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce with seldom laughs my only positive note is a hot girlgirl scene thats as risque as it gets dont get me wrong the scenes pretty risque but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on springers programthis disastrous farce seems extremely sanitizedmy score 3 out of 10

0,"mel welles you might remember him as mr mushnick in roger cormans little shop of horrors directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of dr frankensteins daughter carrying on her fathers work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to bedo good but rather for its sex appeal you see tania frankenstein though a doctor and scientist in her own right is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love the story is tissuethin here and one gets what one might expect lots of leering and suggestive commentssurprisingly most from the female lead special effects that are not so special acting that lacks depth of characterization and not really much action or suspense and while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling lady frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable  not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless italian actress rosalba neri aka sara baybey plays the barons daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal she oozes desire and seduction quite well her performance is pretty onedimensional but she is quite lovely and plays overthetop a little too well she is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift poor joseph cotten now regulated to european horror films for money plays the father in a brief yet competent performance he is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear as for the rest of the cast paul muller is somewhat effective as dr charles marshall the barons assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village policemani wasnt buying thismickey hargitay starts to pump tania for answers  despite what you might think not to her satisfaction where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script weak performances and lackluster direction all head further south the creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the 1970s while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones

0,"the film moves quite well, but the direction of interpretation and editing leave a lot to be desired the characters are mostly raised from other films and the vinnie Jones lookalike is straight away in 50 seconds the movie of comedy gangster is a genre that should have a lot of contrasts the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shooting that leaves everyone dead you should never really know whether or just sit there in shock this movie had the right elements but it's too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut to the little details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once the belief was a little more unsuspected a fair become critical because it was a brave attempt and although clint Eastwood is famous to say that it will be ok for a scene he puts the work before he turns and he's clinched Eastwood here a little more imagination with the camera and and and a little more coaching and repetition for the delivery of the lines would have made a great difference"

film unless you count 10 seconds of shelling by a halfdozen reenactors and one collapsed shed the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean beaudins reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors what you do get for your money is a simple but drawnout harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that fabio doesnt turn up in the cast its the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfallan anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so much unite oncewarring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew this massive boxoffice disaster was clearly intended to be canadas titanic  though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film not the ship  but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror described it as so bad that one cant even find the strength to mock it thats rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film looks like a belowpar 80s miniseries the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring youll never see your handsome lover again cuckolds honor youll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of murder and  gasp  witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moores version of the scarlet letter throw in caddish british governors devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and youve got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still managed to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds albeit without the staggering technical incompetenceleading man david la hayes versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look flirts with the cleanshaven tchky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages while his opening scene where he reacts to news of his fathers death with an expression that looks like hes waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor whos lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie piper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading lady doesnt exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying centerstage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot that really is the characters name the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky greyhaired wig its a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like hes not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he clearly couldnt be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the films brief releasesome brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnettarchie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roths william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one whos being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like colm meaneys benjamin franklin theyre both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroines real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better

0,"I agree in many parts with the rather in-depth review already posted on the subject of miniseries and agree that it has its advantages not only its disadvantages for example the original film manages to truncate a large part of the medium and final sections of the novel into one montage, including the discovery of a murine and the affair of love of paul atreides and chani which, at the reading of the novel, was probably born from the workshop cutting shenanigen whose other examiner writes that it was one of the great defects of the original film and the miniseries to his credit do not understand many of the original plot lines that were cut off from the film lynch because of the expansive nature of the novel herbert while this in itself is a double-edged sword rather than completing a textocelluloid transfer of the novel than the creators of the miniseries have not yet reached the vision of death, whereas the authors of the story have not yet come to the head of death."
0,"i agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries and agree that it does have its pros not only its cons for example the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and chani which on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes this was one of the great failings of the original film and the miniseries to its credit does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature of the herbert novelhowever this in itself is a double edged sword rather than complete a texttocelluloid transfer of the novel the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines absent from the original novel similarly although this is surely a fuller account of the storyline of dune it is also a break from the originals heart and soul  main vision  that of prophecy where are the internal monologues that characterize herberts writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so much of the original agony of pauls decision to choose the jihad or death the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself and one which captivates people who are far from science fiction fans is missing without prophecy what is the point of dune it is simply a more educated and learned version of farscape or andromeda how sad that this is all we are provided with lynchs film was flawed yes but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another filmmaker taking on some of the best points of lynchs filmmaking and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline now this story shall probably never be translated to film again and this i find heartrending

0,a spoiler a loner has some wonderful moments to recommend him when charlotte and veronica get closer to intimacy is a beautiful bass key really erotic scene I also liked the musical score and the soft mute cinematography does not know whether the curious stop and the starting structure of the film are originally digested in serialized the advertiser describing the action in the sections is rather boring my biggest problem with this film is his rather absurd representation of a transwomen and his life of course it must be shown as a sexworker what impractically scatter a completely desperate barrillingie when it comes to dressing and incapable of making interpersonal attachments in the world besides she has always shown with two days of growth of the beard for a strange reason as if highlighting how her life is and she waits to get the genre reassignment woman could not find the idea of a man as she apparently did nothing else to make her transition the character is not someone in the transition who really is a person in the transition who is more typical of a person who is a person in the transition those fantasies's most typical person who is not a person in the transition

0,"This is a film that doesn't focus on writing his biography by the author al stump now it's not such a horrible idea in theory that the cobb itself has slipped even more into the paranoid dementia advanced years and the stories of his excrement trodden even as an elder are shocking even by the desensitized norms of today but instead of focusing on these events that I simply imagine to be too interesting the film is a pseudo-fidelized road movie with a cliché plot that will make any fan of cobbs cry the tears of vinegar and I don't even know how he played the role of a cobb conchety, but somehow he manages to surprise his formwork talent most of the stories of cobbs are barely credible, but to make him even mad, it seems both impossible and useless to try the scene of his baseball work as a contchety is not even easy to see the contay if it's a question of whether it's not a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question or not a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question or not a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question or not a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question of whether it's a question or not a question or not a question or not a question of a question of a question of whether it'."
0,"ty cobb is by far the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty so of course the film about him deals with none of that instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al stump now this isnt such a horrible idea in theory as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by todays desensitized standards but instead of focusing on these events which i guess was simply too interesting the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichd a clichd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy most stories about cobb are barely believable but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary robert wuhl portraying the writer al stump is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent he sucks the life out of every scene trying to make this film his own nagasaki there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore arliss doesnt count its barely a show even the played out inevitable role reversal of cobb and stump by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that dont sound like a poor book on tape narration voice for all the awful writing and bland filmmaking on display there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting its from the same film is near impossible a hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying cobbs overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance the camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster cobb every slide hit and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the master player it makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same actor its worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone just to see what could have been i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting it to be something it isnt but to make such boring neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical im glad ron sheltons career has slid ever since

0,"i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film look at it a month later and you might see it differently or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival aided by the films director and producer gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches ma film directors this was not an overly ishocking film there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious filmmaking on the promise of a controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived overemphasised and sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and the figleaf reference marquis de sade as one audience member put it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finalewe have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence when pushed robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside himthe film is not entirely without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way was it the influence of his peers why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life cinematically there is a carefullymontaged scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs shyness a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat a dj is more concerned that the girls screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way robert slumps with his back to us in the foregroundbut the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention if they vomit we have succeeded in producing a reaction but mostly  and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes  they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality filmmaking director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet even his defence that there is little plot development because he didnt want to do a standard hollywood movie  all are good answers to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths one aspect of art is to educate another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workandy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his ability at the moment only extends to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film

0,"when in rome is a definite improvement on getting there getting there i found too predictable contrived and slow and to this day i still consider it as the olsen twins worst however while when in rome isnt a terrible movie its not a great one either if i had to sum it up in one word i would say passable it is good fun for teenagers but i think adults wont find much to go onwhen in rome does have its good points mary kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent actresses certainly very pretty as well i will admit when i was 10 or so i really liked them and in general i kind of like them still and i have enjoyed some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute back on target both girls dont do that bad a job in fact they are very appealing plus their outfits are to die for and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking the soundtrack aint half bad eitherhowever where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script the script is on the most part clichd and has hints of deja vu the plot like most of the mary kate and ashley movies is very predictable and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen twins work will find some rather unoriginal elements to it most of the characters are cardboard thin and you dont learn very much about them and sometimes the pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work that looked rushed constantlyall in all does have its good points and certainly watchable however for my taste it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff 410 bethany cox

0,"at least if youre a disney fanatic well of the variety who loves their liveaction films as well as the animated stuff if youre a kid if youre a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize youre an adult if you love absolutely any film that features animals especially when theyre doing tricks or if youre just not too demanding air bud world pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch im a disney fanatic i enjoyed this film enough and ill gladly watch it againbut boy does it have a lot of problems the main flaw arises from a combination of too many characters too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all in the space of 82 minutes weve got adults getting married teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it teen competition for love and jealousy preteens playing spy games dogs falling in love dogs playing soccer dogs having puppies manipulative parents wholl do anything to make their kids win being taught a lesson by their kids housekeeper dilemmas and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots im probably forgetting something but thats 10 big plot issues to be dealt with with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them and presumably weave them into a coherent whole thats both not too complicatedthis is a kids film after alland thats also humorous and heartwarming not surprisingly director bill bannerman on his first turn being completely in charge he has a lot of previous second unit experience wasnt quite up to the task im sure it didnt help that there were at least three screenwriters involved and probably dictating producers as wellthe end result is that air bud world pup is extremely choppy events occur with little justification and worse often little explanation people figure out and do things primarily because they need toand fastso that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than 90 minutes from one cut to the next time might jump ahead six months or so we have both adults who seem like maybe theyre mentally disabled and kids who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action some of the threads should have simply been removed because its difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as youre introduced to an idea its already passed you byalso not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a ripoff of one hundred and one dalmatians 1961 minus a cruella de vil character and another problem is that given the way the film is edited i have to assume that the dog air bud probably couldnt do much with the soccer ball unlike the first two films a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here and when we see him its in very quick glimpses every once in a while these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animationyet for someone like me theres a cheesy charm to air bud world pup the script and performances often teeter between ridiculous hokey and kinda clichd i tend to like that combination it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre and at times like the ending when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the us womens soccer team air bud world pup is so blatantly tacky that you cant help but love it

0,"what a great word reimagining is isnt that what they call dawn of the dead mmiv 2004 a clever word indeed  it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate remake that is and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well damn was i misled at least i was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of reimagining though it played a rolestill why make a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern audience or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions boils down to one thing stealing someones idea and reshaping it or reimagining it so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it its like colescliffs notes dump everything in a blender purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors in other words a great marketing schemeso whats wrong with this one well ill start with what i liked i liked the opening scenes thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means we see the city in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and death two words that look beautiful on screen then it all falls apartthis setup leads nowhere the movie does what almost every remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story its noisier in some sense bloodier and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the setting the mall which played a crucial role in the original films story and theme is purely coincidental the idea communicated in romeros film the pure ecstatic joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is gone here further this reimagining has no moxie no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span and doesnt bother to get us interested in the characters or the story the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original you actually grew to care about those people in romeros version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here you dont care when or who goes what matters is how they gowhat else is their to say the film is not scary it has one or two jump scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects as a story its really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is also reduced to a few oneliners and one really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for one thing it kicked the passion of christ from its number one spot in the box office well done zombies

0,it was supposed to be a comedy or a serious drama this film starts with a light joke between three fine women it moves in a conflict between women when one of them meets a fine man there are some ancients between them well but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I wondered if I had misinterpreted the first part of the film it continues in this vein for a while until at the end it tries to return to the original light joke but now it's too late it's hard to see why these women would continue to talk to each other and the final is really unconvincing for British filmmakers anyway how not to make films difficult to see how the producers would convince themselves that this film would work and the box office turned out to be a real flop because id never heard of this film until this weekend four years after its release

0,"i wish more movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long gone with the wind gettysburg  thats about the length ive come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of itby contrast ang lees film is bloated and uneventful it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours that wasnt a compliment its really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at allthe film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe the central two are jake the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln and jack an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares i had to reread that sentence to make sure i hadnt written jack instead of jake at some point or vice versa the two go off to become bushwhackers  southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they cant even be bothered to join the official southern army which i presume they think is for sissies im afraid lee lost me right there its easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as if we know them in some way then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more not so here we arent properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes clear hes a gormless pimple of a man who isnt a confederate by choice so much as by habit  the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely immitative the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen i thought good  kill the rebels end the damned war let me go homeaggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent ive heard accents from all over the englishspeaking world and this is the worst of them all i dont care if southerners really did talk like that its simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours lees picture is a talky one largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical sayeverythingthreetimes folksy drawl it would help if they talked faster but not much cant these people find a more efficient language in which to communicatein short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech who dont bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war good points jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel we were teased with her body but never actually allowed to gaze upon it which i think is the least we were owed

0,"okayso ive seen a lot of really oddunusual movies in my day fear and loathing in las vegas comes to mind when i think of that well not anymorefrom here on out whenever someone asks me hey whats the most unusual movie youve ever seen slipstream is what ill say and i do not mean unusual in a good wayfrom the very beginning of the movie it was obvious that this was going to be one of those trippy camera effect movies by that i mean little things like flashing images on the screen rewinding and fastforwarding peoples words and scenes messing with the color on the screen flash forwards and flash backs constantlythen you have the actual acting itself people randomly get violent shoot thingspeople say the weirdest things that just dont make much if any sensethe movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book hes writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it you basically see this trip he goes on throughout the movie the thing is johnny depp went on a similar trip in fear and loathing in las vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch not painful honestly i had a real hard time even finishing slipstream it kind of hurt my brain a biti can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementiablah blah blah point is this movie hurts your brain when you watch itit makes very little sense it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end the only thing you can be happy about is that its overand you can say you actually sat through it so in closing if you want to see a movie that will have you saying what the heck over and over again both out loud and in your head go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this outmr hopkins while i applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directingplease do not ever make a movie like this again next time try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache

0,I thought I was going to watch a scary movie and I ended up laughing throughout the movie in the scene where the human turned into a werewolf I thought they were joking today computer games have ten times better low-budget animations is an appropriate comment I would recommend wolf 1994 with Jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie it has good special effects because they should be human turning into a werewolf unless you wanted to have a good laugh I wouldn't recommend you watching this movie this movie is a joke

0,"the other is a movie of supposed horror made during the 1970s one should not be confused with the similar title the others who played nicole kidman the plot is as follows a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her binocular grandsons something simply called as the game one of these twin boys is supposed to be good the other a holland is supposed to be bad the idea is quite interesting as an abstract concept and the film was adapted from a novel I can't hope that the novel was interesting because the film was incredibly boring from the beginning to the end the performance of this film is a lot like a television film of the genre uk residents could see on channel 5 actually this film looks like a day film for this television channel a slight cut to one or two scenes and it would be a urated film of the kind of production of a night film, but even the youngest of children could really see this movie bored instead of being afraid of the other film that I don't need to see a horror film is his fort on the characters of the story that he really knows about the characters of the story"
0,"the other is a supposed horror movie made during the 1970s it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the others which starred nicole kidmanthe plot is as follows  a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as the game one of these twin boys  niles  is supposed to be good the other one  holland  is supposed to be evilthe idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to endthe execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel 5 in fact this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel a slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a urated movie of the kind disney produce but even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by the otheryou dont need to check out the directors cv to realise horror is not his fortemr mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story this is obvious from the getgo i havent seen any of his other movies but to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site unfortunately in the other the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expectthe direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single scene takes place in the daytime think about this  a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric believe me it isnt it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a horror movie and yes both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in californiathere is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointlessthe ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period i wont reveal which movie but ill give 2 clues  a young boy was a main character and the movie is wellknown and ill add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter moviethe acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded 2 stars the actors playing the twin boys along with the actress playing the grandmother all try hard with the poor material they are givendiana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cashin on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewersi paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover of the region 2 version in the uk comparisons were made to the exorcist which i thought was a complete insult to that movie there is no comparison the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not  suspense tension tongueincheek humour highly disturbing content great acting superb characterisation and viewer involvement ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the 1950s let alone the 1970sthe 1970s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist the omen the texas chainsaw massacre the legend of hell house salems lot to name just a few being produced for this reason the other proves an even greater disappointmentif anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about i would advice everyone to skip the movie

0,The best thing about the movie is the name because it describes both the plot and the act at least they can't say that they didn't warn you as the button labeled not push cesegal must have exhausted things that move like aircraft trains and boats but the plot remains the same undercover guy who fights slowly but always beats like 40 types mercenaries and doesn't blink even when doing what amazes me that Segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still can't hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and 50 clips of calmo where all these balls actually go to the only buy-in function of this movie is watching nia peeples pound ja rule true name Jeffrey atkins doesn't sound just as punk in the ground I could spend days watching this woman foot on her shoulder like that especially wearing an outfit as it was just a bonus watching jeffy get ss ss and having fun one of those kicks that just the time we could get hard man can't act like something rapper on the movie that's not an easy thing that's just about the movie

0,Jack brooks quirks are at first somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy sensation of the beginning of this filmi found himself angry and angry that I was fooled to see this one until the end in the hope that the payment would be the value of the super-tempered wait the climax cannot begin to compensate for all the time of configurationnormally one could expect some shallow characters of this kind but the fact that the waiting time before the index action is so high should mean that the meantime would be devoted to a development of interesting character not so while not without its original charms this film finally fury and disappoint that I could get all that time of configuration again to reinvest it in something that pays

0,I was a huge fan of the original team of the company since I was eight years old I watched all the films and appreciated each one for what they kept from the old series and to develop further the characters and the trek star universe in general even in the unknown country I thought that the aging of the characters was well managed and the story worthy of a theatrical release however having said that the star trek v the final border is easily the worst of the series staging the original crew I agree with a lot that the camaraderie of kirk spock and mccoy is well managed but the overall scenario the direction of william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than an episode of television is a movie of boyfriend shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout shout sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut shout shout shout sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut sut

0,"For me this film is essentially like a long pilot episode of a TV series it reminds me particularly the British remake of the television series wallander starring kenneth branagh the people interviewed by the police are bold and often as bitter as the time the main investigator has huge family investigations invariably led to crueltys of the distant past and the plot is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and sub-plots making sense only at the end have an excellent cinematography the plot of the pot city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or we crime series actually you can take the plots of one of the episodes to touch gel and graft them on the top of the local spot in this film and have an effective sequel the script could no longer be of the cup to biscuit that you have called the more familiar patterns as the police go to prison in a unique way people found themselves in the world of telemanipulation and dangerous explode at the end of the interviewim absolutely convinced that it is the scones and the jam for many subjects that I have needed to find a lot of genetics, but I think that I have to find a lot of folk"

0,dear reader watching this film is not really a film although its creators have the impertinence to call it so if you have not been warned of its content here it goes the film is simply a sequence of imaginations that flow continuously and try to convey a certain concept of feeling that they could therefore be called symbols the images are accompanied by a sound sound sound band its objective being to create the atmosphere as well as the images that the director has chosen cannot transmit feelings to an American audience because they are in an overwhelming number of American icons although the film is intended to express the idea of civilized war it does not only do so because of the general chaos but also because it is far too long and weary and I have felt strongly that many scenes do not have to do with the war in which conception to conclude that I was greatly disappointed by a documentary that is not a film that is not something that is not the only strong point of which is the extraordinary use of technology in the processing of images

0,"spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequelmakers think that they have to explain and therefore destroy the mysteries behind iconic horror films the original hellraiser of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made the 1988 sequel hellbound was also a fantastic horror film though i personally didnt like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites some of the alltime creepiest horrorvillains in the original the third part hell on earth 1992 was already quite a mess whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy leadcenobite pinhead a typical 90s stupidity and therefore destroyed most of his scariness this fourth part hellraiser bloodline 1996 is slightly more atmospheric than the third one but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary background information about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hellseriously  did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made i think not and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film the setting of bloodline goes back and forth in three different periods the film begins in a 22nd century spacestation when scientist dr merchant bruce ramsay attempts to close the gates to hell forever when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons in 18th century paris merchants ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an evoked demon the princess of hell took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina vargas since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages the film which takes place in the 18th century the present and the 22nd century really is quite a mess i admit that the part set in the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements the films undoubtedly strong points are the terrific makeup and goreeffects the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the shedemon and pinhead doug bradley who in spite of having lost some of his creepiness still is a menacing villain it is an almost offensive idea for hellraiser fans however that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous lightshow overall bloodline is not a complete disaster but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee overall this is only recommendable to hardcore pinheadfanatics and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demons creepiness all others are welladvised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second part of the hellraiser franchise and skip all the others the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy as hell but almost everything else is disappointing my rating 3510

of days gets the terminator out of his openbacked hospital gown arnold schwarzeneggers return to the big screen after his heart operation whilst blowing things up in mysterious ways and blaspheming biblical verse to give catholics something more to whine aboutit is 1999 and doomsayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn even as the technological stank of y2k muttons the new york streets excop turned alcoholic security guard jericho cane schwarzenegger with the perfunctory deadwifeandkid backstory for loose cannon effect must brave theological waters to save 20yearold virgin christine robin tunney from being conscripted as  wait for it  the bride of satan dun dah daaaarrrh stupidity ensuesfor every antihero there is his antichrist gabriel byrne is the devil here  and hes out to party like its 1999 on a mission to impregnate christine with the antichrist between 11 pm and 12 midnight december 31 1999  ironically in the hour that all porn will be lost  thereby bringing about the end of days being able to read minds conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic it doesnt occur to satan to expedite the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time instead he appears on december 28th like a keyser soze terminator and wonders why she doesnt welcome him with open thighs see above comment re stupidity here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology a priest rod steiger tells jericho that 666 is really 999 upside down with a 1 in front of it so wait  prince is the antichristsatan soze pursues jericho and christine j and c  get it around town at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture in one scene satan recreates jerichos wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid christine but if he can see so deeply into jerichos mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia why cant he see where jericho hid christine not ten minutes ago satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue yet he cant make that assassin unjam a semiautomatic weapon and when jericho shoots satan at point blank range satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing so jericho wont worry unduly about satans health  not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds matter of fact instead of simply possessing jericho himself to get close to christine and rape her satan expends so much unnecessary energy on sideprojects crucifying the tongueless guy blowing up jerichos partner kevin pollak and then saving him and then blowing him up again ridiculously battling jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought that we wonder whether a more efficient assassinlover shouldnt be put on the case  say antonio banderaswhat i find most precious about end of days is arnolds valiant attempts at the method sad means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent depressed means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent deathly scared means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent theres definitely a pattern here if we could only decipher itin the end the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these but from the atheist jericho while the timid men of an impotent god exhort faith and quiver in their cells doing nothing about satan actually walking amongst them the prince of darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent which clearly says something that catholics blindly refuse to hear that even if the devil were to exist those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall let alone act towards it further they might not truly want him defeated for only through his contrary polarity does their gods existence become tenablefor it is written in the book of revelations and the prince of darkness shall descendeth upon the earth without any solid game plan and impregnate a virgin on a date which wont have any significance until the gregorian calendar of the 1500s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the anno domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia by which time christians will have forgotten christs actual birth date and appropriated the pagan saturnalia festival in its stead and the prince shall effect a revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguouslylesbian band members i can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified and the alcoholic built like a mr universe i can believe that a giant supernatural monster cant kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent i can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century celtic druid ritual as foreplay  but what i cannot believe is the 20yearold virgin in new york city in 1999especially around prince

0,I have to say that I have been unmasked with this movie I have never been such a big bnl fans I find their songs childish genre and obsessively nostalgic it's me in 9th year if I had a million dollars life shoe box etc. However I have seen clips from their live show and I really like the improvisation and fantasistic nature of the show I hoped that this film would highlight what is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played but somehow or another bland and not that there is a bass solo standup in the middle that was completely useless and boring while Jim Creegan creates himself the film does not do it and shows only a few minutes and you know that they had better moments than in the afganistan concert koffee anan hes man own the man own the many stve paige and im really bnl be over the place of i gounge a few years ago or heard this song blullai some 99 times ago and I heard that song by this song
0,"i must say that i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl fans i find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade 9 if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know theyve had better moments as in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan hes the man in charge my names steve paige and im really large bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull blue song by effeil 99 or whatever every 2 minutes i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is like that years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play if i had a million dollars bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull then all of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah theyre brand new but theyre all in their 30s while the rest of canada is going oh geez i thought those guys folded years ago do i have to listen to million dollars againthe concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think theyre all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it the interviews with moses znaimer a canadian media mogule and terry david mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionallythis movie doesnt really document very much either i mean its basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage its not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the end its rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either

1,"After seeing this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie im not to say that it belongs in the top 250 of all time, but in its genre it's a great movie I know that few people find fun to see how a legendary story like the tournament hood is transformed into a comedy many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with them are wrong mel brooks did an excellent job with the men of tournament hood in tights I saw the original tournament hood movies as well but I never had such a good time watching them as I had with this one just a continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and the movies winton Churchil the goldfatori recommend to all those who want to have a good laugh to watch this movie to those who think that the tournament hood shouldn't be spoiled with you, but you better not watch it because you'll probably be offended by it I give this movie an 810"

1,"I admit that during the first 20 minutes of this film that I was not quite sure that I was going to sit through everything like many other people I found it rather boring and I didn't quite look forward to an hour and a half to see this guy biting circles and sticking them together but if you sit down through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you have an idea how impressive the rest of the film is I really think it's sad that so many people found this boring impossible or a retreading of ideas made by other artists rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the work and gold methods that makes his art entirely out of things in nature you have an idea how impressive the rest of the film is usually produced in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy it's slow and defamizing how he always wanted to see his film, but I think that only one single single part of the person who doesn't think that only one only one only one resulting in art that only only wants to think that only one person does not think that he does not think that he does not think that he does not want to see that he does not believe that he does not believe that he does not want to know that he does not want to know that he does not to know that he does not."
1,"i admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film i wasnt entirely sure i was going to sit through the whole thing like many other people i found it pretty boring and i wasnt entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together however if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is i really think its sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy it is slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that goldsworthys art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated ive even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which i just think is madnesson the other hand lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics i guess im just the kind of person that believes that id like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie he does after all lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you dont want goldsworthy talk about his art while youre watching the film feel free to turn the sound off thats like not reading the lyrics if you dont want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourselfi think that andy goldsworthys work which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and im glad that this film was made in order to showcase it indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented goldsworthys work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is not the star goldsworthys art is and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the film it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that

1,There is not a lot of intrigue in this movie there is a rich owner of the baseball team who dies and whose woman will continue the hospital for neglect not much more than that but it doesn't matter because you have some real actors giving their life of dialogue and because of the casting you yourself have some hysterical scenes and even if you don't crack laugh you have a smile on your face mattau plays charley whose woman recently died and who finds herself the object of the desire of several women at the hospital he is delighted to taste everything on the menu that is available to him so he meets ann atkinson glenda jackson who is first a patient in the hospital their first scene together is very funny and then they find themselves on a panel discussion where they don't agree on almost every subject that is discussed charley starts at as ann and viceversa doesn't play much of life it's not very great on the monogamous in the men in his life her husband was a woman who doesn't want to give her a chance and they don't even decide to give her a woman a lot of loyalty that woman who doesn't want to give her a chance and they don't have a lot more than a woman who doesn't decide to give her a chance

1,the only imaginable defect of this film is its title please stop comparing it to the first one that I did in my previous review only to separate it from the first one if you have not seen the film and are curious totally forget the first one and invent a different name for that there is nothing similar and has a mood quite its own this is a great exponent of viscous comedy of the mid-1980s I seriously doubt that such great names in this distribution made the film because they were broken or even wanted to redo the first one who ever wanted to kick the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason it is in the bottom of the Imdb 100 is because of its title I usually hate movies like these Adam Sandler ie goes farrell farrellly bros but this film just keeps me laughing hysterically i dunno perhaps sound like a bad relationship I can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either as it is the only film most underestimated of the 80's that we love manro2003

1,These first two seasons of this comic series were very strange and they weren't very funny and had a dramatic element where Bill the mother struggled with all the usual problems in life but this element was a bit depressing and didn't mix well with the elements of the comedy which is probably why it was abandoned after it soon became one of the funniest series of comedies that bbc ever made chemistry between the bill and ben characters were very funny and there were always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series the Christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas the show came to a stop when lead actor Gary olsen playing the bill that was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in movies like n under and a very funny man tearing up this underrated show sadly disappeared from our television screens and didn't have to be repeated that often although he appeared on the gold uktv once in a time but he should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience

1,"i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett ohara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell  but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayedone can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in 49th parallel but they are nazis who consider him  a liberal westerner canadian  fair game to double cross in wartime it isnt the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful  or try to be soulful witness his poet  dreamer  wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maughams of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter  but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedphilip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny  the latter a friend of howards although howards performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here  it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to 1934 like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouselike secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchcuriously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby  she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in 1934 leading to the largest write  in campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she costarred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest

1,"When I saw the movie announced for the first time, I thought it was going to be another disney movie that goes almost directly to the video, I ended up moving and renting it I thought it was going to be bad because I couldn't see Shia in any other role than her show recently cancelled even Stevens when I lit it I was ready to turn it off in about ten minutes it started a little slowly and I couldn't understand the beginning because the years don't make sense then they explained that later in the show so I was relieved to ask myself about all this and all I thought it was a good movie and I would recommend that the casting was top and even if im not a golf fan he easily kept my attention with a good plot"

1,If you're looking for a typical war movie it's not a note for all the cannons testosteroneamped carnagecraving war buffs out there don't bother well that the film is on Russian characters in wwii doesn't expect to see any Nazi cannons blood gore etc. it's not a movie about people who cause a war or fight a war it's a movie about ordinary people that war arrives at and the choices they make by dealing with itacting cinematography writing all the perfect 10s here you'll certainly appreciate if you're Russian like me but even if you probably don't like it if you don't speak Russian watch the ruscico cinema board dvd version its obtained subtitles in about 14 different languages but the English doubling on this one id say is just as good as the original Russian track some stuff is lost in the translation but just as good as the English subtitles then go check it out especially if you're studying the movie in any aspect

1,"the reason I said that it was because I wrote the script and I knew very little about it being done until I was asked to see the film that I wrote it for some producers who sold it without telling me because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine I learned about it that I had only written a first draft, so I was obviously worried when I heard that it was on the ground that I asked Peter Collinson through my agent if he could like me to do another draft I also asked if I could see my original script because I had lost I had been said too late so I did the only thing that I could do in the circumstances and I took my name off I had no idea what they could have done to my script so I was invited to see the movie finished I was so impressed that I very quickly asked my name again on a play beautifully made of a script I would not have liked to see again if I did not want to do so much on my original script I would have liked to do so much more about it"

1,It's a great film to watch since it's so nicely directed by andrzej wajda but at the same time I would have liked the film to have a little more depth in terms of its history it's a film that's historically relevant on the last days of the French revolution but yet the film forgets to focus on the motivations of the characters making the film a little too superficial to consider this brilliant and relevant film to which it doesn't make the film smaller to watch although it has done with passion and eye for detail all aspects of the film is good to look like its decorating costumes and cameraworks also the story still works as powerful even if at the same time it could have been so much better and more powerful with a little more development of character and insightful historical information if you're completely familiar with the French revolution and the stories of Danton and Dresses in particular this film could be a little more beautiful to see you a little more typical of a French film to tell slowly and subtly without ever working too much in detail this film could be a bit bigger than a little more clear than a film than a little more clear film.

1,"It would be imprudent to judge the narrative or documentary history to be more authentic than the other formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of the reality that producers seek to reconstruct and tell stories in their perspectives, because the two formats usually leave some questions without discussion because of the complexity of the subplots and the screen time that they deny viewers the opportunity to open debates and to construct real truth adding to viewers the inability to evaluate sources, for example the written history and the logic behind the arguments the history can be opened to distortion by the narrative and the documentary to most people the documentary can be seen more truthful because it usually involves testimonies of real participants and real sequences, but these visuals of history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history"

1,"this is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account lets filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an independent lowbudget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one this film is an almost 100 accurate dramatization of dahmers adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isnt a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer 2001 was the movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmers psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isnt anyones fault but dahmers that 17 people died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain you do see two deaths that i remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid while you dont see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesnt look to be exploitive besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmers death in 1994 due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior thats about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as ive stated very true to the facts the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of americas most remembered serial killers i think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer

1,"This is a little more than the team of transformers that passed on the mega foxes. Fortunately, there is a small robotic jewel known to be the movie that broke down the charles and the bands of Albert empire images studio seems to have developed a following cult over the years I like to watch it on vhs during its first video release in the early 90s and although some of the cold warra politicians were already out of date at that time just the bands chance that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be published while it was still a bit cool bmovie they really don't do that or if they were going to the end of its way and it's things unforgivable for each of the robots that the roboscoop was somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust the wars on a large scale that were overtaken between the nations"

1,It's the kind of film that if it was made today it would probably be star Sandra bulbock and câlinh grant in fact now that I think about it this one is quite likely to be remake one day its pleasant but without any depth that it suffers from the almost fatal error of spreading james stewart in a role it is about 20 years too old for and therefore there is no chemistry between it and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small role of support of an aspiring author is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call spirit 12

1,"this is the moving tale of scotlands legendary hero rob roy and his battles with the feudal landowners like braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical despite their primarily fictional nature i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two the 13 century william wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early 18th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsmanthe story revolves around a clan chieftain robert roy mcgregor who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two young sons as the movie begins he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lords cattle rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble the marquis of montrose in order to buy cattle to herd to market he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend alan mcdonald when both mcdonald and the money turn up missing rob roy finds himself in conflict with montrose as well as his despicable protg archibald cunningham and his sleazy factor killearn rob roys honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival the duke of argyle whom he wishes to accuse of being a jacobitethe charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy an intelligent virile and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale personally i feel that this is neesons best performance his brogue albeit irish adding authenticity for the average viewer rob roy is a stubborn proud courageous and honest man whose word can be trusted he is a loving husband  father and also touchingly loyal to his friend mcdonald who is accused of robbing him tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains archibald cunningham an egotistical ruthless strutting peacock he is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women whether willing or otherwise the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own fathers identity though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder rape and thievery also he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl betty after she becomes pregnant with his child resulting in her suicide john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose who is eventually implied to be cunninghams fatherthe movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife i think the phrase used by this pair how fine you are to me is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as robs wife mary mcgregor lacking make up she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham while the disgusting killearn looks on her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as marys pain and humiliation but nothing intended to sensationalize their kinsman alastair mcgregor shows emotional anguish when he learns of marys rape and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale

1,I've seen a director take so much flack for her style before now it's obvious that most people don't like tony scotts hoppy flashy editing technique if I have to choose between loving her and hating her id saying I love it was distracted limit sometimes but the result was pretty good and her result of seeing a director with a creative edge to her style and some originality even though she borrows a lot of videos mtv this stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of mean bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely tranquilizing otherwise she plays her way wrong because I have hated her character a lot and does not sympathize a little with her production without counting how much she suffered domino through her life that she joins with other mickey roke hunters way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way

1,"So, forgive the really lame gameplay scene cardboard background and studio as stage for this part I should have given the movie 5 instead of 7 but read from the premise to the plot there are many similarities with the replacements some say that this film rips off the replacements while some say that this script written before it both films requires a kind of suspension of the unbelief on the basic premise and this is particularly difficult for the second string because it has nfl the licensing team and the whole story behind it food excuse poison may seem too lame for some people and not mention in the second chain bills must overcome great scores and again with the budget limit in the shooting of the game scene this do even bad in the replacements of the premise and the league is fictional but you know that this happens in real life I think it's easier to accept the fiction story and play with the actual event oh yes it doesn't really happen with the game scenario and the other time it's not possible to change the two movies in the day that the two movies come to the other day that the team doesn't come to change the time that the two movies are not possible"

1,the quality of animation here is decidedly below by imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself is sensible but the characters whose this might seem difficult but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel at ease there as a machine never emulate the human arrogance shortsightedness and greed so effectively I doubt that there are some pointers towards it in the film but only when the team can be bored to put them by and big bioroids or whatever they are interchangeable with the human characters seems to sloppy for me the main characters seem to have some kind of emotional angle even if no light is put on this small lighting is poured on the background at all a great pity the short length of the film coupled with the accent on mecha and crime means that we do not see any depth of character the basics all down have not yet been left with a finished product a version of this oav not so much as to have made a great episode of this movie not so much as to have made a short one.

1,"I can't really condemn the film because there are enough elements of black film to consider it as a black film, but I think it's only in the category there's nothing sinister in this room and where the black elements are not sure that the disease could be considered a sinister one, but I'm having trouble seeing that the film suggests a darker blackie than the human trafficking the new Orleans police is only too willing to arrest a journalist the spectre of the plague hangs on all the people of the film, but it's really only hints that there's no attempt to question the motives of the reeds as we do with marlowe or spade, and there's no attempt to bring a human side to blackie that would make it even more despicable if the human trafficking was actually played that the lack of depth is what fails at the end the story is decent the act is good writing and direction are well done but there's nothing more worth doing here than doing a film if you don't have to remember it again if you don't even remember it again if you really need to look back here"

1,ok maybe it doesn't deserve an Oscar or a golden globe or any price for this material the act is not remarkable there is no reason to give credits to the staging and its really just another semigory slasher 21st century flick that most people will just consider decent or maybe even terrible but in my opinion all this doesn't matter a bit and that's because I had a great time to watch this film the first 40 minutes are quite slow but as the film progresses something in what you will love if you are like I was and anyone else should be when you watch this film and who is looking for 2 hours of fun violence and a kickass that ends up that I don't spoil yes there are many defects in this film but doesn't leave the casting list on the front cover crazy you Hilton delivers a decent performance that no one has seen even his greatest haters like me and my friends have had to accept that she didn't surprise us and they didn't bother to say that she didn't surprise us with her skills and they didn't bother me.

1,oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time the best word to describe it is genius the writing of the act the lines of the story all about this show is absolutely incredible I just discovered the show and I became addicted to it right away and I was really surprised that it got the recognition that it really deserves it is violent and most of the characters are destined for you to love them but the show is written in such a brilliant way that allows you to look beyond the violence and the criminals and see them as real people they are the lowest forms of garbage but it always finds a way to allow you to understand many characters and even to care about their stories the violence in the show is necessary for it to be as realistic as possible but the show is on violence as some might believe it is really a work of art and im sure that gives it a chance will love it as much as I do it.

1,"finally third time lucky this film has been always been on my mind but my first viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film then only a couple months later i had the my second chance of watching of it so i decided i would record it only to discover that my timer went off late and again i missed the first half of the flick i wasnt going to allow that to happen again so when it came on tv again i thought bugger it ill wait until it comes on then i will record it and it was a good choice i would have just watched the film but they always put on weeknights around midnight after discovering a hole in their crowded cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the counterfeit king said he had hidden they think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled although things dont turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans going astray 9 souls is an perky spiritual journey from japanese director toshiaki toyada which flung its viewers into a film of two totally different halves the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence dramapacked second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with while the first half is quite amusing with its on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter but its really the genuinely haunting latter half with its peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these fleshout characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know its an effective drama when you become shellshocked in the dramatic change the nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down the way the plot works out is that michiru and torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study thats clear in its goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints while the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told the visual element doesnt go by unnoticed because theres just a dreamy and trancelike vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front the pacing for such an long film  2 hours  seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail while the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves i found 9 souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction highly recommended

1,Ok it wasn't the biggest horror movie ever seen in my life despite the fact that its lower budget has a pretty decent movie although monsters are unique and credible they are even kind of scary in the scenes where they show briefly ravage on this poor family although when you finally get to see the monsters completely you really think that if these biting things itty are after them the only part that really bothers me is when sniffing they killed the caty not the caty nooooooo why seriously if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore it's not the movie for you are going to rent the hills have eyes or something in the frame of these lines if you have little children I wouldn't recommend watching this with them though it would probably give them nightmares on trolls in their room

1,There are spoilers because of me having to describe some film techniques so read to your own riski loved this film the use of hues in some of the scenes made it seems like an old photograph come to life I also liked the projection of people on a rear screen for example in a leopold scene calls his wife and it is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen his face is huge in the back and the leos is in the foreground of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravines on the train a scene shot in an almost political style poster with close-up facials it reminds me of fighting potimkin this constant style intense coupled with the sprinkling of tons of horror without much gore even with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub you can't see the red water on the side it is one of the things I like to sort von's sub-state of horror that ends up making this film more creeping the use of text in the film as unique as when the character is never pushed by the word wowlf as the other man it knows

1,I really like this show it has dramatic romance and comedy all rolled up in one I'm 28 years old and I'm a married mother so I can identify both with loreleis and experiences of novels in the show I've been watching mainly rehearsals on the family channel lately so I'm not up to date on what's going on now I think that women would like this show more than men but I know that some men there would like that I really like it is an hour long and not half an hour as the time seems to fly when I look it gives her a chance if you've never seen the show I think lorelei and luke are my favorite characters on the show although mainly because of the way they're with the other how you might not see something was there or take so long to see it I guess I should say happy viewing

1,"This is a sorcerer and important people learn from tollingers the reputation of a city sorcerer can't be a forgotten room or a room much under the sight of a mysterious landowner who gradually takes off from them, they hold a meeting that chooses to engage tollinger to rid the city of his careless elementman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten room or a room much under the sight of a man at the moment when I write this it has a little over 200 voices and a little 9 user comments written for him a shame on either one or the other score because although the production values shout that it is a movie to the west it is a nice entry into the Western genre that the play takes on a plot theme rather similar to that of a haranged city that turns to a vengeed angel probably shows a lot of favors in the years that I myself read the synopsis and thinks that there is just a little darker picture that we see in the line of the image that we see in the darker one does not see much more than that we see in the line of the image that we see in the picture we see in the dark one way we see here we see here we see here is a little bit more"
1,"clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollingers reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of its unsavoury elementsman with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over 200 votes and a paltry 9 user comments written for it its a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasnt done the film any favours over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought its just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning storyrobert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we dont see his face but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchums shadow so really its solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high perhaps its unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the guns minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and cowritten by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but its dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable 7510

1,"this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldnt be seen unless youve seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldnt go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesnt stretch quite that far and its a far more zany rideessentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where its illegal to procreate sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive 2 and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isnt one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was antihomosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but i cant see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to doa 2 although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and its nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically theres a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments its a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isnt that part of the charm

1,"in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time the theme of workers v management with lots of talk of unions and rights perhaps dates the film a bit now as its no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesnt stop white suit from being a show stopping classicthe plot about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil doesnt sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences such as guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is full of dry wit  is he all right yes pity  and characterisation is first rate im always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well comedies of later eras would adopt a point the camera at the actors and let it roll mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations this film is no exceptionof course its the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance with eyes that convey wonder joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything hes ever worked for joan greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough everybody gets laughs without even trying to its comical british understatement at its finestthe man in the white suit is 81 minutes of sheer brilliance with a great plot great cast sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism absolutely top notch

1,"in 1982 two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens steven spielbergs et and john carpenters the thing of the two of them et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over even though the thing debuted first because people were so entranced with spielbergs warm fuzzy feelgood alien fable they stayed away from the thing in drovesits not hard to see why the two are diametrically opposed one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the stillbeating heart the other is a harsh uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the things tentacles and slime coated salivaits taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience as it should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake it takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genres showrunner alien and thats even rarercarpenters film follows its source material more faithfully than the thing from another world did it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation but although a bit thin on characterisation the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds themfrequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns hot off the success of escape from new york cast once again as one of carpenters perpetual antiheroes he plays macready the helicopter pilot at an antarctic research station what theyre researching is anyones guess the trouble begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over macreadys trying to gun down a siberian husky from the airthey end up dying for their troubles and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened they take in the husky and add it to their own except that this husky is not a husky at all but a shapechanging alien the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when they thawed it out it massacred their crew capable of absorbing its victims at will it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12man crew until noone is certain who is human and who is notthe thing is one of john carpenters finest films in fact im tempted to say its the best film hes ever made even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star the reason why i place the thing at the top of carpenters list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was slumming it films that didnt flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier worksbut the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree not even in the ferocious assault on precinct 13 from the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly and when he delivers his punches they come with an agonising joltthe film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror an approach that can often seem at odds with one another but in carpenters hands melds together beautifully bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects youll ever see in a horror film amorphous shapes halfformed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws spider legs and fully flexible tentacles indeed the films effects are so amazing and squirminducing the thing came under fire for being too realisticthat type of thinking misses the point entirely it only shortchanges the films values and there are many carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to its in the films quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows whispers and implications characterisation has never been one of john carpenters strong suits but it works to his advantage in the thing because we hardly know anything about the cast it only makes the present situation that much more confusing were never certain from one moment to the next who is who and because of this the thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewingsa special mention should go to the excellent film score from ennio morricone a pulsing thud thud every two seconds it creates an eerie spooky feeling that is very hard to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they bloodtest each other to see whos human is wound up with such dexterity by carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even realisingthe thing is a pure unadulterated classic even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well worth the reappraisal it received and so much better than et

1,It was probably one of the most well-made films of the 40s warner bros at the top of their style the photograph of soil polito is undoubtedly its most beautiful realization of the magnificent compositions and lighting with the delicate shade max steiner contributes to one of its most complex and beautiful scores the epitome of its method of classical leit motif music adds a great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable its interesting to note that the same production team that made this film has now made travel later that year a beautiful film that has won honors and rewards and descended as a historical ciefly favorite because it has starred bet disavowed in my opinion the gay sisters is a much better done film in all departments and more interesting complex and enjoyable a film that will entertain those who will take it for what it is rather than projecting their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding norms of hypercritical perfection each thing must be judged in its own time and for what is more interesting and enjoyable a film that will entertain those who take it for what it is rather than projecting their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding norms of hypercritical perfection each thing must be judged in its own time and for what it is for its own to do not to make a completely old film and its own.
1,"this was probably one of the most wellmade films of the 40s  warner bros at the very height of their style the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement  gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores  the epitome of his classical leit motif method the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable its interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make now voyager later that year  a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite ciefly because it starred bette davis in my opinion the gay sisters is a much better film  better made in all departments and more interesting complex and enjoyable a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection each thing has to be judged in its own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms most of the complaints ive read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point if youre hungry for a perfect filet mignon dont go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population sorry folks  maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots youd all be gleefully gratified ill take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week

1,"mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series in the continuing gundam chronicles unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars this one is a little different instead of having an armyvsarmy situation this one is led by five teenage boys due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults and their machines called gundams because of the metal alloy used in their construction which leads to problems since gundams are supposed to be destroyed replaced by mobile suits which are piloted lessdestructive weapon platforms and dolls which are ran on ai and are used as grunt infantrythe whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes its way here especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines such as naruto dragonball one piece dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from shonen jump which is now available in americamobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of overthetop battles between mortals who more resemble gods gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a small battle is to have it take a halfhour  something that would never happen in real life gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines will be destroyed and rebuilt battles will be lost and won and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satiricalbut the magic of gundam wing is in the details and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having emotion instead of mythic prophecies magic or overblown martial arts gundam wing is hardline science fiction from a country that hates hardline science fiction note the author would like to state that neon genesis evangelion is not hardlineplausibleinreallife science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series they love star wars but hate ai the movie henceforth why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for both japanese and us releases at the same time with two voice teams american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon networkthe emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards the heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam wing this is not war this is total war every person every building every street is a target for attack both on earth and offmy only complaint and the reason it didnt get the score of ten is that at about threefourths of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change kind of like a presenttime flashback which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between project meteor and oz but the final two episodes and the overplayedoncartoonnetwork back in 20012003 mobile suit gundam wing endless waltz movie more than make up for the slack

1,I've always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite movies it's a version of roegs stage play film and while most of the movie takes place in a hotel room it still has some very unique movie roegs flare is about a famous actress Theresa Russell who after a hard night of work on a film in 1954 goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel room they talk after a while she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to undress her husband gets fucked at the door her husband is a famous exbaseballist gary busey and he wants to know what is happening on all three in the hotel room talk about what is happening and what the future reserves them while a famous Senator tony Curtis does not let himself take the papers of professor if he doesn't witness a audition theresa Russell is just excellent and while she doesn't exactly try to impulse manoe I do a wonderful job of exhibe
1,"i have always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of roegs cinematic flare very unique story is about a famous actress theresa russell who after a hard nights work on a film in 1954 goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door her husband is a famous exbaseball player gary busey and he wants to know what is going on the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesnt testify at a hearing theresa russell is just excellent and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobias and nuances that monroe is very well known for one thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent case that this is russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at all times but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to emil how she does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this the professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film

1,"i stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the teevee late one night it has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later because of the important reallife lesson it teaches us about the dark side of human nature and although it tells a true story that takes place in wwii it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in europe todayif you thought ethnic cleansing as its called today has anything to do with race or ethnicity youll think differently after viewing this storyi guess id been pretty naive in thinking that evil follows any prescribed set of rules evil is as evil doesthis movie teaches a valuable lesson and i recommend it especially to eg church groups or civil rights organizationsi dont expect it will be too easy to find and rent but id really like to see it again because there is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of race expertise in this scene the protaganist who was taken prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an ss race authority and ushered into a room there the two play a sort of guessing game where the ss officer is able to determine where our hero anthony quinns character came from  and where his ancestors came from well come to find out that quinns character isnt a member of an inferior race after all but to the contrary hes a perfect archtypical aryan which doesnt mean a whole lot to quinns character who is more interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain ranges that the ss guy had just been naming nevertheless being a perfect aryan archetype has its perks among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored nazi uniforms yeah its a better gig for sure for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes until the allied armies arrive and recognize his face from magazine covers

1,I finally saw a clean copy of pakeezah until I had only a sneaky and glittering version of the song that I had in the 1990s with stunning English subtitles and a fluid color with a clean mind having thought of the world of such a poor and short copy that I found this one worthy of waiting and full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than I thought it was the pretty film meena kumaris from the beginning to the end and I think it had planned from 1958 to finally realize it in 1971 what shame chronic alcoholism finally killed her shortly after and in fact she was too ill to play in some of the scenes of pakeezah requiring a double body in some scenes that the strain definitely shows in her face the story of purity against adversity that I cannot treat as a fiction having no experience of anything near him but that she led to understand that there was a world so simple in a time that I had to share so much of the story that I could not treat as a fiction that had no experience of anything near him but that it led to understand that there was a world so simple in a time that I had to have had to do it in a single time that I had to share
1,"at last  ive finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now ive only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the 90s with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possiblethis was the lovely meena kumaris film from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from 1958 on finally realising it in 1971 what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah necessitating a body double in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her facethe story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but im led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india its a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but to me its the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar  especially thare rahiyo  and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding ive seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music  yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here albeit a classic duet with lata because of all this but not blind to its faults pakeezah is my favourite indian movie filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra
